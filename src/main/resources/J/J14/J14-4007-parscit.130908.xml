The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) was released to the public in 2008. It remains the largest
manually annotated corpus of discourse relations to date. Its focus on discourse relations that
are either lexically grounded in explicit discourse connectives or associated with sentential
adjacency has not only facilitated its use in language technology and psycholinguistics but also
has spawned the annotation of comparable corpora in other languages and genres.
Given this situation, this paper has four aims: (1) to provide a comprehensive introduction
to the PDTB for those who are unfamiliar with it; (2) to correct some wrong (or perhaps
inadvertent) assumptions about the PDTB and its annotation that may have weakened previous
results or the performance of decision procedures induced from the data; (3) to explain variations
seen in the annotation of comparable resources in other languages and genres, which should
allow developers offuture comparable resources to recognize whether the variations are relevant
to them; and (4) to enumerate and explain relationships between PDTB annotation and comple-
mentary annotation of other linguistic phenomena. The paper draws on work done by ourselves
and others since the corpus was released.

(Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), indicating relations between the events,
facts, states, and propositions conveyed in the text—relations that are essential to its
understanding. Some relations are signalled explicitly, as in Example (1), where the
underlined phrase as a result signals a causal relation between the situation described in
the first two sentences (called Arg1 in the PDTB, formatted here in italics) and a situation
described in the third sentence (called Arg2, formatted here in bold). Other relations
lack an explicit signal, as in Example (2), where there is no explicit signal of the causal
relation between the situation described in the first sentence and that described in the
second. Nevertheless, there is no change in meaning if the relation is made explicit—for
example, using the same phrase as a result (Martin 1992).

Over 18K explicitly signalled relations and over 16K implicit forms have been
annotated in the PDTB 2.0 (cf. Section 3.2, Table 1), which was released in February 2008,
through the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).1 Researchers since then, in both lan-
guage technology and psycholinguistics, have begun to use the PDTB in their research,
developing methods and tools for automatically annotating discourse relations (Wellner
and Pustejovsky 2007; Elwell and Baldridge 2008; Pitler et al. 2008; Pitler and Nenkova
2009; Wellner 2009; Prasad et al. 2010a, 2011; Zhou et al. 2010; Ghosh et al. 2011a, 2011b,
2012; Lin, Ng, and Kan 2012; Ramesh et al. 2012), generating questions (Prasad and
Joshi 2008; Agarwal, Shah, and Mannem 2011), ensuring an appropriate realization of
discourse relations in the output of statistical machine translation (Meyer 2011; Meyer
and Popescu-Belis 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013), and testing hypotheses about human
discourse processing (Asr and Demberg 2012a, 2012b, 2013; Jiang 2013; Patterson and
Kehler 2013). Other researchers have adapted the PDTB style of annotation to create
comparable resources in other languages and genres (Section 4).
What then are the aims of this paper? First, for those researchers who are unaware
of the PDTB, Section 2 of the paper lays out the key ideas behind the PDTB annotation
methodology, and Section 3 describes the corpus in more detail than previous papers
(Prasad et al. 2008; PDTB-Group 2008) and presents what we have learned since release
of the corpus in 2008. Secondly, for those researchers who have used the PDTB, Section 3
aims to point out significant features of its annotation that have either been ignored
or taken to be intrinsic when they are simply accidental. We hope that this will enable
researchers to derive more from the corpus in the future and recognize the value of
having it more completely annotated. Thirdly, annotation of comparable resources in
other languages and genres has turned out to vary from PDTB annotation in ways that
may be of interest to people contemplating the development of comparable resources
in other languages and genres. Section 4 summarizes and explains the sources of this
variation. Fourthly, Section 5 aims to show how PDTB annotation complements Time-
Bank (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a) and PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005)

the key points.
Although extensive documentation can be found on the PDTB Web site, along
with discussions of various aspects of PDTB annotation, there has not as yet been as
comprehensive and quantified a discussion of issues as presented here, especially con-
cerning comparable corpora and complementary annotation. Providing this discussion
is a major goal of this paper. We ourselves will be addressing many of these issues in
the next few years.

2. Key Ideas Underlying PDTB Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895846153846">
Two key ideas underlie the methodology used in annotating the PDTB, setting it apart
from other efforts to annotate discourse relations (e.g., Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski
2001; Polanyi et al. 2004; Baldridge, Asher, and Hunter 2007). First, it makes no com-
mitment to any kind of higher-level discourse structure over the discourse relations
annotated between individual text spans. Thus, while theory-neutral itself with respect to
higher-level discourse structure, the PDTB invites experimentation with approaches to
high-level topic and functional structuring (Stede 2012; Webber, Egg, and Kordoni 2012)
or to hierarchical structuring (Mann and Thompson 1988; Asher and Lascarides 2003),
as a resource for research aimed at a “data-driven and emergent theory of discourse
structure” (Bunt, Prasad, &amp; Joshi 2012, page 61).
Secondly, the annotation of discourse relations is lexically grounded. Rather than
asking annotators to directly classify the sense of relations, which is a difficult task
(Stede 2008), annotators were asked to look at lexical items that can signal discourse
relations, such as the expression As a result in Example (1). When they did signal
discourse relations, their arguments and senses were then annotated. Annotators were
also asked to look at adjacent sentences that lacked one of these explicit signals. Where
they inferred a discourse relation, they first labeled it with a lexical item that could
serve as its explicit signal (such as As a result in Example (2)), before going on to classify
its sense. In both cases, this lexical grounding was aimed at making the annotation more
reliable, but it can also serve as a feature in the automated identification of discourse
relations mentioned in Section 1.
A more detailed introduction to the PDTB can be found in the PDTB-2.0 overview
paper (Prasad et al. 2008) and the PDTB-2.0 annotation manual (PDTB-Group 2008).
Other papers describe specific aspects of the annotation such as the senses used in
annotating relations (Miltsakaki et al. 2008), alternative lexicalizations (Prasad, Joshi,
and Webber 2010b), and attribution (Prasad et al. 2007).

3. Key Features of PDTB Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999484">
Here we discuss four key aspects of PDTB annotation that have been partially ignored
or misunderstood: Explicitly signalled discourse relations; implicit discourse relations;
properties of the arguments to discourse relations; and several issues concerning the
senses of discourse relations and their annotation. These discussions extend the descrip-
tion of these features in the original PDTB overview paper and annotation manual.

3.1 Explicitly Signaled Discourse Relations

As Patterson and Kehler (2013) note, the inference of discourse relations may draw
heavily upon world knowledge, but may also be facilitated by specific linguistic signals.

It is these signals that we discuss here, distinguishing between (1) the linguistic expres-
sions that can explicitly signal a discourse relation; (2) the resource-limited subset of
these expressions that were annotated as such in the PDTB; and (3) the consequences of
this resource limit on annotation for using the PDTB.
We have taken the view that discourse relations hold between two and only two
(possibly discontinuous) spans of text that can be interpreted as propositions, eventual-
ities, beliefs, etc. (what Asher [1993] has called abstract objects). As such, the spans are
primarily one or more sentences or clauses, and the expressions that can signal relations
between them come from four well-defined syntactic classes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999788833333333">
• Subordinating conjunctions: because, although, when, if, as, etc.
• Coordinating conjunctions: and, but, so, nor, or (and paired versions of the
latter — neither... nor, either... or)
• Prepositional phrases: as a result, in comparison, on the one hand... on the
other hand, etc.
• Adverbs: then, however, instead, yet, likewise, subsequently, etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999787">
These we have called discourse connectives, or explicit connectives.
During the pilot phase of PDTB annotation, we took as explicit signals of discourse
relations, linguistic expressions suggested by previous researchers (Halliday and Hasan
1976; Martin 1992; Knott 1996; Forbes-Riley, Webber, and Joshi 2006). This set was then
enlarged as new connectives were found in the WSJ corpus itself. Also identified during
this phase were productive modifiers of explicit connectives such as apparently, at least
partly, in large part, even, only, and so on, which were then annotated as connective
modifiers.2
What were not taken to be discourse connectives were adverbial cue phrases, includ-
ing sentence-initial Now (Example (3)), Well (Example (4)), So (Example (5)), and OK
(Example (6)), because they signal topic changes such as the beginning of a subtopic or
a return to a previous topic (Hirschberg and Litman 1993), rather than relating particular
discourse elements.

We did not intend to annotate as discourse connectives pragmatic markers such
as actually and in fact, which serve to signal the conversational role of the speaker’s
matrix utterance—specifically, that it is “either aligned with or contrary to something
previously said by another speaker, by the speaker on a previous occasion or to what
people in general say” (Aijmer and Simon-Vandenbergen 2004). But in fact was anno-
tated in the PDTB as a discourse connective, whereas actually was not. Nevertheless,

2 We have not yet seen much use made of these modifiers, even though it is clear that they can, for
example, be used to disambiguate connectives. (E.g., all tokens of modified ever since convey a
TEMPORAL sense, while only 51% of unmodified since do. Similarly, 76% of modified even though convey
the sense CONCESSION, whereas only 37.3% of unmodified though do.)

this accidental annotation provides interesting information on what discourse relations
pragmatic markers are associated with, which seems worth further study.
Resources then limited which types of explicit linguistic signals of discourse re-
lations were actually annotated as such. In particular, sentence-initial prepositional
phrases with an overt deictic argument (e.g., for that reason, by then) were not included in
the set of explicit discourse connectives and hence not systematically annotated because
it was felt this could be put off until deictic coreference was annotated more generally.
The consequences of limiting a priori what were taken as possible signals for a discourse
relation3 meant that adjacent sentences lacking one of these expressions might contain
a different sort of evidence for a discourse relation between them. The consequence for
annotating implicit discourse relations is described in the next section.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993964">
3.2 Implicit Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980272727273">
The PDTB calls discourse relations that lack an explicit discourse connective between
their arguments implicit discourse relations. Users of the PDTB thus need to under-
stand (1) where and how implicit relations were annotated and (2) what was done in
their absence.
As to the first point, the PDTB did not mandate unconstrained search for im-
plicit discourse relations. Rather, annotators were asked to consider implicit discourse
relations only between adjacent sentences within a paragraph, in the absence of an
explicit connective relating them. The procedure involved (1) identifying one or more
connectives that could be inserted between the two sentences without changing the
discourse relation(s) between them, and then (2) specifying the sense of those relations.
This had several consequences, each of which is discussed further in this section:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9847754375">
1. A sentence might bear no relation to its left-adjacent neighbor, even
though a wider search might find some earlier text to which it was related.
2. Paragraph-initial sentences were taken to have no left-adjacent neighbor
and were thus not examined as an argument to a discourse relation
unless they contained an explicit discourse connective.
3. Implicit discourse relations were not annotated within a sentence except
between clauses connected by a semicolon.
4. There were cases where annotators could not insert a connective between
sentences because to do so appeared redundant.
5. There were cases where annotators could not insert a connective between
sentences because they did not infer a discourse relation between them.
Rather, the later sentence simply provided more information about an
entity mentioned in the previous one.
6. Despite there being common patterns of multiple explicit connectives,
annotators were not asked whether an implicit discourse relation might
hold concurrently with a relation signalled with an explicit connective.
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.98856425">
3 “Possible” because many expressions on the list have non-discourse functions as well—e.g., in addition
to functioning as a discourse connective expressing a “result” relation, so can also function as an
intensifier (so short) or as part of the verb phrase anaphor do so. Part of the annotation process involved
excluding tokens that did not function as discourse connectives.

Point (1) has been addressed in the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011), which adheres to
most of the PDTB annotation conventions but allows an implicit discourse relation to
hold between non-adjacent sentences within the same paragraph (cf. Section 4.5). This
has reduced the proportion of potential implicit relations that were marked NoRel from
1.15% in the PDTB (254/22141, cf. Table 1) to 0.9% (29/3223) in the BioDRB (Prasad et al.
2011). The same choice was made in the Hindi DRB (Kolachina et al. 2012).
Points (2) and (3) remain gaps in PDTB annotation that we plan to address in the
future. Example (7) illustrates point (3): One could insert a connective such as afterwards
or thereafter before the free adjunct (i.e., afterwards returning ... ), making explicit the
relation of temporal PRECEDENCE between the event expressed in the main clause
and that in the free adjunct. (Arg1 and Arg2 are not indicated in italics and bold in
Example (7) because free adjuncts have not yet been annotated in the PDTB.)

In Section 5.2, we discuss how PropBank ArgM annotation can be used in addressing
gaps in the annotation of sentence-internal implicit relations in the PDTB.
With respect to point (4), cases where inserting connectives seemed redundant were
taken to arise from the relation being signalled by an expression from outside the set
of explicit connectives. These expressions were annotated as Alternative Lexicalizations
of evidence for discourse relations and their Arg1 and Arg2 annotated accordingly. We
have counted them under AltLex relations in Table 1 rather than as Implicit discourse
relations (also shown there). For example, in Example (8), inserting a connective like be-
cause between the sentences was felt to be redundant. Here, One reason is was annotated
as an alternative lexicalization of the causal relation between them (indicated in SMALL
CAPITALS adjacent to Arg2).

such as quite the contrary, eventually, and thereafter (nearly 15% of alternative lexical-
izations) meet all the criteria for explicit connectives, even though they had not been
included earlier. Another 9% of expressions were found to be phrases such as What’s
more (Example (9)), which suggests that the range of discourse connectives should be
widened to include other syntactic classes.

AltLex expressions are under-annotated in the PDTB because they were only an-
notated when annotators found it redundant to insert an implicit connective between
adjacent sentences. For example, whereas 15 tokens of that means were noticed and
annotated as AltLex, another 18 in the corpus were not examined, such as the one
following and in Example (10).

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999250333333333">
As a result, AltLex expressions cannot be exploited in machine learning—for example,
for inducing a model of discourse relation annotation—because no individual AltLex
expression can be guaranteed to be fully annotated in the corpus.
Everyone who has attempted to annotate or catalogue discourse connectives has
commented on the lack of a complete list of words and phrases serving this role (Versley
2010; Rysov´a 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013). Rather than provide annotators with an
incomplete list of connectives and allowing them to identify alternative lexicalizations
during annotation), one might consider giving them complete freedom as to what to
annotate as grounding for discourse relations. Although such a process has its own
problems (Section 4.1), expert annotators and good training may make it a plausible
basis for effective discourse annotation.
As for point (5), if annotators were unable to insert a connective between sentences
because they were not able to infer a discourse relation between them, they were asked
to check whether the second sentence provided more information about one or more
entities mentioned in the previous sentence, as in

If it did, annotators were told to annotate the relation type as EntRel. EntRel captures
entity-based coherence between sentences (Knott et al. 2001) realized either directly
(i.e., via an anaphoric pronoun or NP in the second sentence) or indirectly (i.e., through
a bridging inference). Annotators were not asked to annotate their evidence for EntRel.
Although it might be possible to use a resource such as the coreference annotation in
OntoNotes (Weischedel et al. 2012) to recover what the annotators had in mind, in cases
such as Example (12) the entity-based coherence is less obvious.

Such cases would benefit from the entity or entities that ground this relation being an-
notated explicitly, as well as provide valuable data for studies of entity-based coherence.
Table 1 also notes the 254 cases where the annotators did not see either an Alter-
native Lexicalization or an Entity-relation between adjacent sentences (within the same
paragraph). These they annotated as NoRel.
Point (6) involves the possibility of an explicit connective or AltLex expression
occurring concurrently with an implicit connective. That is, a recent unpublished pilot
study carried out at the University of Edinburgh (Jiang 2013) used MTurk to show that
readers presented with text containing a discourse adverbial also infer the sense asso-
ciated with a conjunction (coordinating or subordinating), even when no conjunction is
present in the text. The study involved 80 items taken from the freely available Corpus
of American English, each consisting of a clause, followed by a gap, followed by a clause
containing one of four discourse adverbials (after all, in fact, in general, instead). Each
HIT (Human Intelligence Task) consisted of one item and six conjunctions (and, because,
before, but, or, so, or none). The Turker was asked to insert into the gap, the conjunction
(or none) that seemed most natural between the clauses.
For example, in Example (13), 50/52 Turkers inserted but into the gap, showing
that they interpreted the relation between the clauses as being the same as if what was
explicit was but instead:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.753076">
(13) Logically, she should be dead. Instead, she feels fine, caring for her

In Example (14), 49/52 Turkers inserted so into the gap, showing that they interpreted
the relation as being the same as if what was explicit was so instead:

<listItem confidence="0.953626">
(14) He suspected he shouldn’t say that. Instead he lied.

<bodyText confidence="0.8737121">
Notice how different Example (13) would be if it were realized with so instead, or
Example (14) with but instead: Neither is what the writer intended.
The effect was less strong in Example (15), where 33/52 Turkers chose because,
showing that they interpreted the relation as being the same as because instead, whereas
the other Turkers chose differently among the other options:
(15) If he’d expected her to be upset, he was disappointed. Instead, she laughed,

Although it is not yet clear which discourse adverbials are compatible with one or more
concurrent implicit relations, it is nevertheless likely that such discourse relations are
under-annotated in the PDTB and should be addressed.

3.3 Arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999069285714286">
The two arguments to discourse relations contribute to the senses of the relations taken
to hold between them. The PDTB gives annotators two ways to restrict these arguments
to only the material needed for these relations.
As already noted, it is the events, states, propositions, claims, etc., in a text that
participate in discourse relations. In English, such abstract entities tend to be conveyed
through sentences, clauses, nominalizations, and verb phrases. Hence, these are what
can be annotated in the PDTB as arguments.4 Also because discourse deictics (e.g., this,

One way to limit arguments to only the minimal text needed for a given discourse
relation (a minimality principle), was to allow annotators to specify that other text ap-
peared relevant but not necessary to that interpretation. Specifically, they could annotate
as Sup?, material supplementary to Arg1, as in Example (17), where the preceding ques-
tion was annotated as relevant to interpreting the question response particle, and as
Sup2, material supplementary to Arg2, as in Example (18), where the material enclosed
in square brackets was annotated as relevant but not necessary to interpreting the
temporal relation expressed with then.

Supplementary information (both Sup? and Sup2) appears to have been under-
annotated in the PDTB, mainly because annotaters were only invited, and not required,
to check whether any text should be so annotated. This shows when one compares
the number of Sup? or Sup2 annotations on explicit discourse relations, which were
annotated first, with the number of such annotations on implicit discourse relations,
which were annotated on a subsequent pass: 1,571 explicit relations were annotated
with supplementary information, whereas only 126 implicit relations were, despite
nearly equal numbers of both. Before considering the existence of Sup? or Sup2 as a
feature indicative of the likely use of an explicit connective to signal a discourse relation
(Patterson and Kehler 2013), it must be assessed whether this is an accidental feature of
the PDTB’s annotation or an intrinsic feature of the discourse relations themselves.
A second way of limiting arguments to only the minimal text needed to complete
a given discourse relation involves the separate annotation of attribution (Prasad et al.
2007). This allows the attribution holding between an agent and an abstract object to
be included or excluded from the discourse relation as appropriate. For example, in
Example (19), annotators could exclude the attribution phrase “said Howard Rubel, an
analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York” from Arg1, as unnec-
essary for the discourse relation, while including the attribution phrase “Mr. Asman is
also annoyed” as necessary for the discourse relation in Example (20).5

5 The PDTB also annotates attribution relations, capturing their textual signal and semantic features over
each discourse relation and each of its arguments. For a full description of attribution and its annotation,
the reader is referred to Prasad et al. (2007). Attribution is now being annotated as a separate layer over
the WSJ (Pareti 2012), building on the PDTB attribution scheme, but aiming to capture the phenomena
more comprehensively than in the PDTB.

Attribution differs from supplementary information in that, when its polarity is
negative, it can interact with discourse relations. (Sup has no such interaction.) This
can be seen by contrasting Example (21), where (negative) denying is part of Arg2, and
Example (22), where (negative) denying is not part of Arg1, but is rather its attribution.

In Example (21), the wanting in Arg1 is taken to contrast with the denying in Arg2. But
in Example (22), the negative polarity of denying as the attribution of Arg1 means that
being willing to negotiate is taken to further specify not using pressure tactics.
These techniques are concerned with excluding material unnecessary to concluding
the existence of a particular discourse relation. There is no comparable attempt to
ensure that spans annotated as arguments to discourse relations include all the features
that motivate a given relation (Section 3.4). This can be seen with discourse relations
associated with the connective instead. Its Arg1 must convey an alternative that does not
hold (Webber 2013): In Example (23), Arg1 conveys that “a price for the new shares has
been set” is an alternative that does not hold.
(23) No price for the new shares has been set. Instead, the companies will leave
it up to the marketplace to decide. [wsj 0018]
But the features that allow an argument to convey an alternative that does not hold
may not be present in the argument itself. For example, the PDTB annotators agreed
that the clause “to be any silver lining” was Arg1 of instead in Example (24), based on
the minimality principle mentioned at the start of this section. But there is nothing in
this argument that conveys that this alternative does not hold. That would require Arg1
to be “there isn’t likely to be any silver lining.” However, the annotators did not take
such an argument to be minimal.

Although in the majority of cases, minimal argument spans do contain all the features
needed to license the annotated sense, this was not required by the PDTB guidelines.
This point has been missed in efforts to use the PDTB in training automated sense

individual annotator could not decide among its more specific senses or if (2) pairs of
annotators disagreed as to a more specific sense.
Nevertheless, many researchers interested in inducing automated classifiers for
explicit and/or implicit discourse relations have used the four top-level (level-1) sense
classes for their research (e.g., Pitler et al. 2008; Pitler and Nenkova 2009; Zhou et al.
2010) because of the relatively large number of tokens in each class at this level of
specificity (Table 2).
Our goal here is not to defend the hierarchy or its sense inventory, but rather to
discuss three issues in sense labeling, which should help readers to better understand
both the PDTB and the comparable corpora described in Section 4. The issues are:
(1) senses found to be missing from the sense inventory; (2) disagreements between
annotators; and (3) annotation of multiple concurrent discourse relations.
3.4.1 Missing Senses. We have long realized that there are gaps in the set of available
senses. Some of these gaps are noted in the PDTB Annotation Manual (PDTB-Group
2008), such as the absense of a SIMILARITY sense for labeling explicit relations headed
by as if and the absense of a PURPOSE sense for labeling explicit relations headed by

so that. Cases of the latter, as well as relations conveying the sense that one argument
was the GOAL of the other, were simply annotated with the overloaded label CON-
TINGENCY.CAUSE.RESULT. The 34 cases of the subordinating conjunction just as, which
can also signal SIMILARITY, were found on subsequent analysis of the corpus to be
annotated as either TEMPORAL.SYNCHRONY (13 tokens) or EXPANSION.CONJUNCTION
(1 token), or to have been left unannotated (20 tokens).
Some of these and other missing senses have been added to the sense inventories
used in annotating corpora comparable to the PDTB (Section 4.2). They should also be
added to the PDTB, and senses known to be overloaded should be split appropriately.
Although this will eliminate already noted sense gaps, the potential remains for addi-
tional senses to be identified, and hence this remains a problem.
3.4.2 Disagreements Between Annotators. Sense annotation was done by two annotators.
Disagreement at level-1 occurred when the two annotators picked senses that belonged
at or under different level-1 classes. Disagreement at level-2 occurred when the an-
notators picked senses within the same level-1 class but different level-2 classes (e.g.,
CONTRAST versus CONCESSION). Similarly, disagreement at level-3 occurred when the
annotators picked different senses under the same level-2 sense class (e.g., JUXTAPOSI-
TION versus OPPOSITION).
Adjudication for disagreement at level-1 was done manually, by a team of experts,
and disagreements at level-2 or level-3 were handled through automatic back-off to
the next higher level. For example, a JUXTAPOSITION versus OPPOSITION disagreement
would lead to a relation being automatically assigned their level-2 parent, namely,
CONTRAST.
Annotation associated with automated back-off has contributed to there being only
a level-1 sense annotation for 444 explicit and 257 implicit relations in the PDTB, almost
all of which are either COMPARISON or EXPANSION. Although neither label is very
informative, one might interpret such a label simply as under-specified with respect
to its more specific level-2 daughters.
3.4.3 Multiple Concurrent Discourse Relations. Researchers using the PDTB for automated
sense labeling of discourse relations have, by and large, assumed that its four level-1
senses (Figure 1) are disjoint. That is incorrect. Particular level-3 senses may be dis-
joint because they are defined as each other’s inverse and hence can’t both hold—
for example, REASON and RESULT, PRECEDENCE and SUCCESSION, EXPECTATION and
CONTRA-EXPECTATION. Other senses may be disjoint because their defining inferences
contradict one another: for example, REASON requires Arg2 to precede or coincide with
Arg1, whereas PRECEDENCE requires that Arg1 precede Arg2. They cannot both hold.
However, most senses are compatible.

This is evident in the fact that annotators were allowed to assign up to two sense la-
bels to each explicit or implicit connective, representing concurrent discourse relations.
With explicit connectives, 999 of the 18,459 tokens (5.4%) were assigned two concurrent
sense labels, with the most common pairs shown in Table 3.
Is 5.4% an accurate indicator of the frequency of multiple concurrent discourse rela-
tions between two arguments when they are linked by an explicit discourse connective?
Evidence for a higher figure comes from an early experiment with two connectives,
since and when (Miltsakaki et al. 2005). There, two annotators were given the option of
labeling relations linked by one of these connectives in the WSJ corpus as either TEM-
PORAL or CAUSAL or TEMPORAL/CAUSAL, to indicate that both senses were conveyed.
(The experiment was done on the 184 relations in the corpus headed by since and the
first 100 relations headed by when, out of a total of 989.6) Those headed by since were
annotated TEMPORAL/CAUSAL 21 times by one of the annotators (11.3%) and 16 times
by the other (8.6%). Those headed by when were annotated TEMPORAL/CAUSAL even
more frequently: 22% by one annotator and 28% by the other.
Compare this with the counts for multiply-labeled since and when in Table 3: Only
10/184 tokens of since (5.4%) were annotated with both a TEMPORAL and a CAUSAL
sense, and only 184/989 tokens of when (18.6%) were annotated with both some kind
of TEMPORAL and some kind of CAUSAL sense. In both cases, this is significantly less
frequent than in the earlier experiment, suggesting that if annotators are not given
explicit joint-sense options (such as TEMPORAL/CAUSAL or more specific pairs) and
only invited to use multiple concurrent sense labels if they take multiple discourse
relations to hold, their use of multiple labels may be intermittent at best. This is a
loss to both language technology and theoretical and psycholinguistic understanding
of discourse relations, and a situation that deserves to be fixed.

In the case of implicit discourse relations, annotators could assign more than one
sense label to a single implicit connective or they could insert more than one implicit
connective, which were then individually sense-labeled. Both options indicated that
concurrent discourse relations could be taken to hold between the specified arguments.
Of the 16,224 implicit relations, 359 (2.2%) were annotated with a single implicit connec-
tive with multiple senses, and 171 (1.1%) were annotated with two implicit connectives,
each taken to have a single sense. Both of these are very small numbers, so no hard
conclusions can be drawn. Nevertheless, one might sample whether more of the implicit
relations annotated with some CAUSAL sense might be more accurately annotated with
some TEMPORAL sense as well.
We close by noting that of the 171 cases annotated with two implicit connectives,
with each assigned a single sense, over half (93/171 = 54.4%) involved a connective
paired with for example, for instance, or for one thing (e.g., since, for example; as, for instance;
because, for one thing); 13 more (7.5%) were paired with in particular or specifically (e.g., in
particular, because; specifically, because) and another 13 (7.5%) were paired with in fact (e.g.,
although, in fact; so, in fact). All but in fact are really connective modifiers (Section 3.1),
even though they can also appear separately as connectives in their right. Such cases
deserve further analysis, in connection with getting a better understanding of modified
connectives, their prevalence, and their semantics.

4. Annotated Corpora Comparable to the PDTB
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859714285714">
We noted in Section 1 that release of the PDTB has spawned similar efforts to annotate
resources in other languages and genres following a lexically grounded approach to
discourse relations. We also noted that these efforts vary in interesting ways from that
of the PDTB. Here we describe both the nature and the sources of this variation, so that
people contemplating development of comparable resources in additional languages
and/or genres will recognize variation that is appropriate to their situation, while
avoiding unnecessary variation that prevents inter-operability of these comparable
corpora (Bunt, Prasad, and Joshi 2012).
Table 4 identifies the corpora we will discuss and the extent of their current
annotation: the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011), the Leeds Arabic Discourse TreeBank, or
LADTB (Al-Saif and Markert 2010, 2011; Al-Saif 2012), the Chinese Discourse TreeBank
(Xue 2005; Zhou and Xue 2012; Zhou and Xue (in press)), the Turkish Discourse Bank
or TDB (Zeyrek et al. 2008, 2009; Aktas¸, Bozs¸ahin, and Zeyrek 2010; Zeyrek et al. 2010;
Demirsahin et al. 2013; Zeyrek et al. 2013), the Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (Oza et al.
2009; Kolachina et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2013), and the Prague Discourse TreeBank, or
PDiT (Mladov´a, Zik´anov´a, and Hajiˇcov´a 2008; Jfnov´a, Mfrovsk´y, and Pol´akov´a 2012;
Rysov´a 2012; Pol´akov´a et al. 2013), now part of the Prague Dependency TreeBank,
version 3.0, PDT 3.0 (Bejˇcek et al. 2013). (A comparable discourse treebank is being
developed for French (Danlos et al. 2012), but it has not yet been released and the
information needed to compare it to the other corpora in Table 4 is not available.)
Although these comparable corpora differ in ways to be discussed subsequently,
they all adhere to the key ideas of PDTB annotation (Section 2) in being neutral to any
discourse structure beyond the argument structure of individual discourse relations and
in grounding discourse relations in lexical expressions. Where they annotate implicit
discourse relations (Table 4), these comparable corpora follow the PDTB in annotating
an inferred lexical grounding.

4.1 Annotation Workflow
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991662">
Because one purpose of this section is to inform people considering the development of
similar resources in other languages and genres, we will briefly mention how workflow
has varied in the development of comparable corpora and how it has affected annotator
effort and inter-annotator agreement.
Workflow on the PDTB itself was based on the idea of using easier tasks to pave
the way for more difficult ones. In practice, this meant separating the annotation of
explicit and implicit relations, as explicits were perceived as easier to annotate. Explicit
discourse relations were annotated one connective at a time throughout the corpus,
before moving on to the next one on the list. The rationale for this was to improve the
annotators’ ability to annotate a particular connective by focusing their attention on
that connective. Subsequently, implicit discourse relations were annotated document
by document, analyzing each pair of adjacent sentences within each paragraph, as
described in Section 3.2. Later, senses were annotated for explicit and implicit discourse
relations—explicits by connective, and implicits by document.
Even for annotating explicit relations, this is not the only possible workflow. In
annotating the LADTB (Al-Saif 2012; Al-Saif and Markert 2011), the nature of Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) demanded a different workflow. In MSA, as in English, words
that can function as discourse connectives also have non-discourse functions. As such,
confirming that a potential connective has a discourse function is directly related to
identifying its arguments. One common form of argument to discourse relations in

Arabic news texts is an Al-maSdar noun, which is a tense-less expression of an event.7
Their frequency affected annotation workflow in the LADTB.
The LADTB used a workflow for annotating explicit discourse relations that in-
volved highlighting for the annotators all potential discourse connectives (including
word-initial clitics), based on a pre-compiled list. An annotator first read through the
entire text to achieve an overall understanding, before stepping through the highlighted
items one by one. In order to tell if a potential connective has a discourse function,
the annotator would see whether it had arguments, including strings interpretable
as al-maSdar nouns. Workflow thus involved simultaneous confirmation of potential
discourse connectives and identification of their arguments. After that, the annotator
would add the one or more senses that a relation expresses. If a potential connective
did not express a discourse function, the annotator would note it and go on to the next
highlighted item.
Workflow for the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011) was designed to address the difficulty
perceived in annotating inter-sentential relations in scientific text. On encountering a
new sentence, the annotator had to first mark its inter-sentential relation(s) with the
prior discourse, and only then annotate any intra-sentential relations within it. In this
way, annotators were made to first attend to relations that were harder to pin down, as
they progressed in their sequential reading and annotation of the text.
Ongoing annotation of the Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Zhou and Xue 2012) fol-
lows a fully sequential annotation strategy, largely for a language-specific reason—the
customary writing style of Chinese, which often does not bother to distinguish the
end of a sentence (marked with a full stop) from the end of a clause (marked with a
comma). This has two major consequences: No rigid distinction can be made between
inter- and intra-sentential connectives, and annotators must consider implicit relations
both between full-stop delimited sentences and comma-delimited clauses. (The latter
have not been annotated in the current PDTB.) Annotating implicit relations between
comma-delimited clauses results in many more implicit relations. Zhou and Xue (2012)
report a 18–82% split in their data between explicit and implicit discourse relations,
compared with a 46–54% split in the PDTB. As such, having a separate task to cover
18% of the data was disfavored.
Although the particular style of annotation should have no effect on the content of
annotation, it can affect inter-annotator agreement. To this end, researchers developing
the Hindi DRB (Oza et al. 2009; Kolachina et al. 2012) carried out a systematic study
of three workflow strategies (Sharma et al. 2013). The first strategy modeled the task
exactly as in PDTB. In the second, explicits and implicits were annotated in exactly the
order in which they were encountered on a sequential reading of the text. The third
strategy operated per text, with annotators first marking all of its explicit connectives,
and then its implicit relations, before moving on to another text. The latter two strategies
were designed to ensure that annotators were aware of the coherence and flow of the
discourse when carrying out the task. Sharma’s findings show that better agreement is
obtained when the annotators’ attention is held to the text, but with no clear preference
for a fully sequential approach (as in the second strategy), or an approach that separated
the tasks on a text-by-text basis (as in the third).
Although ultimately, the choice of workflow may be language- or genre-specific,
as noted for Chinese, the final choice, then, should be driven by considerations of

Moens and Steedman 1988; Sweetser 1990; Jayez and Rossari 1998; Kehler 2002), among
others. Neither has been adopted without some change in the comparable corpora:
Additional senses have been introduced, while other senses have been eliminated or
modified; the sense hierarchy has been modified, and in one case, abandoned. For
example, Oza et al. (2009) propose a more general and uniform treatment of those dis-
course relations that are pragmatic, relating the speech act of one argument to either the
content or speech act of the other. Al-Saif and Markert (2011) do the same. Almost every
corpus includes at least one additional sense class, including SIMILARITY, PURPOSE,
BACKGROUND, and GRADATION, among others, motivated more by the genre of the
texts being annotated than by their language.
Changes in the PDTB sense hierarchy have been either at its root or its leaves:
The BioDRB has eliminated the four top-level classes, adopting a two-level hierarchy.
The Prague Discourse TreeBank (Pol´akov´a et al. 2012) now part of the PDT 3.0 and the
LADTB (Al-Saif and Markert 2011) have also adopted a two-level hierarchy, but they
preserve the top-level classes, collapsing the second and third levels of annotation. The
Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Zhou and Xue 2012) has eliminated the hierarchy entirely,
using a flat classification of just twelve sense categories. Sense annotation has not yet
begun on the Turkish Discourse Bank.
From the standpoint of interoperability, a shared assumption about the meaning
and classification of discourse relation senses is of utmost importance, because conflicts
in the assumed meaning of labels would preclude any kind of comparative studies
of the annotated resources, both within and across languages and domains. With the
growing number of variations in sense annotation schema, we believe it is critical to
collect the insights and findings from these studies and to find common threads, since
we believe there is much that is common between them. Indeed, some recent work
has usefully provided a mapping between their classification schemes and the PDTB
classification (Prasad et al. 2011; Zhou and Xue 2012).

4.3 Annotation of Explicit Connectives
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999306">
An obvious way in which the corpora vary is in the choice of explicit connectives to
be annotated. Because of the rich morphology of Turkish, explicit connectives in Turk-
ish include morphological suffixes attached to verb roots and complex subordinators
consisting of a connective and a nominalizing suffix. The former have not yet been
annotated in the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB), although the latter have been (Zeyrek
et al. 2013). Counterparts of the latter, called phrasal expressions in the TDB, appear as
AltLex in the PDTB. As in the LADTB (Al-Saif 2012), nominalizations are commonly
annotated as arguments in the TDB.
As well as being a morphologically rich language, with prefix clitics (as well as
separate words and phrases) serving as explicit connectives, Arabic writing tends

the equivalent of and commonly found at the beginning of sentences and paragraphs

4.4 Lexical Grounding for Implicit Discourse Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999377047619048">
The approach used in lexically grounding implicit discourse relations seems to be
language-specific. For English, the PDTB’s lexically grounded approach led to guide-
lines for annotating implicit relations in which annotators were asked to identify one
or more connectives that could be inserted between proposed arguments to express the
discourse relation(s) they took to hold between them (cf. Section 3.2). This was meant to
serve as explicit evidence for their decisions.
For the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, Zhou and Xue (2012) adopt a different strategy,
effectively using paraphrase rather than insertion. This is because, in a majority of cases,
the wording rejects insertion of a connective even if it expresses the underlying discourse
relation exactly (or sometimes, maybe the wording itself is the reason for not having a
connective). (Zhou and Xue 2012, page 73)
This suggests that Chinese may use particular syntactic constructions to indicate intra-
sentential discourse relations even more than English and German do (Meyer and
Webber 2013). Thus, instead of having their annotators insert explicit connectives, Zhou
and Xue (2012) have them paraphrase the relation between proposed arguments in terms
of explicit connectives that typically express each discourse relation. These prototypical
connectives then serve as the lexical grounding for the relation.
Although this is the only case we are aware of that has used a different approach
to lexically grounding implicit relations, it is something that corpus developers should
keep in mind, especially when considering the annotation of discourse relations within
sentences.

4.5 Locus of Implicit Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999329857142857">
The corpora differ in where they look for implicit discourse relations. As noted in
Section 3.2, implicit relations were only considered in the PDTB between adjacent
sentences within the same paragraph. Although a sentence might have an implicit
relation to a sentence further afield, we decided that it would add too much to an
already costly effort to have annotators seek them out. With respect to implicit discourse
relations within a single sentence, we are aware of having deliberately ignored (for lack
of resources) discourse relations that we know are there.
Where to look for implicit discourse relations is, in part, language-specific. We have
already noted (Section 4.1) that the structure of Chinese sentences is such that a much
larger proportion of discourse relations in Chinese occur intra-sententially. Hence the
greater need to look for them there.
As for looking for discourse relations further afield, the comparable corpora vary,
but not for language-specific reasons. Rather, it follows from the cost–coverage decision
that all annotation efforts face. In this case, in both the Hindi Discourse Resource and the

4.6 Naming Convention for Arg1 and Arg2
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973352941177">
One final way in which corpora comparable to the PDTB vary is with respect to the
naming convention for Arg1 and Arg2. In the PDTB, the choice follows syntactic criteria:
With explicit discourse connectives, Arg2 is the argument syntactically bound to the
connective, and Arg1 is the other argument. With implicit connectives, Arg1 is the left-
adjacent sentence, and Arg2, the right-adjacent one.
Although the same convention is followed in the BioDRB and Turkish Discourse
Bank, the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, the Prague Discourse TreeBank, and the Hindi
Discourse Resource have followed a semantically driven convention, in which argu-
ments that play the same semantic role have the same label. This then eliminates level-3
senses in the PDTB sense hierarchy (e.g., reason/result, expectation/contra-expectation,
precedence/succession) whose only purpose is to reflect the different linear order of
the arguments. Again, while these differences are admissible without impacting the
annotation scheme in any major way, comparative studies using these corpora need
to be sensitive to these differences. We note, however, that in an experiment using
this strategy for the Hindi annotation, Kolachina et al. (2012) report poor agreement
for arguments of relations, and speculate that it was harder for annotators to use the
semantic labeling convention.

Discourse annotation efforts that have followed the PDTB in adopting a lexically
grounded (or adjacency-based) approach to annotation nevertheless differ from the
PDTB in ways discussed earlier. Still, it appears that none of these differences is so great
as to affect their interoperability with the PDTB or each other, or their use in multi-
lingual language technology or machine translation (Meyer 2011; Meyer and Popescu-
Belis 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013).

5. Complementary Annotations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999293466666667">
Some of the linguistic phenomena annotated in the PDTB have also been annotated
in connection with other levels of linguistic annotation—in particular, the temporal
annotation of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank corpus found in
TimeBank 1.2 (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a) and the verb-argument annotation found in
PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005). Here we describe how these annota-
tions are related.
We had both practical and theoretical motivation for carrying out the work
described here. From a practical perspective, it might allow for future merging of
annotation layers (Pustejovsky et al. 2005), future seeding of one annotation layer with
another, and/or future consistency checking based on constraints between annotation
at different levels. From a deeper, theoretical perspective, the work has the potential to
lower, or even remove, barriers that have long existed between linguistic research at the
sentence level and at the discourse level—barriers that have been equally obstructive
to research in computational linguistics. This work can thus be seen as a small step
towards “the transition from sentence to discourse.”

5.1 TimeML and TimeBank
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979719375">
The TimeML temporal/event annotation (Pustejovsky et al. 2003b) of texts from the
Penn TreeBank forms part of the TimeBank 1.2 corpus (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a).
TimeML supports the annotation of events, time periods, and temporal relations,
expressed either explicitly or implicitly in a text. The information that TimeML makes
explicit includes temporal expressions such as the date 10/26/1989 (tagged as TIMEX3),
temporal events such as Nigel Lawson resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer (tagged
as EVENT), temporal signals such as after, during, and in (tagged as SIGNAL), and temporal
relations between pairs of temporal expressions or event instances, or between a tem-
poral expression and an event instance (tagged as TLINK). The set of temporal relations
comes from Allen (1984). When a temporal relation is explicitly indicated by a temporal
signal, the signal is included in the TLINK. This enables a clear correspondence with the
PDTB.
A temporal event is annotated on the head of the syntactic construction that expresses
it—the verb, in the case of a clause, as in the annotation of resume and warrant in
Example (25), where the SIGNAL until is asserted to signal the temporal relation between
resume and warrant.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.912430727272727">
(25) He &lt;EVENT&gt;said&lt;/EVENT&gt; &lt;EVENT&gt;construction&lt;/EVENT&gt; wouldn’t
&lt;EVENT&gt;resume&lt;/EVENT&gt; &lt;SIGNAL&gt;until&lt;/SIGNAL&gt; market conditions
&lt;EVENT&gt;warrant&lt;/EVENT&gt; it. [wsj 0610]
This corresponds to the PDTB annotation:
(26) He said construction wouldn’t resume until (TEMPORAL.ASYNCHRONOUS.
PRECEDENCE) market conditions warrant it.
But TimeML also annotates events expressed as nominalizations (e.g., construction
in Example (25)) and simple nouns (e.g., tax in Example (27)).
(27) And while there was no profit this year from discontinued operations,
last year they &lt;EVENT&gt;contributed&lt;/EVENT&gt; $34 million,
&lt;SIGNAL&gt;before&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;EVENT&gt;tax&lt;/EVENT&gt;. [wsj 0127]
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996724">
Because temporal events are not limited to clauses, signals of temporal relations are not lim-
ited to clausal coordinators or subordinators or discourse adverbials, but also include
prepositions such as before in Example (27). This is not annotated in the PDTB.
TimeML also allows for the annotation of certain non-temporal relations between
events, including conditional, evidential, non-evidential, and factive relations. These are
tagged SLINK (for Subordination Link). As with temporal relations, when these non-
temporal relations are indicated with a SIGNAL (such as if for a conditional relation),
the SIGNAL is included in the SLINK.
Although many of the same linguistic elements have been annotated in both
the PDTB and TimeBank, the annotation itself can be quite different. The sim-
plest difference relates to the sense of temporal relations: TimeML allows more
specific relations between events than the PDTB’s three broad relations TEMPO-
RAL.ASYNCHRONOUS.PRECEDENCE (before), TEMPORAL.ASYNCHRONOUS.SUCCESSION (after),
and TEMPORAL.SYNCHRONY (same time). For example, TimeML annotators can indicate
that one event is immediately before or immediately after another, although TimeBank
annotators have not used this when annotating relations signalled by before or after.
A more significant difference lies in where temporal relations are inferred in the
PDTB and TimeBank. As noted earlier, the PDTB aims to annotate every discourse

relation—including temporal relations—that holds between abstract objects (mainly
clausal or sentential interpretations) that are signaled by an explicit discourse connec-
tive (or some alternative lexicalization of a connective) or by the fact of sentence adjacency.
In the latter case, either an implicit discourse relation will be inferred between them, or
a relation involving some entity mentioned in the first sentence (EntRel), or no relation
at all (NoRel). In all cases, something will be annotated.
In contrast, TimeML guidelines specify that if a temporal relation is explicitly sig-
naled in the text, then events and/or time periods specified in different sentences may
be linked through signals such as previously, earlier, at the same time, then, or meanwhile. If
no temporal relation is explicitly signaled, then temporal elements in different sentences
are not linked, so there are no TLINKS in TimeBank corresponding to the PDTB’s 950
implicit temporal relations between adjacent sentences.
On the other hand, the TimeML guidelines allow a temporal relation to be in-
ferred from discourse relations that are not primarily temporal. For example, some
discourse relations annotated in the PDTB as causal (i.e., CONTINGENCY.CAUSE.REASON or
CONTINGENCY.CAUSE.RESULT) are annotated as temporal relations in TimeBank because
both arguments express temporal events and because a cause event starts before its
result. This is the case in Example (28), where TimeBank annotates the holding event
as occurring before the adjusting event, which has a negative polarity attribute.8 In the
PDTB, only the explicitly signaled causal relation is annotated.
(28) Previously, Columbia didn’t have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings
to reflect declines in market prices, because (CONTINGENCY.CAUSE.REASON)
it held the bonds as long-term investments. [wsj 1013]
However, not all relations annotated in the PDTB as CONTINGENCY.CAUSE.REASON have
a corresponding temporal annotation in TimeBank: Those corresponding to generic
statements (e.g., Example (29)) do not, because generic statements are not taken to
express temporal relations.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994436272727273">
Finally, there is some correspondence between PDTB annotation and the non-
temporal relations that TimeBank annotates as SLINK. What TimeBank annotates as a
conditional SLINK overlaps with the explicit discourse relations annotated in the PDTB as
CONTINGENCY.CONDITION. Other types of SLINK (modal, factive, evidential, and negative
evidential) are related to the properties of Attribution in the PDTB (cf. Section 3.3; Prasad
et al. 2007).
Enriching TimeBank relations based on annotation in the PDTB, and vice versa,
would require a more detailed study of both the annotation frameworks and annotation
practice in the two corpora. The same would go for using the annotation in one as a
consistency check on the other. Nevertheless, both would potentially be of great value
to delivering more usefully annotated resources.

More interesting is the relation between PDTB annotation of discourse relations and
PropBank annotation (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) of the sentence-internal ar-
gument structure. PropBank provides, for each verb predicate in the Penn TreeBank, its
sense and the semantic role of each of its arguments. An argument can be either required
by the verb through its valency and assigned an index such as Arg0, Arg1, and so on,
or accepted as a modifier (annotated with an ArgM label). ArgM arguments are further
assigned functional tags such as MNR (manner), MOD (modal), TMP (temporal), CAU
(causal), DIS (discourse), and so forth. For example, the PropBank annotation of one
instance of the verb rent is shown in Figure 2a. Besides its subject and object (Arg0 and
Arg1), the modal auxiliary will is annotated as ArgM-MOD and the subordinate clause
headed by until is annotated ArgM-TMP.
Many of the ArgM arguments in PropBank are either clauses or nominalizations
that denote events. Many of these align with discourse relations in the PDTB. For
example, the ArgM annotation of the subordinate clause in Figure 2a corresponds to
Arg2 of the PDTB annotation of the discourse relation associated with until (Figure 2b).
We can quantify the extent and nature of this correspondence between the two
annotation layers, and in doing so consider two related questions: (1) How many and
to what extent are the intra-sentential relations in PDTB also accounted for by the
dependencies annotated in PropBank, and (2) Are there gaps in the discourse-level
annotation that can be identified from the PropBank layer? Our analysis here is in
terms of the annotation in PropBank-1.9 Although the scope of this annotation has been
extended within the Ontonotes project (Weischedel et al. 2012), this does not affect our
general points.

There are 11,830 intra-sentential relations annotated in the PDTB, accounting for
28% of the discourse relations annotated in the corpus. Of these 11,830 relations (all of
which are candidates for overlap with PropBank), 11,236 involve explicit connectives
and 594 do not. The latter primarily hold between independent clauses separated by
a semicolon. As the clauses so-linked are independent, neither being a modifier of the
other, these relations are not covered in PropBank.
The other 11,236 intra-sentential relations include relations between clauses linked
by an explicit coordinating conjunction (such as and and but). Like the semicolon-
separated clauses, these are independent and so also outside the scope of PropBank. The
set also includes relations between clauses in the same sentence signaled by a discourse
adverbial. In PropBank, discourse adverbials are generally annotated as discourse-
linking modifiers (ARGM-DIS), leaving unspecified what they link to. For example,
in Example (30), the discourse adverbial instead conveys a relation between the two
“throwing” propositions. While PropBank annotates instead as ARGM-DIS of the main
clause throw, it does not explicitly link instead to its other argument.
(30) When the champ has lost his stuff, the great mystery novelist wrote, when he
can no longer throw the high hard one, he throws his heart instead. [wsj 1649]
PropBank-1 did not annotate arguments to copula verbs, so subordinating clauses
attached to these verbs were not covered. However, copula verbs have subsequently
been included in extensions covering over 75% of PropBank-1 and released as part of
Ontonotes-5.0, so these subordinating clauses are now marked as arguments.
Besides differing in terms of intra-sentential coverage, PropBank and the PDTB also
differ in their semantics. Specifically, even those PropBank ArgM roles that are closest
to discourse relations—ArgM-CAU (causal), ArgM-TMP (temporal), ArgM-PNC (pur-
pose), ArgM-MNR (manner), and ArgM-ADV (adverbial)—differ from the semantics of
PDTB senses in several ways.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.973992235294118">
• Specificity: ARG-TMP is annotated where the PDTB annotates a more
specific sense (Synchrony, Precedence, and Succession) of its top-level
class TEMPORAL.
• Heterogeneity: Subordinate clauses that are labeled as ArgM-ADV
correspond to the full range of PDTB senses.
• Multiplicity: The PDTB allows more than one sense label to be associated
with a single discourse connective to indicate that multiple sense relations
hold concurrently (e.g., a token of since may be labeled with both a
temporal and causal sense). In contrast, PropBank only permits a
constituent to fill a single functional role. Nevertheless, the seven cases
where subordinate clauses are annotated as causal (ArgM-CAU) in
PropBank and some form of TEMPORAL sense in the PDTB reveal
additional cases of the earlier-mentioned under-annotation of multiple
concurrent senses in the PDTB (Section 3.4.3).
• Coverage: The PDTB’s sense inventory currently lacks senses
corresponding to PropBank’s ArgM-MNR and ArgM-PNC roles.
This will be discussed in Section 5.2.2.

annotation is tied directly to the syntactic trees in the PTB. Figure 3(b) shows the
PropBank annotation of the verb say over the PTB parse tree shown in Figure 3(a), with
its initial when-clause parsed as a temporal modifier (ArgM-TMP) of say. In contrast,
PDTB annotation has been done over the raw text, with discontinuous spans permitted
as arguments. This allows attribution to be included or excluded from a discourse
relation (Section 3.3). In this case, Figure 3(c) shows attribution is excluded: The tem-
poral relation (SUCCESSION) is annotated between winning and awarding, implying that
Mr. Green’s winning of the verdict was followed by the judge giving him the additional
award. Given the difference in annotation practice, the extent of such mismatches
between PDTB and PropBank is expected to be the same as that between PDTB and
PTB (Dinesh et al. 2005).
In this section, we have considered whether the intra-sentential relations in the
PDTB (i.e., those with both arguments in the same sentence) can be fully accounted for
by the verb-ArgM dependencies in PropBank. We have shown that the account is only
partial, due in part to the significantly different goals of the two annotation projects
and in part to differences in methodological choices. As such, even intra-sententially, a
separate layer of discourse relation annotation is motivated.

any of the verb-ArgM dependencies in PropBank could potentially correspond to dis-
course relations that are not yet annotated in the PDTB. If the type and number of such
relations is significant, then PropBank annotations could be used to seed the PDTB with
new relations, which could then be corrected and/or annotated manually.
To do this, we aligned the PropBank annotations with the PTB and the PDTB. We
started by considering only the five ArgM types mentioned earlier, which gave us a
total of 43,432 verb–ArgM dependencies. For ease of analysis, we ignored the tokens of
split ArgMs (i.e., ArgMs that are not spanned by a single node). We also ignored tokens
from WSJ texts that were not included in the PDTB distribution because of problems
with conversion of the parsed files to stand off annotation format (PDTB-Group 2008).
From the total of 43,432 ArgMs, we identified 11,538 ArgMs as clausal, using the
PropBank alignment with the PTB. 4116 of these are free adjuncts (Example (31)), all of
which are new potential discourse relations to consider for the PDTB (cf. Section 3.2).
The remaining 7,422 clauses either start with a subordinator or subordinating con-
junction, including both finite (Example (32)) and non-finite (Example (33)) adverbial
clauses, or are reduced clauses (Example (34)). For these explicitly subordinated clauses,
PropBank alignment with the PDTB shows that explicit subordinators/subordinating
conjunctions were annotated as connectives in 5,471 of the 7,422 ArgMs, leaving the
remaining 1,951 ArgMs as new potential discourse relations for the PDTB. Each of
these 6,067 new potential relations identified from the PropBank (i,e., the 4,116 free
adjuncts and the 1,951 subordinated clauses) would still have to be reviewed manually
to determine whether it does in fact fulfill a discourse function or not.

New potential relations identified through PropBank would allow for expanding
not just the number of PDTB relations, but also the repertoire of connectives (such
as in case in Example (32)) and sense categories, in particular a MANNER relation,
corresponding to ArgM-MNR, and a PURPOSE relation, corresponding to ArgM-PNC,
that are not currently covered in the PDTB. It is important to note here that manner
and purpose arguments annotated in PropBank will only be considered arguments to
discourse relations when they denote events, facts, states, or propositions, since these
are what are taken to be arguments to discourse relations in the PDTB.

Linguistic annotation invariably involves a considerable amount of time and effort.
When linguistic analysis at multiple levels is encoded on the same source corpus as
different layers of annotation, there is potential value in assessing how the annotation

content of the different layers differ from each other, and in exploring how annotations
from one layer can be exploited usefully for annotation in other layers. This section has
compared the annotation content of the PDTB with that of TimeBank and PropBank,
showing that while some of the linguistic phenomena annotated in PDTB have also
been annotated in TimeBank and PropBank, there are significant differences in both the
extent and the content of the annotation. This section has also discussed some of the
ways in which annotations from one layer can enrich and/or improve the consistency
of annotation in other layers.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.873982">
Our goals in this paper have been to
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983090833333333">
• give a thoughtful description of the PDTB that reflects what we have
learned since release of the corpus in 2008;
• correct some assumptions about the PDTB that show that researchers
may either be ignoring significant features of its annotation of discourse
relations or taking accidental properties of its annotation to be intrinsic
properties of the discourse relations themselves;
• describe and place in context the ways in which annotation of comparable
resources in other languages and genres has varied from that of the PDTB;
and
• provide an analysis of the relation of PDTB annotation to that of TimeBank
and PropBank over the same Penn TreeBank corpus and show how they
are, in large part, complementary.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968875">
We hope that the number of researchers able to make use of the PDTB will continue
to grow, as will the number of similarly annotated corpora. We ourselves hope to
be able to enrich the PDTB in the future—widening the scope of discourse relations
that are annotated, improving the recording of evidence for annotation decisions, and
expanding the annotation to include additional textual genres, especially ones that are
less formal than news texts, such as public talks and consumer health advice. The
results should be of further benefit to a growing community of scholars and developers
considering the challenges of extended text.

<abstract confidence="0.987226">The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) was released to the public in 2008. It remains the largest manually annotated corpus of discourse relations to date. Its focus on discourse relations that are either lexically grounded in explicit discourse connectives or associated with sentential adjacency has not only facilitated its use in language technology and psycholinguistics but also has spawned the annotation of comparable corpora in other languages and genres.</abstract>

But in fact was annotated in the PDTB as a discourse connective, whereas actually was not. Nevertheless, 2 We have not yet seen much use made of these modifiers, even though it is clear that they can, for example, be used to disambiguate connectives. (E.g., all tokens of modified ever since convey a TEMPORAL sense, while only 51% of unmodified since do. Similarly, 76% of modified even though convey the sense CONCESSION, whereas only 37.3% of unmodified though do.) 924 Prasad, Webber, and Joshi Reflections on the PDTB this accidental annotation provides interesting information on what discour</context>

Because of the rich morphology of Turkish, explicit connectives in Turkish include morphological suffixes attached to verb roots and complex subordinators consisting of a connective and a nominalizing suffix. The former have not yet been annotated in the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB), although the latter have been (Zeyrek et al. 2013). Counterparts of the latter, called phrasal expressions in the TDB, appear as AltLex in the PDTB. As in the LADTB (Al-Saif 2012), nominalizations are commonly annotated as arguments in the TDB. As well as being a morphologically rich language, with prefix clitics (as well as separate words and phrases) serving as explicit connectives, Arabic writing tends 937 Computational Linguistics Volume 40, Number 4 towards long sentences conjoined with coordinating conjunctions (Ostler 1987), with the equivalent of and commonly found at the beginning of sentences and paragraphs (Al-Saif 2012).

Neither has been adopted without some change in the comparable corpora: Additional senses have been introduced, while other senses have been eliminated or modified; the sense hierarchy has been modified, and in one case, abandoned. For example, Oza et al. (2009) propose a more general and uniform treatment of those discourse relations that are pragmatic, relating the speech act of one argument to either the content or speech act of the other. Al-Saif and Markert (2011) do the same. Almost every corpus includes at least one additional sense class, including SIMILARITY, PURPOSE, BACKGROUND, and GRADATION, among others, motivated more by the genre of the texts being annotated than by their language. Changes in the PDTB sense hierarchy have been either at its root or its leaves: The BioDRB has eliminated the four top-level classes, adopting a two-level hierarchy. The Prague Discourse TreeBank (Pol´akov´a et al. 2012) now part of the PDT 3.0 and the LADTB (Al-Saif and Markert 2011) have also adopted a two-level hierarchy, but they preserve the top-level classes,</context>

The information that TimeML makes explicit includes temporal expressions such as the date 10/26/1989 (tagged as TIMEX3), temporal events such as Nigel Lawson resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer (tagged as EVENT), temporal signals such as after, during, and in (tagged as SIGNAL), and temporal relations between pairs of temporal expressions or event instances, or between a temporal expression and an event instance (tagged as TLINK). The set of temporal relations comes from Allen (1984). When a temporal relation is explicitly indicated by a temporal signal, the signal is included in the TLINK. This enables a clear correspondence with the PDTB. A temporal event is annotated on the head of the syntactic construction that expresses it—the verb, in the case of a clause, as in the annotation of resume and warrant in Example (25), where the SIGNAL until is asserted to signal the temporal relation between resume and warrant. (25) He &lt;EVENT&gt;said&lt;/EVENT&gt; &lt;EVENT&gt;construction&lt;/EVENT&gt; wouldn’t &lt;EVENT&gt;resume&lt;/EVENT&gt; &lt;SIGNAL&gt;until&lt;/SIGNAL&gt; market conditions &lt;EVENT&gt;warrant&lt;/EVENT&gt; it.

First, it makes no commitment to any kind of higher-level discourse structure over the discourse relations annotated between individual text spans. Thus, while theory-neutral itself with respect to higher-level discourse structure, the PDTB invites experimentation with approaches to high-level topic and functional structuring (Stede 2012; Webber, Egg, and Kordoni 2012) or to hierarchical structuring (Mann and Thompson 1988; Asher and Lascarides 2003), as a resource for research aimed at a “data-driven and emergent theory of discourse structure” (Bunt, Prasad, &amp; Joshi 2012, page 61). Secondly, the annotation of discourse relations is lexically grounded. Rather than asking annotators to directly classify the sense of relations, which is a difficult task (Stede 2008), annotators were asked to look at lexical items that can signal discourse relations, such as the expression As a result in Example (1). When they did signal discourse relations, their arguments and senses were then annotated. Annotators were also asked to look at adjacent senten</context>

This allows attribution to be included or excluded from a discourse relation (Section 3.3). In this case, Figure 3(c) shows attribution is excluded: The temporal relation (SUCCESSION) is annotated between winning and awarding, implying that Mr. Green’s winning of the verdict was followed by the judge giving him the additional award. Given the difference in annotation practice, the extent of such mismatches between PDTB and PropBank is expected to be the same as that between PDTB and PTB (Dinesh et al. 2005). In this section, we have considered whether the intra-sentential relations in the PDTB (i.e., those with both arguments in the same sentence) can be fully accounted for by the verb-ArgM dependencies in PropBank. We have shown that the account is only partial, due in part to the significantly different goals of the two annotation projects and in part to differences in methodological choices. As such, even intra-sententially, a separate layer of discourse relation annotation is motivated.

Table 1 also notes the 254 cases where the annotators did not see either an Alternative Lexicalization or an Entity-relation between adjacent sentences (within the same paragraph). These they annotated as NoRel. Point (6) involves the possibility of an explicit connective or AltLex expression occurring concurrently with an implicit connective. That is, a recent unpublished pilot study carried out at the University of Edinburgh (Jiang 2013) used MTurk to show that readers presented with text containing a discourse adverbial also infer the sense associated with a conjunction (coordinating or subordinating), even when no conjunction is present in the text. The study involved 80 items taken from the freely available Corpus of American English, each consisting of a clause, followed by a gap, followed by a clause containing one of four discourse adverbials (after all, in fact, in general, instead). Each HIT (Human Intelligence Task) consisted of one item and six conjunctions (and, because, before, but, or, so, or none). The Turker wa</context>

Interoperability among these resources is not an issue here, as long as whatever strategy is used yields highly consistent annotation. 4.2 Inventory and Organization of Senses The senses of discourse relations used in the PDTB and the hierarchy in which they are organized (Miltsakaki et al. 2008) drew on both in-house experiments (Miltsakaki et al. 2004, 2005) and previous work on the semantics of discourse relations (Lakoff 1971; Moens and Steedman 1988; Sweetser 1990; Jayez and Rossari 1998; Kehler 2002), among others. Neither has been adopted without some change in the comparable corpora: Additional senses have been introduced, while other senses have been eliminated or modified; the sense hierarchy has been modified, and in one case, abandoned. For example, Oza et al. (2009) propose a more general and uniform treatment of those discourse relations that are pragmatic, relating the speech act of one argument to either the content or speech act of the other.

Section 4.5). This has reduced the proportion of potential implicit relations that were marked NoRel from 1.15% in the PDTB (254/22141, cf.

Points (2) and (3) remain gaps in PDTB annotation that we plan to address in the future. Example (7) illustrates point (3): One could insert a connective such as afterwards or thereafter before the free adjunct (i.e., afterwards returning ... ), making explicit the relation of temporal PRECEDENCE between the event expressed in the main clause and that in the free adjunct.

Annotating implicit relations between comma-delimited clauses results in many more implicit relations. Zhou and Xue (2012) report a 18–82% split in their data between explicit and implicit discourse relations, compared with a 46–54% split in the PDTB. As such, having a separate task to cover 18% of the data was disfavored. Although the particular style of annotation should have no effect on the content of annotation, it can affect inter-annotator agreement. To this end, researchers developing the Hindi DRB (Oza et al. 2009; Kolachina et al. 2012) carried out a systematic study of three workflow strategies (Sharma et al. 2013). The first strategy modeled the task exactly as in PDTB. In the second, explicits and implicits were annotated in exactly the order in which they were encountered on a sequential reading of the text. The third strategy operated per text, with annotators first marking all of its explicit connectives, and then its implicit relations, before moving on to another text. The latter two strategies were designed to ensure that annotators were aware of the coherence and flow of the discourse when carrying out the task. Sh</context>

This then eliminates level-3 senses in the PDTB sense hierarchy (e.g., reason/result, expectation/contra-expectation, precedence/succession) whose only purpose is to reflect the different linear order of the arguments. Again, while these differences are admissible without impacting the annotation scheme in any major way, comparative studies using these corpora need to be sensitive to these differences. We note, however, that in an experiment using this strategy for the Hindi annotation, Kolachina et al. (2012) report poor agreement for arguments of relations, and speculate that it was harder for annotators to use the semantic labeling convention. 4.7 Summary Discourse annotation efforts that have followed the PDTB in adopting a lexically grounded (or adjacency-based) approach to annotation nevertheless differ from the PDTB in ways discussed earlier.

First, it makes no commitment to any kind of higher-level discourse structure over the discourse relations annotated between individual text spans. Thus, while theory-neutral itself with respect to higher-level discourse structure, the PDTB invites experimentation with approaches to high-level topic and functional structuring (Stede 2012; Webber, Egg, and Kordoni 2012) or to hierarchical structuring (Mann and Thompson 1988; Asher and Lascarides 2003), as a resource for research aimed at a “data-driven and emergent theory of discourse structure” (Bunt, Prasad, &amp; Joshi 2012, page 61). Secondly, the annotation of discourse relations is lexically grounded. Rather than asking annotators to directly classify the sense of relations, which is a difficult task (Stede 2008), annotators were asked to look at lexical items that can signal discourse relations, such as the expression As a result in Example (1). When they did signal discourse relations, their arguments and senses were then annotated. Annotators were also aske</context>

(10) “I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy, and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt,” said Garnett L. Keith Jr. ... [wsj 1694] As a result, AltLex expressions cannot be exploited in machine learning—for example, for inducing a model of discourse relation annotation—because no individual AltLex expression can be guaranteed to be fully annotated in the corpus. Everyone who has attempted to annotate or catalogue discourse connectives has commented on the lack of a complete list of words and phrases serving this role (Versley 2010; Rysov´a 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013). Rather than provide annotators with an incomplete list of connectives and allowing them to identify alternative lexicalizations during annotation), one might consider giving them complete freedom as to what to annotate as grounding for discourse relations. Although such a process has its own problems (Section 4.1), expert annotators and good training may make it a plausible basis for effective discourse annotation. As for point (5), if annotators were unable to insert a connective between sentences because they were not able to infer a discourse relation between them, they were asked to chec</context>

For the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, Zhou and Xue (2012) adopt a different strategy, effectively using paraphrase rather than insertion. This is because, in a majority of cases, the wording rejects insertion of a connective even if it expresses the underlying discourse relation exactly (or sometimes, maybe the wording itself is the reason for not having a connective). (Zhou and Xue 2012, page 73) This suggests that Chinese may use particular syntactic constructions to indicate intrasentential discourse relations even more than English and German do (Meyer and Webber 2013). Thus, instead of having their annotators insert explicit connectives, Zhou and Xue (2012) have them paraphrase the relation between proposed arguments in terms of explicit connectives that typically express each discourse relation. These prototypical connectives then serve as the lexical grounding for the relation. Although this is the only case we are aware of that has used a different approach to lexically grounding implicit relations, it is something that corpus developers should keep in mind, especially when considering the annotation of discourse relations within sentences. 4.5 Locus of</context>

With explicit connectives, 999 of the 18,459 tokens (5.4%) were assigned two concurrent sense labels, with the most common pairs shown in Table 3. Is 5.4% an accurate indicator of the frequency of multiple concurrent discourse relations between two arguments when they are linked by an explicit discourse connective? Evidence for a higher figure comes from an early experiment with two connectives, since and when (Miltsakaki et al. 2005). There, two annotators were given the option of labeling relations linked by one of these connectives in the WSJ corpus as either TEMPORAL or CAUSAL or TEMPORAL/CAUSAL, to indicate that both senses were conveyed. (The experiment was done on the 184 relations in the corpus headed by since and the first 100 relations headed by when, out of a total of 989.6) Those headed by since were annotated TEMPORAL/CAUSAL 21 times by one of the annotators (11.3%) and 16 times by the other (8.6%). Those headed by when were annotated TEMPORAL/CAUSAL even more frequently: 22% by one annotator and 28% by the ot</context>

In both cases, this is significantly less frequent than in the earlier experiment, suggesting that if annotators are not given explicit joint-sense options (such as TEMPORAL/CAUSAL or more specific pairs) and only invited to use multiple concurrent sense labels if they take multiple discourse relations to hold, their use of multiple labels may be intermittent at best. This is a loss to both language technology and theoretical and psycholinguistic understanding of discourse relations, and a situation that deserves to be fixed. 6 Miltsakaki et al. (2005) reported 186 tokens of since as discourse connectives; PDTB-Group (2008) subsequently reported 184 tokens. Most likely, two were later found not to be connectives. 933 Computational Linguistics Volume 40, Number 4 In the case of implicit discourse relations, annotators could assign more than one sense label to a single implicit connective or they could insert more than one implicit connective, which were then individually sense-labeled.

In both cases, this lexical grounding was aimed at making the annotation more reliable, but it can also serve as a feature in the automated identification of discourse relations mentioned in Section 1. A more detailed introduction to the PDTB can be found in the PDTB-2.0 overview paper (Prasad et al. 2008) and the PDTB-2.0 annotation manual (PDTB-Group 2008). Other papers describe specific aspects of the annotation such as the senses used in annotating relations (Miltsakaki et al. 2008), alternative lexicalizations (Prasad, Joshi, and Webber 2010b), and attribution (Prasad et al. 2007). 3. Key Features of PDTB Annotation Here we discuss four key aspects of PDTB annotation that have been partially ignored or misunderstood: Explicitly signalled discourse relations; implicit discourse relations; properties of the arguments to discourse relations; and several issues concerning the senses of discourse relations and their annotation. These discussions extend the description of these features in the original PDTB overview paper and annotation manual. 3.1 Explicitly Signaled Discour</context>

Annotating implicit relations between comma-delimited clauses results in many more implicit relations. Zhou and Xue (2012) report a 18–82% split in their data between explicit and implicit discourse relations, compared with a 46–54% split in the PDTB. As such, having a separate task to cover 18% of the data was disfavored. Although the particular style of annotation should have no effect on the content of annotation, it can affect inter-annotator agreement. To this end, researchers developing the Hindi DRB (Oza et al. 2009; Kolachina et al. 2012) carried out a systematic study of three workflow strategies (Sharma et al. 2013). The first strategy modeled the task exactly as in PDTB. In the second, explicits and implicits were annotated in exactly the order in which they were encountered on a sequential reading of the text. The third strategy operated per text, with annotators first marking all of its explicit connectives, and then its implicit relations, before moving on to another text.

This shows when one compares the number of Sup? or Sup2 annotations on explicit discourse relations, which were annotated first, with the number of such annotations on implicit discourse relations, which were annotated on a subsequent pass: 1,571 explicit relations were annotated with supplementary information, whereas only 126 implicit relations were, despite nearly equal numbers of both. Before considering the existence of Sup? or Sup2 as a feature indicative of the likely use of an explicit connective to signal a discourse relation (Patterson and Kehler 2013), it must be assessed whether this is an accidental feature of the PDTB’s annotation or an intrinsic feature of the discourse relations themselves. A second way of limiting arguments to only the minimal text needed to complete a given discourse relation involves the separate annotation of attribution (Prasad et al. 2007). This allows the attribution holding between an agent and an abstract object to be included or excluded from the discourse relation as appropriate.

The paper draws on work done by ourselves and others since the corpus was released. 1.

Where they inferred a discourse relation, they first labeled it with a lexical item that could serve as its explicit signal (such as As a result in Example (2)), before going on to classify its sense. In both cases, this lexical grounding was aimed at making the annotation more reliable, but it can also serve as a feature in the automated identification of discourse relations mentioned in Section 1. A more detailed introduction to the PDTB can be found in the PDTB-2.0 overview paper (Prasad et al. 2008) and the PDTB-2.0 annotation manual (PDTB-Group 2008). Other papers describe specific aspects of the annotation such as the senses used in annotating relations (Miltsakaki et al. 2008), alternative lexicalizations (Prasad, Joshi, and Webber 2010b), and attribution (Prasad et al. 2007). 3.

Our goal here is not to defend the hierarchy or its sense inventory, but rather to discuss three issues in sense labeling, which should help readers to better understand both the PDTB and the comparable corpora described in Section 4. The issues are: (1) senses found to be missing from the sense inventory; (2) disagreements between annotators; and (3) annotation of multiple concurrent discourse relations. 3.4.1 Missing Senses. We have long realized that there are gaps in the set of available senses. Some of these gaps are noted in the PDTB Annotation Manual (PDTB-Group 2008), such as the absense of a SIMILARITY sense for labeling explicit relations headed by as if and the absense of a PURPOSE sense for labeling explicit relations headed by 931 Computational Linguistics Volume 40, Number 4 Table 2 Total explicit and implicit relations that fall under each level-1 sense. level-1 PDTB Senses No. of explicits No. of implicits CONTINGENCY 3,741 4,255 COMPARISON 5,589 2,503 EXPANSION 6,423 8,861 TEMPORAL 3,696 950 so that.

This is a loss to both language technology and theoretical and psycholinguistic understanding of discourse relations, and a situation that deserves to be fixed. 6 Miltsakaki et al. (2005) reported 186 tokens of since as discourse connectives; PDTB-Group (2008) subsequently reported 184 tokens. Most likely, two were later found not to be connectives. 933 Computational Linguistics Volume 40, Number 4 In the case of implicit discourse relations, annotators could assign more than one sense label to a single implicit connective or they could insert more than one implicit connective, which were then individually sense-labeled.

To do this, we aligned the PropBank annotations with the PTB and the PDTB. We started by considering only the five ArgM types mentioned earlier, which gave us a total of 43,432 verb–ArgM dependencies. For ease of analysis, we ignored the tokens of split ArgMs (i.e., ArgMs that are not spanned by a single node). We also ignored tokens from WSJ texts that were not included in the PDTB distribution because of problems with conversion of the parsed files to stand off annotation format (PDTB-Group 2008). From the total of 43,432 ArgMs, we identified 11,538 ArgMs as clausal, using the PropBank alignment with the PTB. 4116 of these are free adjuncts (Example (31)), all of which are new potential discourse relations to consider for the PDTB (cf. Section 3.2). The remaining 7,422 clauses either start with a subordinator or subordinating conjunction, including both finite (Example (32)) and non-finite (Example (33)) adverbial clauses, or are reduced clauses (Example (34)).

In both cases, this lexical grounding was aimed at making the annotation more reliable, but it can also serve as a feature in the automated identification of discourse relations mentioned in Section 1. A more detailed introduction to the PDTB can be found in the PDTB-2.0 overview paper (Prasad et al. 2008) and the PDTB-2.0 annotation manual (PDTB-Group 2008). Other papers describe specific aspects of the annotation such as the senses used in annotating relations (Miltsakaki et al. 2008), alternative lexicalizations (Prasad, Joshi, and Webber 2010b), and attribution (Prasad et al. 2007). 3. Key Features of PDTB Annotation Here we discuss four key aspects of PDTB annotation that have been partially ignored or misunderstood: Explicitly signalled discourse relations; implicit discourse relations; properties of the arguments to discourse relations; and several issues concerning the senses of discourse relations and their annotation. These discussions extend the description of these features in the original PDTB overview paper and annotation manual. 3.1 Explicitly Signaled Discourse Relations As Patterson and Kehler (2013) note, the inference of discourse relations may draw heavi</context>

Before considering the existence of Sup? or Sup2 as a feature indicative of the likely use of an explicit connective to signal a discourse relation (Patterson and Kehler 2013), it must be assessed whether this is an accidental feature of the PDTB’s annotation or an intrinsic feature of the discourse relations themselves. A second way of limiting arguments to only the minimal text needed to complete a given discourse relation involves the separate annotation of attribution (Prasad et al. 2007). This allows the attribution holding between an agent and an abstract object to be included or excluded from the discourse relation as appropriate. For example, in Example (19), annotators could exclude the attribution phrase “said Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York” from Arg1, as unnecessary for the discourse relation, while including the attribution phrase “Mr. Asman is also annoyed” as necessary for the discourse relation in Example (20).5 (19) Defense contractors “cannot continue to get contracts on that basis,” said Howard Rubel, an analyst with</context>

(29) It’s harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because (CONTINGENCY. CAUSE.REASON) some market makers don’t want to {take the orders}. [wsj 0585] Finally, there is some correspondence between PDTB annotation and the nontemporal relations that TimeBank annotates as SLINK. What TimeBank annotates as a conditional SLINK overlaps with the explicit discourse relations annotated in the PDTB as CONTINGENCY.CONDITION. Other types of SLINK (modal, factive, evidential, and negative evidential) are related to the properties of Attribution in the PDTB (cf. Section 3.3; Prasad et al. 2007). Enriching TimeBank relations based on annotation in the PDTB, and vice versa, would require a more detailed study of both the annotation frameworks and annotation practice in the two corpora. The same would go for using the annotation in one as a consistency check on the other. Nevertheless, both would potentially be of great value to delivering more usefully annotated resources. 8 http://www.timeml.org/site/publications/timeMLdocs/annguide_1.2.1.pdf, page 44. 941 Computational Linguistics Volume 40, Number 4 a.

The paper draws on work done by ourselves and others since the corpus was released. 1. Introduction The Penn Discourse TreeBank, or PDTB (Prasad et al. 2008; PDTB-Group 2008) is the largest manually annotated resource of discourse relations.

Other researchers have adapted the PDTB style of annotation to create comparable resources in other languages and genres (Section 4). What then are the aims of this paper? First, for those researchers who are unaware of the PDTB, Section 2 of the paper lays out the key ideas behind the PDTB annotation methodology, and Section 3 describes the corpus in more detail than previous papers (Prasad et al. 2008; PDTB-Group 2008) and presents what we have learned since release of the corpus in 2008. Secondly, for those researchers who have used the PDTB, Section 3 aims to point out significant features of its annotation that have either been ignored or taken to be intrinsic when they are simply accidental. We hope that this will enable researchers to derive more from the corpus in the future and recognize the value of having it more completely annotated. Thirdly, annotation of comparable resources in other languages and genres has turned out to vary from PDTB annotation in ways that may be of interes</context>

Annotators were also asked to look at adjacent sentences that lacked one of these explicit signals. Where they inferred a discourse relation, they first labeled it with a lexical item that could serve as its explicit signal (such as As a result in Example (2)), before going on to classify its sense. In both cases, this lexical grounding was aimed at making the annotation more reliable, but it can also serve as a feature in the automated identification of discourse relations mentioned in Section 1. A more detailed introduction to the PDTB can be found in the PDTB-2.0 overview paper (Prasad et al. 2008) and the PDTB-2.0 annotation manual (PDTB-Group 2008).

Here we describe both the nature and the sources of this variation, so that people contemplating development of comparable resources in additional languages and/or genres will recognize variation that is appropriate to their situation, while avoiding unnecessary variation that prevents inter-operability of these comparable corpora (Bunt, Prasad, and Joshi 2012). Table 4 identifies the corpora we will discuss and the extent of their current annotation: the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011), the Leeds Arabic Discourse TreeBank, or LADTB (Al-Saif and Markert 2010, 2011; Al-Saif 2012), the Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Xue 2005; Zhou and Xue 2012; Zhou and Xue (in press)), the Turkish Discourse Bank or TDB (Zeyrek et al. 2008, 2009; Aktas¸, Bozs¸ahin, and Zeyrek 2010; Zeyrek et al. 2010; Demirsahin et al. 2013; Zeyrek et al. 2013), the Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (Oza et al. 2009; Kolachina et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2013), and the Prague Discourse TreeBank, or PDiT (Mladov´a, Zik´anov´a, and Hajiˇcov´a 2008; Jfnov´a, Mfrovsk´y, and Pol´akov´a 2012; Rysov´a 2012; Pol´akov´a et al.</context>

In order to tell if a potential connective has a discourse function, the annotator would see whether it had arguments, including strings interpretable as al-maSdar nouns. Workflow thus involved simultaneous confirmation of potential discourse connectives and identification of their arguments. After that, the annotator would add the one or more senses that a relation expresses. If a potential connective did not express a discourse function, the annotator would note it and go on to the next highlighted item. Workflow for the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011) was designed to address the difficulty perceived in annotating inter-sentential relations in scientific text. On encountering a new sentence, the annotator had to first mark its inter-sentential relation(s) with the prior discourse, and only then annotate any intra-sentential relations within it. In this way, annotators were made to first attend to relations that were harder to pin down, as they progressed in their sequential reading and annotation of the text. Ongoing annotation of the Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Zhou and Xue 2012) follows a fully sequential annotation strategy, largely for </context>

With the growing number of variations in sense annotation schema, we believe it is critical to collect the insights and findings from these studies and to find common threads, since we believe there is much that is common between them. Indeed, some recent work has usefully provided a mapping between their classification schemes and the PDTB classification (Prasad et al. 2011; Zhou and Xue 2012). 4.3 Annotation of Explicit Connectives An obvious way in which the corpora vary is in the choice of explicit connectives to be annotated. Because of the rich morphology of Turkish, explicit connectives in Turkish include morphological suffixes attached to verb roots and complex subordinators consisting of a connective and a nominalizing suffix. The former have not yet been annotated in the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB), although the latter have been (Zeyrek et al. 2013). Counterparts of the latter, called phrasal expressions in the TDB, appear as AltLex in the PDTB. As in </context>

From a practical perspective, it might allow for future merging of annotation layers (Pustejovsky et al. 2005), future seeding of one annotation layer with another, and/or future consistency checking based on constraints between annotation at different levels. From a deeper, theoretical perspective, the work has the potential to lower, or even remove, barriers that have long existed between linguistic research at the sentence level and at the discourse level—barriers that have been equally obstructive to research in computational linguistics.

Zhou and Xue (2012) report a 18–82% split in their data between explicit and implicit discourse relations, compared with a 46–54% split in the PDTB. As such, having a separate task to cover 18% of the data was disfavored. Although the particular style of annotation should have no effect on the content of annotation, it can affect inter-annotator agreement. To this end, researchers developing the Hindi DRB (Oza et al. 2009; Kolachina et al. 2012) carried out a systematic study of three workflow strategies (Sharma et al. 2013). The first strategy modeled the task exactly as in PDTB. In the second, explicits and implicits were annotated in exactly the order in which they were encountered on a sequential reading of the text. The third strategy operated per text, with annotators first marking all of its explicit connectives, and then its implicit relations, before moving on to another text. The latter two strategies were designed to ensure that annotators were aware of the coherence and flow of the discourse when carrying out the task.

First, it makes no commitment to any kind of higher-level discourse structure over the discourse relations annotated between individual text spans. Thus, while theory-neutral itself with respect to higher-level discourse structure, the PDTB invites experimentation with approaches to high-level topic and functional structuring (Stede 2012; Webber, Egg, and Kordoni 2012) or to hierarchical structuring (Mann and Thompson 1988; Asher and Lascarides 2003), as a resource for research aimed at a “data-driven and emergent theory of discourse structure” (Bunt, Prasad, &amp; Joshi 2012, page 61).

Interoperability among these resources is not an issue here, as long as whatever strategy is used yields highly consistent annotation. 4.2 Inventory and Organization of Senses The senses of discourse relations used in the PDTB and the hierarchy in which they are organized (Miltsakaki et al. 2008) drew on both in-house experiments (Miltsakaki et al. 2004, 2005) and previous work on the semantics of discourse relations (Lakoff 1971; Moens and Steedman 1988; Sweetser 1990; Jayez and Rossari 1998; Kehler 2002), among others. Neither has been adopted without some change in the comparable corpora: Additional senses have been introduced, while other senses have been eliminated or modified; the sense hierarchy has been modified, and in one case, abandoned. For example, Oza et al. (2009) propose a more general and uniform treatment of those discourse relations that are pragmatic, relating the speech act of one argument to either the content or speech act of the other.

These techniques are concerned with excluding material unnecessary to concluding the existence of a particular discourse relation. There is no comparable attempt to ensure that spans annotated as arguments to discourse relations include all the features that motivate a given relation (Section 3.4). This can be seen with discourse relations associated with the connective instead. Its Arg1 must convey an alternative that does not hold (Webber 2013): In Example (23), Arg1 conveys that “a price for the new shares has been set” is an alternative that does not hold. (23) No price for the new shares has been set. Instead, the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide. [wsj 0018] But the features that allow an argument to convey an alternative that does not hold may not be present in the argument itself.

For the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, Zhou and Xue (2012) adopt a different strategy, effectively using paraphrase rather than insertion. This is because, in a majority of cases, the wording rejects insertion of a connective even if it expresses the underlying discourse relation exactly (or sometimes, maybe the wording itself is the reason for not having a connective). (Zhou and Xue 2012, page 73) This suggests that Chinese may use particular syntactic constructions to indicate intrasentential discourse relations even more than English and German do (Meyer and Webber 2013). Thus, instead of having their annotators insert explicit connectives, Zhou and Xue (2012) have them paraphrase the relation between proposed arguments in terms of explicit connectives that typically express each discourse relation. These prototypical connectives then serve as the lexical grounding for the relation. Although this is the only case we are aware of that has used a different approach to lexically grounding implicit relations, it is something that corpus developers should keep in mind, especially when considering the annotation of discourse relations within sentences. 4.5 Locus of</context>

Still, it appears that none of these differences is so great as to affect their interoperability with the PDTB or each other, or their use in multilingual language technology or machine translation (Meyer 2011; Meyer and PopescuBelis 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013). 5.

Because of the rich morphology of Turkish, explicit connectives in Turkish include morphological suffixes attached to verb roots and complex subordinators consisting of a connective and a nominalizing suffix. The former have not yet been annotated in the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB), although the latter have been (Zeyrek et al. 2013). Counterparts of the latter, called phrasal expressions in the TDB, appear as AltLex in the PDTB. As in the LADTB (Al-Saif 2012), nominalizations are commonly annotated as arguments in the TDB. As well as being a morphologically rich language, with prefix clitics (as well as separate words and phrases) serving as explicit connectives, Arabic writing tends 937 Computational Linguistics Volume 40, Number 4 towards long sentences conjoined with coordinating conjunctions (Ostler 1987), with the equivalent of and commonly found at the beginning of sentences and paragraphs (Al-Saif 2012).

Workflow on the PDTB itself was based on the idea of using easier tasks </context>

Workflow for the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011) was designed to address the difficulty perceived in annotating inter-sentential relations in scientific text. On encountering a new sentence, the annotator had to first mark its inter-sentential relation(s) with the prior discourse, and only then annotate any intra-sentential relations within it. In this way, annotators were made to first attend to relations that were harder to pin down, as they progressed in their sequential reading and annotation of the text. Ongoing annotation of the Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Zhou and Xue 2012) follows a fully sequential annotation strategy, largely for a language-specific reason—the customary writing style of Chinese, which often does not bother to distinguish the end of a sentence (marked with a full stop) from the end of a clause (marked with a comma). This has two major consequences: No rigid distinction can be made between inter- and intra-sentential connectives, and annotators must consider implicit relations both between full-stop delimited sentences and comma-delimited clauses. (The latter have not been annotated in the current PDTB.) Annotating implicit relations between co</context>

Changes in the PDTB sense hierarchy have been either at its root or its leaves: The BioDRB has eliminated the four top-level classes, adopting a two-level hierarchy. The Prague Discourse TreeBank (Pol´akov´a et al. 2012) now part of the PDT 3.0 and the LADTB (Al-Saif and Markert 2011) have also adopted a two-level hierarchy, but they preserve the top-level classes, collapsing the second and third levels of annotation. The Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Zhou and Xue 2012) has eliminated the hierarchy entirely, using a flat classification of just twelve sense categories. Sense annotation has not yet begun on the Turkish Discourse Bank. From the standpoint of interoperability, a shared assumption about the meaning and classification of discourse relation senses is of utmost importance, because conflicts in the assumed meaning of labels would preclude any kind of comparative studies of the annotated resources, both within and across languages and domains. With the growing number of variations in sense annotation schema, we believe it is critical to collect the in</context>

For English, the PDTB’s lexically grounded approach led to guidelines for annotating implicit relations in which annotators were asked to identify one or more connectives that could be inserted between proposed arguments to express the discourse relation(s) they took to hold between them (cf. Section 3.2). This was meant to serve as explicit evidence for their decisions. For the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, Zhou and Xue (2012) adopt a different strategy, effectively using paraphrase rather than insertion. This is because, in a majority of cases, the wording rejects insertion of a connective even if it expresses the underlying discourse relation exactly (or sometimes, maybe the wording itself is the reason for not having a connective). (Zhou and Xue 2012, page 73) This suggests that Chinese may use particular syntactic constructions to indicate intrasentential discourse relations even more than English and German do (Meyer and Webber 2013). Thus, instead of having their annotators insert explicit connectives, Zhou a</context>

Nevertheless, many researchers interested in inducing automated classifiers for explicit and/or implicit discourse relations have used the four top-level (level-1) sense classes for their research (e.g., Pitler et al. 2008; Pitler and Nenkova 2009; Zhou et al. 2010) because of the relatively large number of tokens in each class at this level of specificity (Table 2). Our goal here is not to defend the hierarchy or its sense inventory, but rather to discuss three issues in sense labeling, which should help readers to better understand both the PDTB and the comparable corpora described in Section 4.

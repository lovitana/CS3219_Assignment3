The written form of the Arabic language, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), differs in a non-
trivial manner from the various spoken regional dialects of Arabic—the true “native languages”
of Arabic speakers. Those dialects, in turn, differ quite a bit from each other. However, due to
MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic data sets have predominantly MSA content.
In this article, we describe the creation of a novel Arabic resource with dialect annotations. We
have created a large monolingual data set rich in dialectal Arabic content called the Arabic On-
line Commentary Data set (Zaidan and Callison-Burch 2011). We describe our annotation
effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each of more than 100,000 sentences from
the data set by crowdsourcing the annotation task, and delve into interesting annotator behaviors
(like over-identification of one’s own dialect). Using this new annotated data set, we consider
the task of Arabic dialect identification: Given the word sequence forming an Arabic sentence,
determine the variety of Arabic in which it is written. We use the data to train and evaluate
automatic classifiers for dialect identification, and establish that classifiers using dialectal data
significantly and dramatically outperform baselines that use MSA-only data, achieving near-
human classification accuracy. Finally, we apply our classifiers to discover dialectical data from
a large Web crawl consisting of 3.5 million pages mined from on-line Arabic newspapers.

The Arabic language is a loose term that refers to the many existing varieties of Arabic.
Those varieties include one “written” form, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and many
“spoken” forms, each of which is a regional dialect. MSA is the only variety that
is standardized, regulated, and taught in schools, necessitated by its use in written
communication and formal venues. The regional dialects, used primarily for day-to-
day dealings and spoken communication, remain somewhat absent from written com-
munication compared with MSA. That said, it is certainly possible to produce dialectal
Arabic text, by using the same letters used in MSA and the same (mostly phonetic)
spelling rules of MSA.

One domain of written communication in which both MSA and dialectal Arabic are
commonly used is the on-line domain: Dialectal Arabic has a strong presence in blogs,
forums, chatrooms, and user/reader commentary. Harvesting data from such sources
is a viable option for computational linguists to create large data sets to be used in
statistical learning setups. However, because all Arabic varieties use the same character
set, and furthermore much of the vocabulary is shared among different varieties, it is
not a trivial matter to distinguish and separate the dialects from each other.
In this article, we focus on the problem of Arabic dialect identification. We describe
a large data set that we created by harvesting a large amount of reader commentary
on on-line newspaper content, and describe our annotation effort on a subset of the
harvested data. We crowdsourced an annotation task to obtain sentence-level labels
indicating what proportion of the sentence is dialectal, and which dialect the sentence
is written in. Analysis of the collected labels reveals interesting annotator behavior
patterns and biases, and the data are used to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for
dialect detection and identification. Our approach, which relies on training language
models for the different Arabic varieties, greatly outperforms baselines that use (much
more) MSA-only data: On one of the classification tasks we considered, where human
annotators achieve 88.0% classification accuracy, our approach achieves 85.7% accuracy,
compared with only 66.6% accuracy by a system using MSA-only data.
The article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide an introduction to
the various Arabic varieties and corresponding data resources. In Section 3, we intro-
duce the dialect identification problem for Arabic, discussing what makes it a difficult
problem, and what applications would benefit from it. Section 4 provides details about
our annotation set-up, which relied on crowdsourcing the annotation to workers on
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. By examining the collected labels and their distribution,
we characterize annotator behavior and observe several types of human annotator
biases. We introduce our technique for automatic dialect identification in Section 5.
The technique relies on training separate language models for the different Arabic
varieties, and scoring sentences using these models. In Section 6, we report on a large-
scale Web crawl that we performed to gather a large amount of Arabic text from on-line
newspapers, and apply our classifier on the gathered data. Before concluding, we give
an overview of related work in Section 7.

2. Background: The MSA/Dialect Distinction in Arabic
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.961158384615385">
Although the Arabic language has an official status in over 20 countries and is spoken
by more than 250 million people, the term itself is used rather loosely and refers to
different varieties of the language. Arabic is characterized by an interesting linguistic
dichotomy: the written form of the language, MSA, differs in a non-trivial fashion from
the various spoken varieties of Arabic, each of which is a regional dialect (or a lahjah,
lit. “accent”; also darjah, lit. “modern”). MSA is the only variety that is standardized,
regulated, and taught in schools. This is necessitated because of its use in written
communication in formal venues.1 The regional dialects, used primarily for day-to-day
dealings and spoken communication, are not taught formally in schools, and remain
somewhat absent from traditional, and certainly official, written communication.
1 The term MSA is used primarily by linguists and in educational settings. For example, constitutions
of countries where Arabic is an official language simply refer to The Arabic Language, the reference to
the standard form of Arabic being implicit.

Unlike MSA, a regional dialect does not have an explicit written set of grammar
rules regulated by an authoritative organization, but there is certainly a concept of
grammatical and ungrammatical.2 Furthermore, even though they are “spoken” varieties,
it is certainly possible to produce dialectal Arabic text, by spelling out words using the
same spelling rules used in MSA, which are mostly phonetic.3
There is a reasonable level of mutual intelligibility across the dialects, but the
extent to which a particular individual is able to understand other dialects depends
heavily on that person’s own dialect and their exposure to Arab culture and literature
from outside of their own country. For example, the typical Arabic speaker has little
trouble understanding the Egyptian dialect, thanks in no small part to Egypt’s history
in movie-making and television show production, and their popularity across the Arab
world. On the other hand, the Moroccan dialect, especially in its spoken form, is quite
difficult to understand by a Levantine speaker. Therefore, from a scientific point of
view, the dialects can be considered separate languages in their own right, much like
North Germanic languages (Norwegian/Swedish/Danish) and West Slavic languages
(Czech/Slovak/Polish).4

2.1 The Dialectal Varieties of Arabic
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.818909">
One possible breakdown of regional dialects into main groups is as follows (see
Figure 1):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983660181818182">
• Egyptian: The most widely understood dialect, due to a thriving Egyptian
television and movie industry, and Egypt’s highly influential role in the
region for much of the 20th century (Haeri 2003).
• Levantine: A set of dialects that differ somewhat in pronunciation and
intonation, but are largely equivalent in written form; closely related to
Aramaic (Bassiouney 2009).
• Gulf: Folk wisdom holds that Gulf is the closest of the regional dialect to
MSA, perhaps because the current form of MSA evolved from an Arabic
variety originating in the Gulf region. Although there are major differences
between Gulf and MSA, Gulf has notably preserved more of MSA’s verb
conjugation than other varieties have (Versteegh 2001).
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.9587126875">
2 There exist resources that describe grammars and dictionaries of many Arabic dialects (e.g.,
Abdel-Massih, Abdel-Malek, and Badawi 1979; Badawi and Hinds 1986; Cowell 1964; Erwin 1963;
Ingham 1994; Holes 2004), but these are compiled by individual linguists as one-off efforts, rather
than updated regularly by central regulatory organizations, as is the case with MSA and many
other world languages.
3 Arabic speakers writing in dialectal Arabic mostly follow MSA spelling rules in cases where MSA
is not strictly phonetic as well (e.g., the pronunciation of the definite article Al). Habash, Diab, and
Rambow (2012) have proposed CODA, a Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic, to
standardize the spelling of Arabic dialect computational models.
4 Note that such a view is not widely accepted by Arabic speakers, who hold MSA in high regard. They
consider dialects, including their own, to be simply imperfect, even “corrupted,” versions of MSA,
rather than separate languages (Suleiman 1994). One exception might be the Egyptian dialect, where a
nationalistic movement gave rise to such phenomena as the Egyptian Wikipedia, with articles written
exclusively in Egyptian, and little, if any, MSA. Another notable exception is the Lebanese poet Said Akl,
who spearheaded an effort to recognize Lebanese as an independent language, and even proposed a
Latin-based Lebanese alphabet.

One possible breakdown of spoken Arabic into dialect groups: Maghrebi, Egyptian, Levantine,
Gulf, and Iraqi. Habash (2010) and Versteegh (2001) give a breakdown along mostly the same
lines. Note that this is a relatively coarse breakdown, and further division of the dialect groups
is possible, especially in large regions such as the Maghreb.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99856">
• Iraqi: Sometimes considered to be one of the Gulf dialects, though it has
distinctive features of its own in terms of prepositions, verb conjugation,
and pronunciation (Mitchell 1990).
• Maghrebi: Heavily influenced by the French and Berber languages. The
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.941541375">
Western-most varieties could be unintelligible by speakers from other
regions in the Middle East, especially in spoken form. The Maghreb is a
large region with more variation than is seen in other regions such as the
Levant and the Gulf, and could be subdivided further (Mohand 1999).
There are a large number of linguistic differences between MSA and the regional
dialects. Some of those differences do not appear in written form if they are on the level
of short vowels, which are omitted in Arabic text anyway. That said, many differences
manifest themselves textually as well:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986525230769231">
• MSA’s morphology is richer than dialects’ along some dimensions such
as case and mood. For instance, MSA has a dual form in addition to the
singular and plural forms, whereas the dialects mostly lack the dual
form. Also, MSA has two plural forms, one masculine and one feminine,
whereas many (though not all) dialects often make no such gendered
distinction.5 On the other hand, dialects have a more complex cliticization
system than MSA, allowing for circumfix negation, and for attached
pronouns to act as indirect objects.
• Dialects lack grammatical case, whereas MSA has a complex case system.
In MSA, most cases are expressed with diacritics that are rarely explicitly
written, with the accusative case being a notable exception, as it is
expressed using a suffix (+A) in addition to a diacritic (e.g., on objects
and adverbs).
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.764216666666667">
5 Dialects may preserve the dual form for nouns, but often lack it in verb conjugation and pronouns, using
plural forms instead. The same is true for the gendered plural forms, which exist for many nouns (e.g.,
‘teachers’ is either mςlmyn [male] or mςlmAt [female]), but not used otherwise as frequently as in MSA.

• There are lexical choice differences in the vocabulary itself. Table 1
gives several examples. Note that these differences go beyond a lack
of orthography standardization.
• Differences in verb conjugation, even when the triliteral root is preserved.
See the lower part of Table 1 for some conjugations of the root ˇs-r-b

<bodyText confidence="0.9931112">
This list, and Table 1, deal with differences that are expressed at the inidividual-
word level. It is important to note that Arabic varieties differ markedly in style and
sentence composition as well. For instance, all varieties of Arabic, MSA, and otherwise,
allow both SVO and VSO word orders, but MSA has a higher incidence of VSO sen-
tences than dialects do (Aoun, Benmamoun, and Sportiche 1994; Shlonsky 1997).

2.2 Existing Arabic Data Sources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998419222222222">
Despite the fact that speakers are usually less comfortable communicating in MSA than
in their own dialect, MSA content significantly dominates dialectal content, as MSA
is the variant of choice for formal and official communication. Relatively little printed
material exists in local dialects, such as folkloric literature and some modern poetry,
but the vast majority of published Arabic is in MSA. As a result, MSA’s dominance is
also apparent in data sets available for linguistic research. The problem is somewhat
mitigated in the speech domain, since dialectal data exists in the form of phone conver-
sations and television program recordings, but, in general, dialectal Arabic data sets are
hard to come by.

A few examples illustrating similarities and differences across MSA and three Arabic dialects:
Levantine, Gulf, and Egyptian. Even when a word is spelled the same across two or more
varieties, the pronunciation might differ due to differences in short vowels (which are not
spelled out). Also, due to the lack of orthography standardization, and variance in pronunciation
even within a single dialect, some dialectal words could have more than one spelling (e.g.,
Egyptian “I drink” could be bAˇsrb, Levantine “He drinks” could be byˇsrb). (We use the
Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter transliteration scheme to represent Arabic orthography, which maps
each Arabic letter to a single, distinct character. We provide a table with the character mapping
in Appendix A.)

What is this that is happening? What is this that I’m seeing?. As in Figure 2, the dialectal variant

The abundance of MSA data has greatly aided research on computational meth-
ods applied to Arabic, but only the MSA variant of it. For example, a state-of-the-art
Arabic-to-English machine translation system performs quite well when translating
MSA source sentences, but often produces incomprehensible output when the input
is dialectal. For example, most words of the dialectal sentence shown in Figure 2 are
transliterated, whereas an equivalent MSA sentence is handled quite well. The high
transliteration rate is somewhat alarming, as the first two words of the dialectal sentence
are relatively frequent function words: Aymt´y means ‘when’ and rH corresponds to the
modal ‘will’.
Figure 3 shows another dialectal sentence, this time in Egyptian, which again causes
the system to produce a poor translation even for frequent words. Case in point, the
system is unable to consistently handle any of Ayh (‘what’), Ally (the conjunction ‘that’),
or dh (‘this’). Granted, it is conceivable that processing dialectal content is more difficult
than MSA, but the main problem is the lack of dialectal training data.6
This is an important point to take into consideration, because the dialects differ to
a large enough extent to warrant treating them as more or less different languages. The

to-English MT system when a user inputs a Portuguese sentence. Figure 4 illustrates
how MT systems behave (the analogy is not intended to draw a parallel between the
linguistic differences MSA-dialect and Spanish-Portuguese). The MT system’s behavior
is similar to the Arabic example, in that words that are shared in common between
Spanish and Portuguese are translated, while the Portuguese words that were never
observed in the Spanish training data are left untranslated.
This example illustrates the need for dialectal data to train MT systems to handle
dialectal content properly. A similar scenario would arise with many other NLP tasks,
such as parsing or speech recognition, where dialectal content would be needed in large
quantities for adequate training. A robust dialect identifier could sift through immense
volumes of Arabic text, and separate out dialectal content from MSA content.

2.3 Harvesting Dialect Data from On-line Social Media
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997503555555556">
One domain of written communication in which MSA and dialectal Arabic are both
commonly used is the on-line domain, because it is more individual-driven and less
institutionalized than other venues. This makes a dialect much more likely to be the
user’s language of choice, and dialectal Arabic has a strong presence in blogs, fo-
rums, chatrooms, and user/reader commentary. Therefore, on-line data is a valuable
resource of dialectal Arabic text, and harvesting this data is a viable option for com-
putational linguists for purposes of creating large data sets to be used in statistical
learning.
We created the Arabic On-line Commentary Data Set (AOC) (Zaidan and Callison-
Burch 2011) a 52M-word monolingual data set by harvesting reader commentary from
the on-line versions of three Arabic newspapers (Table 2). The data is characterized
by the prevalence of dialectal Arabic, alongside MSA, mainly in Levantine, Gulf, and
Egyptian. These correspond to the countries in which the three newspapers are pub-
lished: Al-Ghad is from Jordan, Al-Riyadh is from Saudi Arabia, and Al-Youm Al-Sabe’ is
from Egypt.7
Although a significant portion of the AOC’s content is dialectal, there is still a very
large portion of it that is in MSA. (Later analysis in Section 4.2.1 shows dialectal content
is roughly 40%.) In order to take full advantage of the AOC (and other Arabic data sets

non-dialectal content automatically. The task of dialect identification (and its automa-
tion) is the focus for the remainder of this article. We next present the task of Arabic
dialect identification, and discuss our effort to create a data set of Arabic sentences with
their dialectal labels. Our annotation effort relied on crowdsourcing the annotation task

3. Arabic Dialect Identification
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948363636364">
The discussion of the varieties of Arabic and the differences between them gives rise
to the task of automatic dialect identification (DID). In its simplest form, the task is to
build a learner that can, given an Arabic sentence S, determine whether or not S contains
dialectal content. Another form of the task would be to determine in which dialect S was
written, which requires identification at a more fine-grained level.
In many ways, DID is equivalent to language identification. Although language
identification is often considered to be a “solved problem,” DID is most similar to a
particularly difficult case of language ID, where it is applied to a group of closely related
languages that share a common character set. Given the parallels between DID and
language identification, we investigate standard statistical methods to establish how
difficult the task is. We discuss prior efforts for Arabic DID in Section 7.

3.1 The Difficulty of Arabic DID
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999665125">
Despite the differences illustrated in the previous section, in which we justify treating
the different dialects as separate languages, it is not a trivial matter to automatically
distinguish and separate the dialects from each other. Because all Arabic varieties
use the same character set, and because much of the vocabulary is shared among
different varieties, identifying dialect in a sentence is not simply a matter of, say,
compiling a dialectal dictionary and detecting whether or not a given sentence contains
dialectal words.
This word-level source ambiguity is caused by several factors:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.985604">
• A dialectal sentence might consist entirely of words that are used across all
Arabic varieties, including MSA. Each of the sentences in Figure 5 consists

Zaidan and Callison-Burch Arabic Dialect Identification
of words that are used both in MSA and dialectally, and an MSA-based
dictionary would not (and should not) recognize those words as
out of vocabulary (OOV). Nevertheless, the sentences are heavily
dialectal.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992333555555556">
• Some words are used across the varieties with different functions. For
example, Tyb is used dialectally as an interjection, but is an adjective
in MSA. (This is similar to the English usage of okay.)
• Primarily due to the omission of short vowels, a dialectal word might
have the same spelling as an MSA word with an entirely different
meaning, forming pairs of heteronyms. This includes strongly dialectal
words such as dwl and nby: dwl is either Egyptian for these (pronounced
dowl) or the MSA for countries (pronounced duwal); nby is either
the Gulf for we want (pronounced nibi) or the MSA for prophet

<bodyText confidence="0.946922944444445">
(pronounced nabi).
It might not be clear for a non-Arabic speaker what makes certain sentences, such
as those of Figure 5, dialectal, even when none of the individual words are. The answer
lies in the structure of such sentences and the particular word order within them, rather
than the individual words themselves taken in isolation. Figure 6 shows MSA sentences
that express the same meaning as the dialectal sentences from Figure 5. As one could
see, the two versions of any given sentence could share much of the vocabulary, but
in ways that are noticeably different to an Arabic speaker. Furthermore, the differences
would be starker still if the MSA sentences were composed from scratch, rather than
by modifying the dialectal sentences, since the tone might differ substantially when
composing sentences in MSA.
Figure 5
Three sentences that were identified by our annotators as dialectical, even thought they do
not contain individually dialectal words. A word-based OOV-detection approach would
fail to classify these sentences as being dialectal, because all these words could appear
in an MSA corpus. One might argue that a distinction should be drawn between informal
uses of MSA versus dialectical sentences, but annotators consistently classify these sentences
as dialect.

• Distinguishing dialectal data from non-dialectal data would aid in creating
a large monolingual dialectal data set, exactly as we would hope to do
with the AOC data set. Such a data set would aid many NLP systems that
deal with dialectal content, for instance, to train a language model for
an Arabic dialect speech recognition system (Novotney, Schwartz, and
Khudanpur 2011). Identifying dialectal content can also aid in creating
parallel data sets for machine translation, with a dialectal source side.
• A user might be interested in content of a specific dialect, or, conversely,
in strictly non-dialectal content. This would be particularly relevant
in fine-tuning and personalizing search engine results, and could
allow for better user-targeted advertising. In the same vein, being
able to recognize dialectal content in user-generated text could aid in
characterizing communicants and their biographic attributes (Garera
and Yarowsky 2009).

• In the context of an application such as machine translation (MT),
identifying dialectal content could be quite helpful. Most MT systems,
when faced with OOV words, either discard the words or make an effort
to transliterate them. If a segment is identified as being dialectal first, the
MT system might instead attempt to find equivalent MSA words, which
are presumably easier to process correctly (e.g., as in Salloum and Habash
[2011] and, to some degree, Habash [2008]). Even for non-OOV words,
identifying dialectal content before translating could be critical to resolve
the heteronym ambiguity of the kind mentioned in Section 3.1.
4. Crowdsourcing Arabic Dialect Annotation
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890714285714">
In this section, we discuss crowdsourcing Arabic dialect annotation. We discuss how
we built a data set of Arabic sentences, each of which is labeled with whether or not
it contains dialectal content. The labels include additional details about the level of
dialectal content (i.e., how much dialect there is), and of which type of dialect it is. The
sentences themselves are sampled from the AOC data set, and we observe that about
40% of sentences contain dialectal content, with that percentage varying between 37%
and 48%, depending on the news source.
Collecting annotated data for speech and language applications requires careful
quality control (Callison-Burch and Dredze 2010). We present the annotation interface
and discuss an effective way for quality control that can detect spamming behavior. We
then examine the collected data itself, analyzing annotator behavior, measuring agree-
ment among annotators, and identifying interesting biases exhibited by the annotators.
In Section 5, we use the collected data to train and evaluate statistical models for several
dialect identification tasks.

4.1 Annotation Interface
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994525714285714">
The annotation interface displayed a group of Arabic sentences, randomly selected from
the AOC. For each sentence, the annotator was instructed to examine the sentence and
make two judgments about its dialectal content: the level of dialectal content, and its
type, if any. The instructions were kept short and simple:
This task is for Arabic speakers who understand the different local Arabic dialects,
and can distinguish them from Fusha8 Arabic.

The instructions were accompanied by the map of Figure 1, to visually illustrate
the dialect breakdown. Figure 7 shows the annotator interface populated with some

native speakers). The interface also had built-in functionality to detect each annotator’s

The interface for the dialect identification task. This example, and the full interface, can be
viewed at the http://bit.ly/eUtiO3.
Of the 3.1M sentences in the AOC, we randomly9 selected a “small” subset of about
110,000 sentences to be annotated for dialect.
For each sentence shown in the interface, we asked annotators to label which dialect
the segment is written in and the level of dialect in the segment. The dialect labels were
Egyptian, Gulf, Iraqi, Levantine, Maghrebi, other dialect, general dialect (for segments
that could be classified as multiple dialects), dialect but unfamiliar (for sentences that
are clearly dialect, but are written in a dialect that the annotator is not familiar with), no
dialect (for MSA), or not Arabic (for segments written in English or other languages).
Options for the level of dialect included no dialect (for MSA), a small amount of dialect,
an even mix of dialect and MSA, mostly dialect, and not Arabic. For this article we
use only the dialect labels, and not the level of dialect. Zaidan (2012) incorporates
finer-grained labels into an “annotator rationales” model (Zaidan, Eisner, and Piatko
2007).
The sentences were randomly grouped into sets of 10 sentences each, and when
Workers performed our task, they were shown the 10 sentences of a randomly selected
set on a single HTML page. As a result, each screen contained a mix of sentences across
the three newspapers presented in random order. As control items, each screen had two
additional sentences that were randomly sampled from the article bodies. Such sentences
are almost always in MSA Arabic, and so their expected label is MSA. Any worker
who frequently mislabeled the control sentences with a non-MSA label was considered
a spammer, and their work was rejected. Hence, each screen had twelve sentences in
total.
9 There are far fewer sentences available from Al-Ghad commentary than the other two sources over any
given period of time (third line of Table 2). We have taken this imbalance into account and heavily
oversampled Al-Ghad sentences when choosing sentences to be labeled, to obtain a subset that is more
balanced across the three sources.

With the aid of the embedded control segments (taken from article bodies) and expected
dialect label distribution, it was possible to spot spamming behavior and reject it. Table 3
shows three examples of workers whose work was rejected on this basis, having clearly
demonstrated they are unable or unwilling to perform the task faithfully. In total,
11.4% of the assignments were rejected on this basis. In the approved assignments,
the embedded MSA control sentence was annotated with the MSA label 94.4% of
the time. In the remainder of this article, we analyze only data from the approved
assignments.
We note here that we only rejected assignments where the annotator’s behavior
was clearly problematic, opting to approve assignments from workers mentioned later in
Section 4.2.3, who exhibit systematic biases in their labels. Although these annotators’
behavior is non-ideal, we cannot assume that they are not working faithfully, and
therefore rejecting their work might not be fully justified. Furthermore, such behavior
might be quite common, and it is worth investigating these biases to benefit future
research.

completed at least 10 HITs. Upon examination of the provided labels for the com-
mentary sentences, 40.7% of them indicate some level of dialect, and 57.1% indicate
no dialectal content (Figure 8a). Note that 2.14% of the labels identify a sentence as
being non-Arabic, non-textual, or as being left unanswered. The label breakdown is a
strong confirmation of our initial motivation, which is that a large portion of reader
commentary contains dialectal content.10
Figure 8 also illustrates the following:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995578416666667">
• The most common dialectal label within a given news source matches
the dialect of the country of publication. This is not surprising, since the
readership for any newspaper is likely to mostly consist of the local
population of that country. Also, given the newspapers’ countries of
publication, there is almost no content that is in a dialect other than
Levantine, Gulf, or Egyptian. For this reason, other dialects such as
Iraqi and Maghrebi, all combined, correspond to less than 0.01% of our
data, and we mostly drop them from further discussion.
• The three news sources vary in the prevalence of dialectal content. The
Egyptian newspaper has a markedly larger percentage of dialectal content
(46.6% of labels) compared with the Saudi newspaper (40.1%) and the
Jordanian newspaper (36.8%).
• A nontrivial amount of labels (5–8%) indicate General dialectal content.
The General label was meant to indicate a sentence that is dialectal but
lacks a strong indication of a particular dialect. Although many of the
provided General labels seem to reflect an intent to express this fact,
there is evidence that some annotators used this category in cases where
choosing the label Not sure would have been more appropriate but
was ignored (see Section 4.2.3).
• Non-Arabic content, although infrequent, is not a rare occurrence in the
Jordanian and Egyptian newspapers, at around 3%. The percentage is
much lower in the Saudi newspaper, at 0.8%. This might reflect the deeper
penetration of the English language (and English-only keyboards) in
Jordan and Egypt compared with Saudi Arabia.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892571428571">
We can associate a label with each segment based on the majority vote over the three
provided labels for that segment. If a sentence has at least two annotators choosing
a dialectal label, we label it as dialect. If it has at least two annotators choosing
the MSA label, we label it as MSA.11 In the remainder of the article, we will report
classification accuracy rates that assume the presence of gold-standard class labels.
Unless otherwise noted, this majority-vote label set is used as the gold-standard in such
experiments.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.949921">
10 Later analysis in Section 4.2.3 shows that a non-trivial portion of the labels were provided by MSA-biased
annotators, indicating that dialectal content could be even more prevalent than what is initially suggested
by the MSA/dialect label breakdown.
11 A very small percentage of sentences (2%) do not have such agreement; upon inspection these are
typically found to be sentences that are in English, e-mail addresses, romanized Arabic, or simply
random symbols.

The distribution of labels provided by the workers for the dialect identification task, over all
three news sources (a) and over each individual news source (b–d). Al-Ghad is published in
Jordan, Al-Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, and Al-Youm Al-Sabe’ in Egypt. Their local readerships are
reflected in the higher proportion of corresponding dialects. Note that this is not a breakdown
on the sentence level, and does not reflect any kind of majority voting. For example, most of
the LEV labels on sentences from the Saudi newspaper are trumped by GLF labels when taking
a majority vote, making the proportion of LEV-majority sentences smaller than what might be
deduced by looking at the label distribution in (c).
In experiments where the dialectal label set is more fine-grained (i.e., LEV, GLF, and
EGY instead of simply dialect), we assign to the dialectal sentence the label corre-
sponding to the news source’s country of publication. That is, dialectal sentences in the
Jordanian (respectively, Saudi, Egyptian) are given the label LEV (respectively, GLF, EGY).
We could have used dialect labels provided by the annotators, but chose to override
those using the likely dialect of the newspaper instead. It turns out that sentences with
an EGY majority, for instance, are extremely unlikely to appear in either the Jordanian or
Saudi newspaper—only around 1% of those sentences have an EGY majority. In the case
of the Saudi newspaper, 9% of all dialectal sentences were originally annotated as LEV
but were transformed to GLF. Our rationales for performing the transformation is that
no context was given for the sentences when they were annotated, and annotators had a
bias towards their own dialect. We provide the original annotations for other researchers
to re-analyze if they wish.

Even when a sentence would receive a majority-vote label that differs from
the news source’s primary dialect, inspection of such sentences reveals that the
classification was usually unjustified, and reflected a bias towards the annotator’s
native dialect. Case in point: Gulf-speaking annotators were in relatively short supply,
whereas a plurality of annotators spoke Levantine (see Table 4). Later in Section 4.2.3,
we point out that annotators have a native-dialect bias, whereby they are likely to
label a sentence with their native dialect even when the sentence has no evidence of
being written in that particular dialect. This explains why a non-trivial number of LEV
labels were given by annotators to sentences from the Saudi newspaper (Figure 8). In
reality, most of these labels were given by Levantine speakers over-identifying their
own dialect. Even if we were to assign dialect labels based on the (Levantine-biased)
majority votes, Levantine would only cover 3.6% of the sentences from the Saudi
newspaper.12
Therefore, for simplicity, we assume that a dialectal sentence is written in the
dialect corresponding to the sentence’s news source, without having to inspect the
specific dialect labels provided by the annotators. This not only serves to simplify our
experimental set-up, but also contributes to partially reversing the native dialect bias
that we observed.

agreement with regard to whether a segment is dialectal or not, with full agreement (i.e.,
across all three annotators) on 72.2% of the segments regarding this binary dialect/MSA
decision. This corresponds to a kappa value of 0.619 (using the definition of Fleiss
[1971] for multi-rater scenarios), indicating very high agreement.13 The full-agreement
percentage decreases to 56.2% when expanding the classification from a binary decision
to a fine-grained scale that includes individual dialect labels as well. This is still quite
a reasonable result, since the criterion is somewhat strict: It does not include a segment
labeled, say, {Levantine, Levantine, General}, though there is good reason to consider
that annotators are in “agreement” in such a case.

A bubble chart showing workers’ MSA and dialect recall. Each data point (or bubble) in
the graph represents one annotator, with the bubble size corresponding to the number of
assignments completed by that annotator.
So how good are humans at the classification task? We examine their classifica-
tion accuracy, dialect recall, and MSA recall. The classification accuracy is measured
over all sentences, both MSA and dialectal. We define dialect (MSA) recall to be the
number of sentences labeled as being dialectal (MSA), over the total number of sen-
tences that have dialectal (MSA) labels based on the majority vote. Overall, human
annotators have a classification accuracy of 90.3%, with dialect recall at 89.0%, and
MSA recall at 91.5%. Those recall rates do vary across annotators, as shown in Fig-
ure 9, causing some accuracy rates to drop as low as 80% or 75%. Of the annota-
tors performing at least five HITs, 89.4% have accuracy rates greater than or equal
to 80%.
Most annotators have both high MSA recall and high dialect recall, with about 70%
of them achieving at least 80% in both MSA and dialect recall. Combined with the
general agreement rate measure, this is indicative that the task is well-defined—it is
unlikely that many people would agree on something that is incorrect.
We note here that the accuracy rate (90.3%) is a slight overestimate of the human
annotators’ accuracy rate, by virtue of the construction of the gold labels. Because the
correct labels are based on a majority vote of the annotators’ labels themselves, the two
sets are not independent, and an annotator is inherently likely to be correct. A more
informative accuracy rate disregards the case where only two of the three annotators
agreed and the annotator whose accuracy was being evaluated contributed one of those
two votes. In other words, an annotator’s label would be judged against a majority vote
that is independent of that annotator’s label. Under this evaluation set-up, the human
accuracy rate slightly decreases, to 88.0%.

behavior. An annotator can be observed to have one or more of the following bias
types:14
• MSA bias/dialect bias: Figure 9 shows that annotators vary in how willing
they are to label a sentence as being dialectal. Whereas most workers (top
right) exhibit both high MSA and high dialect recall, other annotators have
either a MSA bias (top left) or a dialect bias (bottom right).
• Dialect-specific bias: Many annotators over-identify a particular dialect,
usually their native one. If we group the annotators by their native dialect
and examine their label breakdown (Table 4), we find that Levantine
speakers over-identify sentences as being Levantine, Gulf speakers
over-identify Gulf, and Egyptian speakers over-identify Egyptian. This
holds for speakers of other dialects as well, as they over-identify other
dialects more often than most speakers. Another telling observation
is that Iraqi speakers have a bias for the Gulf dialect, which is quite
similar to Iraqi. Maghrebi speakers have a bias for Egyptian, reflecting
their unfamiliarity with the geographically distant Levantine and
Gulf dialects.
• The General bias: The General label is meant to signify sentences that
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.924618444444444">
cannot be definitively classified as one dialect over another. This is the
case when enough evidence exists that the sentence is not in MSA, but
contains no evidence for a specific dialect. In practice, some annotators
make very little use of this label, even though many sentences warrant
its use, whereas other annotators make extensive use of this label (see,
for example, Table 5). One interesting case is that of annotators whose
General label seems to mean they are unable to identify the dialect,
14 These biases should be differentiated from spammy behavior, which we already can deal with quite
effectively, as explained in Section 4.2.

and a label like Not sure might have been more appropriate. Take the
case of the Maghrebi worker in Table 5, whose General bias is much
more pronounced in the Jordanian and Saudi newspapers. This is
an indication she might have been having difficulty distinguishing
Levantine and Gulf from each other, but that she is familiar with the
Egyptian dialect.

From a computational point of view, we can think of dialect identification as language
identification, though with finer-grained distinctions that make it more difficult than
typical language ID. Even languages that share a common character set can be distin-
guished from each other at high accuracy rates using methods as simple as examining
character histograms (Cavnar and Trenkle 1994; Dunning 1994; Souter et al. 1994), and,
as a largely solved problem, the one challenge becomes whether languages can be
identified for very short segments.
Due to the nature and characteristics and high overlap across Arabic dialects, rely-
ing on character histograms alone is ineffective (see Section 5.3.1), and more context
is needed. We will explore higher-order letter models as well as word models, and
determine what factors determine which model is best.

Note that the decision process takes into account the prior distribution of the
classes, which is estimated from the training set. The training set is also used to train
probabilistic models to estimate the probability of S given a particular class. We rely
on training n-gram language models to compute such probabilities, and apply Kneser-
Ney smoothing to these probabilities and also use that technique to assign probability
mass to unseen or OOV items (Chen and Goodman 1998). In language model scoring, a
sentence is typically split into words. We will also consider letter-based models, where
the sentence is split into sequences of characters. Note that letter-based models would
be able to take advantage of clues in the sentence that are not complete words, such as
prefixes or suffixes. This would be useful if the amount of training data is very small,
or if we expect a large domain shift between training and testing, in which case content
words indicative of MSA or dialect might not still be valuable in the new domain.
Although our classification method is based only on language model scoring, and
is thus relatively simple, it is nevertheless very effective. Experimental results in Sec-
tion 5.3 (e.g., Figure 10) indicate that this method yields accuracy rates above 85%,
only slightly behind the human accuracy rate of 88.0% reported in Section 4.2.2.

The 83% line has no significance, and is provided to ease comparison with Figure 11.
Rather, they use available MSA-only data and attempt to determine how MSA-like a
sentence is.
The first baseline is based on the assumption that a dialectal sentence would contain
a higher percentage of “non-MSA” words that cannot be found in a large MSA corpus.
To this end, we extracted a vocabulary list from the Arabic Gigaword Corpus, producing
a list of 2.9M word types. Each sentence is given a score that equals the OOV percentage,
and if this percentage exceeds a certain threshold, the sentence is classified as being
dialectal. For each of the cross validation runs in Section 5.3.1, we use the threshold
that yields the optimal accuracy rate on the test set (hence giving this baseline as
much a boost as possible). In our experiments, we found this threshold to be usually
around 10%.
The second approach uses a more fine-grained approach. We train a language model
using MSA-only data, and use it to score a test sentence. Again, if the perplexity exceeds
a certain threshold, the sentence is classified as being dialectal. To take advantage of
domain knowledge, we train this MSA model on the sentences extracted from the article
bodies of the AOC, which corresponds to 43M words of highly relevant content.

would need to estimate (and instead resort to smoothing heavily). The letter-based
models, with a significantly smaller vocabulary size, do not suffer from this problem,
and perform well. This is a double-edged sword though, especially for the trigraph
model, as it means the model is less expressive and converges faster.
Overall though, the experiments show a clear superiority of a supervised method,
be it word- or letter-based, over baselines that use existing MSA-only data. Whichever
model we choose (with the exception of the unigraph model), the obtained accuracy
rates show a significant dominance over the baselines.
It is worth noting that a classification error becomes less likely to occur as the length
of the sentence increases (Figure 12). This is not surprising given prior work on the
language identification problem (ˇReh˚uˇrek and Kolkus 2009; Verma, Lee, and Zakos
2009), which points out that the only “interesting” aspect of the problem is performance
on short segments. The same is true in the case of dialect identification: a short sentence

that contains even a single misleading feature is prone to misclassification, whereas a
long sentence is likely to have other features that help identify the correct class label.15
One could also observe that distinguishing MSA from dialect is a more difficult
task in the Saudi newspaper than in the Jordanian paper, which in turn is harder than
in the Egyptian newspaper. This might be considered evidence that the Gulf dialect
is the closest of the dialects to MSA, and Egyptian is the farthest, in agreement with
the conventional wisdom. Note also that this is not due to the fact that the Saudi
sentences tend to be significantly shorter—the ease of distinguishing Egyptian holds
even at higher sentence lengths, as shown by Figure 12.

on distinguishing MSA from dialect when the news source is known, making it
straightforward to determine which of the Arabic dialects a sentence is written in (once
15 The accuracy curve for the Egyptian newspaper has an outlier for sentence lengths 10–12. Upon
inspection, we found that over 10% of the sentences in that particular length subset were actually
repetitions of a single 12-word sentence. (A disgruntled reader, angry about perceived referee corruption,
essentially bombarded the reader commentary section of several articles with that single sentence.)
This created an artificial overlap between the training and test sets, hence increasing the accuracy
rate beyond what would be reasonably expected due to increased sentence length alone.

the sentence is determined to be dialectal). If the news source is not known, we do not
have the luxury of such a strong prior on the specific Arabic dialect. It is therefore
important to evaluate our approach in a multi-way classifiation scenario, where the
class set is expanded from {MSA, dialect} to {MSA, LEV, GLF, EGY}.
Under this classification set-up, the classification accuracy decreases from 85.7% to
81.0%.16 The drop in performance is not at all surprising, since four-way classification is
inherently more difficult than two-way classification. (Note that the classifier is trained
on exactly the same training data in both scenarios, but with more fine-grained dialectal
labels in the four-way set-up.)
Table 7 is the classifier’s confusion matrix for this four-way set-up, illustrating
when the classifier tends to make mistakes. We note here that most classification errors
on dialectal sentences occur when these sentences are mislabeled as being MSA, not
when they are misidentified as being in some other incorrect dialect. In other words,
dialect→dialect confusion constitutes a smaller proportion of errors than dialect→MSA
confusion. Indeed, if we consider a three-way classification setup on dialectal sentences
alone (LEV vs. GLF vs. EGY), the classifier’s accuracy rate shoots up to 88.4%. This is a
higher accuracy rate than for the general two-way MSA vs. dialect classification (85.7%),
despite involving more classes (three instead of two), and being trained on less data
(0.77M words instead of 1.78M words). This indicates that the dialects deviate from
MSA in various ways, and therefore distinguishing dialects from each other can be done
even more effectively than distinguishing dialect from MSA.
5.3.3 Word and Letter Dialectness. Examining the letter and word distribution in the
corpus provides valuable insight into what features of a sentence are most dialectal.
Let DF(w) denote the dialectness factor of a word w, defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9170445">
def f (w|D) = countD(w)/countD(.) (2)
DF(w) = f(w|MSA) countMSA(w)/countMSA(.)

16 For clarity, we report accuracy rates only for the unigram classifier. The patterns from Section 5.3.1 mostly
hold here as well, in terms of how the different n-gram models perform relative to each other.

where countD(w) (respectively, countMSA(w)) is the number of times w appeared in the
dialectal (respectively, MSA) sentences, and countD(.) is the total number of words in
those sentences. Hence, DF(w) is simply a ratio measuring how much more likely w is to
appear in a dialectal sentence than in an MSA sentence. Note that the dialectness factor
can be easily computed for letters as well, and can be computed for bigrams/bigraphs,
trigrams/trigraphs, and so forth.
Figure 13 lists, for each news source, the word types with the highest and lowest
dialectness factor. The most dialectal words tend to be function words, and they also
tend to be strong indicators of dialect, judging by their very high DF. On the other hand,
the MSA word group contains several content words, relating mainly to politics and
religion.
One must also take into account the actual frequency of a word, as DF only captures
relative frequencies of dialect/MSA, but does not capture how often the word occurs in
the first place. Figure 14 plots both measures for the words of Al-Ghad newspaper. The

when using dialect. Namely, there is closer attention to following hamza rules (distin-
guishing A, ˆA, and Aˇ from each other, rather than mapping them all to A), and better
adherence to (properly) using +h instead of +h at the end of many words. There is also
a higher tendency to use words containing the letters that are most susceptible to being
transformed when pronounced dialectally: ð (usually pronounced as z), D (pronounced
as D), and θ (pronounced as t).
On the topic of spelling variation, one might wonder if nomalizing the Arabic
text before training language models might enhance coverage and therefore improve
performance. For instance, would it help to map all forms of the alef hamza to a single
letter, and all instances of h to h, and so on? Our pilot experiments indicated that such
normalization tends to slightly but consistently hurt performance, so we opted to leave
the Arabic text as is. The only type of preprocessing we performed was more on the
“cleanup” side of things rather than computationally motivated normalization, such as
proper conversion of HTML entities (e.g., &amp;quot; to &amp;quot;) and mapping Eastern Arabic
numerals to their European equivalents.

6. Applying DID to a Large-Scale Arabic Web Crawl
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985391304348">
We conducted a large-scale Web crawl to gather Arabic text from the on-line versions of
newspapers from various Arabic-speaking countries. The first batch contained 319 on-
line Arabic-language newspapers published in 24 countries. This list was compiled from
http://newspapermap.com/ and http://www.onlinenewspapers.com/, which are Web
sites that show the location and language of newspapers published around the world.
The list contained 55 newspapers from Lebanon, 42 from Egypt, 40 from Saudi Arabia,
26 from Yemen, 26 from Iraq, 18 from Kuwait, 17 from Morocco, 15 from Algeria, 12
from Jordan, and 10 from Syria. The data were gathered from July–Sept 2011.
We mirrored the 319 Web sites using wget, resulting in 20 million individual files
and directories. We identified 3,485,241 files that were likely to contain text by selecting
the extensions htm, html, cmff, asp, pdf, rtf, doc, and docx. We converted these files
to text using xpdf’s pdftotext for PDFs and Apple’s textutil for HTML and Doc files.
When concatenated together, the text files contained 438,940,861 lines (3,452,404,197
words). We performed de-duplication to remove identical lines, after which 18,219,348
lines (1,393,010,506 words) remained.
We used the dialect-annotated data to train a language model for each of the four
Arabic varieties (MSA, LEV, GLF, EGY), as described in the previous section. We used these
models to classify the crawled data, assigning a given sentence the label corresponding
to the language model under which that sentence received the highest score. Table 8
gives the resulting label breakdown. We see that the overwhelming majority of the
sentences are classified as MSA, which comes as no surprise, given the prevalence of
MSA in the newspaper genre. Figure 16 shows some sentences that were given non-
MSA labels by our classifier.

Chiang et al. (2006) investigate building a parser for Levantine Arabic, without
using any significant amount of dialectal data. They utilize an available Levantine–MSA
lexicon, but no parses of Levantine sentences. Their work illustrates the difficulty of
adapting MSA resources for use in a dialectal domain.
Zbib et al. (2012) show that incorporating dialect training data into a statistical
machine translation system vastly improves the quality of the translation of dialect
sentences when compared to a system trained solely on an MSA-English parallel cor-
pus. When translating Egyptian and Levantine test sets, a dialect Arabic MT system
outperforms a Modern Standard Arabic MT system trained on a 150 million word
Arabic–English parallel corpus—over 100 times the amount of data as their dialect
parallel corpus.
As far as we can tell, no prior dialect identification work exists that is applied to Ara-
bic text. However, Lei and Hansen (2011) and Biadsy, Hirschberg, and Habash (2009) in-
vestigate Arabic dialect identification in the speech domain. Lei and Hansen (2011) build
Gaussian mixture models to identify the same three dialects we consider, and are able
to achieve an accuracy rate of 71.7% using about 10 hours of speech data for training.
Biadsy, Hirschberg, and Habash (2009) utilize a much larger data set (170 hours of
speech data) and take a phone recognition and language modeling approach (Zissman
1996). In a four-way classification task (with Iraqi as a fourth dialect), they achieve a
78.5% accuracy rate. It must be noted that both works use speech data, and that dialect
identification is done on the speaker level, not the sentence level as we do.

8. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998096">
Social media, like reader commentary on on-line newspapers, is a rich source of dialectal
Arabic that has previously not been studied in detail. We have harvested this type of
resource to create a large data set of informal Arabic that is rich in dialectal content. We
selected a large subset of this data set, and had the sentences in it manually annotated
for dialect. We used the collected labels to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for
dialect identification, and observed interesting linguistic aspects about the task and
annotators’ behavior. Using an approach based on language model scoring, we develop
classifiers that significantly outperform baselines that use large amounts of MSA data,
and we approach the accuracy rates exhibited by human annotators.
In addition to n-gram features, one could imagine benefiting from morphological
features of the Arabic text, by incorporating analyses given by automatic analyzers such
as BAMA (Buckwalter 2004), MAGEAD (Habash and Rambow 2006), ADAM (Salloum
and Habash 2011), or CALIMA (Habash, Eskander, and Hawwari 2012). Although the
difference between our presented approach and human annotators was found to be
relatively small, incorporating additional linguistically motivated features might be
pivotal in bridging that final gap.
In future annotation efforts, we hope to solicit more detailed labels about dialectal
content, such as specific annotation for why a certain sentence is dialectal and not MSA:
Is it due to structural differences, dialectal terms, and so forth? We also hope to expand
beyond the three dialects discussed in this article, by including sources from a larger
number of countries.
Given the recent political unrest in the Middle East (2011), another rich source of
dialectal Arabic are Twitter posts (e.g., with the #Egypt tag) and discussions on various
political Facebook groups. Here again, given the topic at hand and the individualistic
nature of the posts, they are very likely to contain a high degree of dialectal data.

The Arabic transliteration scheme used in the article is the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter
transliteration (HSBT) mapping (Habash, Soudi, and Buckwalter 2007), which extends
the scheme designed by Buckwalter in the 1990s (Buckwalter 2002). Buckwalter’s origi-
nal scheme represents Arabic orthography by designating a single, distinct ASCII char-
acter for each Arabic letter. HSBT uses some non-ASCII characters for better readibility,

consonants. Pharyngealized consonants are “thickened” versions of other, more familiar
consonants, voiced such that the pharynx or epiglottis is constricted during the articula-
tion of the sound. Those consonants are present in very few languages and are therefore
likely to be unfamiliar to most readers, which is why we place them in a separate
section—there is no real distinction in Arabic between them and other consonants.
HSBT also allows for the expression of short vowels and other Arabic diacritics, but
because those diacritics are only rarely expressed in written (and typed) form, we omit
them for brevity.

<abstract confidence="0.9918925625">written form of the Arabic language, Standard Arabic differs in a nontrivial manner from the various spoken regional dialects of Arabic—the true “native languages” of Arabic speakers. Those dialects, in turn, differ quite a bit from each other. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic data sets have predominantly MSA content. In this article, we describe the creation of a novel Arabic resource with dialect annotations. We created a large monolingual data set rich in dialectal Arabic content called the On- Commentary Data set and Callison-Burch 2011). We describe our annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each of more than 100,000 sentences from the data set by crowdsourcing the annotation task, and delve into interesting annotator behaviors (like over-identification of one’s own dialect). Using this new annotated data set, we consider the task of Arabic dialect identification: Given the word sequence forming an Arabic sentence, determine the variety of Arabic in which it is written. We use the data to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for dialect identification, and establish that classifiers using dialectal data significantly and dramatically outperform baselines that use MSA-only data, achieving nearhuman classification accuracy. Finally, we apply our classifiers to discover dialectical data from a large Web crawl consisting of 3.5 million pages mined from on-line Arabic newspapers.</abstract>

Here again, given the topic at hand and the individualistic nature of the posts, they are very likely to contain a high degree of dialectal data. 198 Zaidan and Callison-Burch Arabic Dialect Identification Appendix A The Arabic transliteration scheme used in the article is the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter transliteration (HSBT) mapping (Habash, Soudi, and Buckwalter 2007), which extends the scheme designed by Buckwalter in the 1990s (Buckwalter 2002). Buckwalter’s original scheme represents Arabic orthography by designating a single, distinct ASCII character for each Arabic letter. HSBT uses some non-ASCII characters for better readibility, but maintains the distinct 1-to-1 mapping. Figure 17 lists the character mapping used in HSBT.

We used the collected labels to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for dialect identification, and observed interesting linguistic aspects about the task and annotators’ behavior. Using an approach based on language model scoring, we develop classifiers that significantly outperform baselines that use large amounts of MSA data, and we approach the accuracy rates exhibited by human annotators. In addition to n-gram features, one could imagine benefiting from morphological features of the Arabic text, by incorporating analyses given by automatic analyzers such as BAMA (Buckwalter 2004), MAGEAD (Habash and Rambow 2006), ADAM (Salloum and Habash 2011), or CALIMA (Habash, Eskander, and Hawwari 2012). Although the difference between our presented approach and human annotators was found to be relatively small, incorporating additional linguistically motivated features might be pivotal in bridging that final gap. In future annotation efforts, we hope to solicit more detailed labels about dialectal content, such as specific annotation for why a certain sentence is dialectal and not MSA: Is it due to structural differences, dialectal terms, and so forth?

We discuss how we built a data set of Arabic sentences, each of which is labeled with whether or not it contains dialectal content. The labels include additional details about the level of dialectal content (i.e., how much dialect there is), and of which type of dialect it is. The sentences themselves are sampled from the AOC data set, and we observe that about 40% of sentences contain dialectal content, with that percentage varying between 37% and 48%, depending on the news source. Collecting annotated data for speech and language applications requires careful quality control (Callison-Burch and Dredze 2010). We present the annotation interface and discuss an effective way for quality control that can detect spamming behavior. We then examine the collected data itself, analyzing annotator behavior, measuring agreement among annotators, and identifying interesting biases exhibited by the annotators. In Section 5, we use the collected data to train and evaluate statistical models for several dialect identification tasks. 4.1 Annotation Interface The annotation interface displayed a group of Arabic sentences, randomly selected from the AOC.

This is an indication she might have been having difficulty distinguishing Levantine and Gulf from each other, but that she is familiar with the Egyptian dialect. 5. Automatic Dialect Identification From a computational point of view, we can think of dialect identification as language identification, though with finer-grained distinctions that make it more difficult than typical language ID. Even languages that share a common character set can be distinguished from each other at high accuracy rates using methods as simple as examining character histograms (Cavnar and Trenkle 1994; Dunning 1994; Souter et al. 1994), and, as a largely solved problem, the one challenge becomes whether languages can be identified for very short segments. Due to the nature and characteristics and high overlap across Arabic dialects, relying on character histograms alone is ineffective (see Section 5.3.1), and more context is needed. We will explore higher-order letter models as well as word models, and determine what factors determine which model is best. 5.1 Smoothed n-Gram Models Given a sentence S to classify into one of k classes C1, C2, ... , Ck, we will choose the class with the maxi</context>

The training set is also used to train probabilistic models to estimate the probability of S given a particular class. We rely on training n-gram language models to compute such probabilities, and apply KneserNey smoothing to these probabilities and also use that technique to assign probability mass to unseen or OOV items (Chen and Goodman 1998). In language model scoring, a sentence is typically split into words. We will also consider letter-based models, where the sentence is split into sequences of characters. Note that letter-based models would be able to take advantage of clues in the sentence that are not complete words, such as prefixes or suffixes. This would be useful if the amount of training data is very small, or if we expect a large domain shift between training and testing, in which case content words indicative of MSA or dialect might not still be valuable in the new domain.

This is an indication she might have been having difficulty distinguishing Levantine and Gulf from each other, but that she is familiar with the Egyptian dialect. 5. Automatic Dialect Identification From a computational point of view, we can think of dialect identification as language identification, though with finer-grained distinctions that make it more difficult than typical language ID. Even languages that share a common character set can be distinguished from each other at high accuracy rates using methods as simple as examining character histograms (Cavnar and Trenkle 1994; Dunning 1994; Souter et al. 1994), and, as a largely solved problem, the one challenge becomes whether languages can be identified for very short segments. Due to the nature and characteristics and high overlap across Arabic dialects, relying on character histograms alone is ineffective (see Section 5.3.1), and more context is needed. We will explore higher-order letter models as well as word models, and determine what factors determine which model is best. 5.1 Smoothed n-Gram Models Given a sentence S to classify into one of k classes C1, C2, ... , Ck, we will choose the class with the maximum conditiona</context>

Although there are major differences between Gulf and MSA, Gulf has notably preserved more of MSA’s verb conjugation than other varieties have (Versteegh 2001). 2 There exist resources that describe grammars and dictionaries of many Arabic dialects (e.g., Abdel-Massih, Abdel-Malek, and Badawi 1979; Badawi and Hinds 1986; Cowell 1964; Erwin 1963; Ingham 1994; Holes 2004), but these are compiled by individual linguists as one-off efforts, rather than updated regularly by central regulatory organizations, as is the case with MSA and many other world languages. 3 Arabic speakers writing in dialectal Arabic mostly follow MSA spelling rules in cases where MSA is not strictly phonetic as well (e.g., the pronunciation of the definite article Al). Habash, Diab, and Rambow (2012) have proposed CODA, a Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic, to standardize the spelling of Arabic dialect computational models. 4 Note that such a view is n</context>

Identifying dialectal content can also aid in creating parallel data sets for machine translation, with a dialectal source side. • A user might be interested in content of a specific dialect, or, conversely, in strictly non-dialectal content. This would be particularly relevant in fine-tuning and personalizing search engine results, and could allow for better user-targeted advertising. In the same vein, being able to recognize dialectal content in user-generated text could aid in characterizing communicants and their biographic attributes (Garera and Yarowsky 2009). 180 Zaidan and Callison-Burch Arabic Dialect Identification • In the context of an application such as machine translation (MT), identifying dialectal content could be quite helpful. Most MT systems, when faced with OOV words, either discard the words or make an effort to transliterate them. If a segment is identified as being dialectal first, the MT system might instead attempt to find equivalent MSA words, which are presumably easier to process correctly (e.g., as in Salloum and Habash [2011] and, to some degree, Habash [2008]).

Using an approach based on language model scoring, we develop classifiers that significantly outperform baselines that use large amounts of MSA data, and we approach the accuracy rates exhibited by human annotators. In addition to n-gram features, one could imagine benefiting from morphological features of the Arabic text, by incorporating analyses given by automatic analyzers such as BAMA (Buckwalter 2004), MAGEAD (Habash and Rambow 2006), ADAM (Salloum and Habash 2011), or CALIMA (Habash, Eskander, and Hawwari 2012). Although the difference between our presented approach and human annotators was found to be relatively small, incorporating additional linguistically motivated features might be pivotal in bridging that final gap. In future annotation efforts, we hope to solicit more detailed labels about dialectal content, such as specific annotation for why a certain sentence is dialectal and not MSA: Is it due to structural differences, dialectal terms, and so forth?

We see that the overwhelming majority of the sentences are classified as MSA, which comes as no surprise, given the prevalence of MSA in the newspaper genre. Figure 16 shows some sentences that were given nonMSA labels by our classifier. 7. Related Work Habash et al.

When translating Egyptian and Levantine test sets, a dialect Arabic MT system outperforms a Modern Standard Arabic MT system trained on a 150 million word Arabic–English parallel corpus—over 100 times the amount of data as their dialect parallel corpus. As far as we can tell, no prior dialect identification work exists that is applied to Arabic text. However, Lei and Hansen (2011) and Biadsy, Hirschberg, and Habash (2009) investigate Arabic dialect identification in the speech domain. Lei and Hansen (2011) build Gaussian mixture models to identify the same three dialects we consider, and are able to achieve an accuracy rate of 71.7% using about 10 hours of speech data for training. Biadsy, Hirschberg, and Habash (2009) utilize a much larger data set (170 hours of speech data) and take a phone recognition and language modeling approach (Zissman 1996).

There are a large number of linguistic differences between MSA and the regional dialects. Some of those differences do not appear in written form if they are on the level of short vowels, which are omitted in Arabic text anyway. That said, many differences manifest themselves textually as well: • MSA’s morphology is richer than dialects’ along some dimensions such as case and mood. For instance, MSA has a dual form in addition to the singular and plural forms, whereas the dialects mostly lack the dual form. Also, MSA has two plural forms, one masculine and one feminine, whereas many (though </context>

Using an approach based on language model scoring, we develop classifiers that significantly outperform baselines that use large amounts of MSA data, and we approach the accuracy rates exhibited by human annotators. In addition to n-gram features, one could imagine benefiting from morphological features of the Arabic text, by incorporating analyses given by automatic analyzers such as BAMA (Buckwalter 2004), MAGEAD (Habash and Rambow 2006), ADAM (Salloum and Habash 2011), or CALIMA (Habash, Eskander, and Hawwari 2012). Although the difference between our presented approach and human annotators was found to be relatively small, incorporating additional linguistically motivated features might be pivotal in bridging that final gap. In future annotation efforts, we hope to solicit more detailed labels about dialectal content, such as specific annotation for why a certain sentence is dialectal and not MSA: Is it due to structural differences, dialectal terms, and so forth?

See the lower part of Table 1 for some conjugations of the root ˇs-r-b (to drink). This list, and Table 1, deal with differences that are expressed at the inidividualword level. It is important to note that Arabic varieties differ markedly in style and sentence composition as well. For instance, all varieties of Arabic, MSA, and otherwise, allow both SVO and VSO word orders, but MSA has a higher incidence of VSO sentences than dialects do (Aoun, Benmamoun, and Sportiche 1994; Shlonsky 1997). 2.2 Existing Arabic Data Sources Despite the fact that speakers are usually less comfortable communicating in MSA than in their own dialect, MSA content significantly dominates dialectal content, as MSA is the variant of choice for formal and official communication. Relatively little printed material exists in local dialects, such as folkloric literature and some modern poetry, but the vast majority of published Arabic is in MSA. As a result, MSA’s dominance is also apparent in data sets available for linguistic research. The problem is somewhat mitigated in the speech domain, since dialecta</context>

Automatic Dialect Identification From a computational point of view, we can think of dialect identification as language identification, though with finer-grained distinctions that make it more difficult than typical language ID. Even languages that share a common character set can be distinguished from each other at high accuracy rates using methods as simple as examining character histograms (Cavnar and Trenkle 1994; Dunning 1994; Souter et al. 1994), and, as a largely solved problem, the one challenge becomes whether languages can be identified for very short segments. Due to the nature and characteristics and high overlap across Arabic dialects, relying on character histograms alone is ineffective (see Section 5.3.1), and more context is needed. We will explore higher-order letter models as well as word models, and determine what factors determine which model is best. 5.1 Smoothed n-Gram Models Given a sentence S to classify into one of k classes C1, C2, ... , Ck, we will choose the class with the maximum conditional probability: C∗ = a</context>

Although there are major differences between Gulf and MSA, Gulf has notably preserved more of MSA’s verb conjugation than other varieties have (Versteegh 2001). 2 There exist resources that describe grammars and dictionaries of many Arabic dialects (e.g., Abdel-Massih, Abdel-Malek, and Badawi 1979; Badawi and Hinds 1986; Cowell 1964; Erwin 1963; Ingham 1994; Holes 2004), but these are compiled by individual linguists as one-off efforts, rather than updated regularly by central regulatory organizations, as is the case with MSA and many other world languages. 3 Arabic speakers writing in dialectal Arabic mostly follow MSA spelling rules in cases where MSA is not strictly phonetic as well (e.g., the pronunciation of the definite article Al).

Those dialects, in turn, differ quite a bit from each other. However, due to MSA’s prevalence in written form, almost all Arabic data sets have predominantly MSA content. In this article, we describe the creation of a novel Arabic resource with dialect annotations. We have created a large monolingual data set rich in dialectal Arabic content called the Arabic Online Commentary Data set (Zaidan and Callison-Burch 2011). We describe our annotation effort to identify the dialect level (and dialect itself) in each of more than 100,000 sentences from the data set by crowdsourcing the annotation task, and delve into interesting annotator behaviors (like over-identification of one’s own dialect). Using this new annotated data set, we consider the task of Arabic dialect identification: Given the word sequence forming an Arabic sentence, determine the variety of Arabic in which it is written. We use the data to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for dialect identification, and establish that classifiers using</context>

They utilize an available Levantine–MSA lexicon, but no parses of Levantine sentences. Their work illustrates the difficulty of adapting MSA resources for use in a dialectal domain. Zbib et al.

When translating Egyptian and Levantine test sets, a dialect Arabic MT system outperforms a Modern Standard Arabic MT system trained on a 150 million word Arabic–English parallel corpus—over 100 times the amount of data as their dialect parallel corpus.

As far as we can tell, no prior dialect identification work exists that is applied to Arabic text. However, Lei and Hansen (2011) and Biadsy, Hirschberg, and Habash (2009) investigate Arabic dialect identification in the speech domain. Lei and Hansen (2011) build Gaussian mixture models to identify the same three dialects we consider, and are able to achieve an accuracy rate of 71.7% using about 10 hours of speech data for training. Biadsy, Hirschberg, and Habash (2009) utilize a much larger data set (170 hours of speech data) and take a phone recognition and language modeling approach (Zissman 1996). In a four-way classification task (with Iraqi as a fourth dialect), they achieve a 78.5% accuracy rate. It must be noted that both works use speech data, and that dialect identification is done on the speaker level, not the sentence level as we do. 8. Conclusion Social media, like reader commentary on on-line newspapers, is a rich source of dialectal Arabic that has previously not been studied in detail. We have harvested this type of resource to create a large data set of informal Arabic that is rich in dialectal content.

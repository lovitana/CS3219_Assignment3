Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.97396">
Language Technology and Computational Linguistics research innovations in recent years have given
us a great deal of modern language processing tools and resources for many languages. Basic language
tools like spell and grammar checkers through to interactive systems like Siri, as well as resources like
the Trillion Word Corpus, all fit together to produce products and services which enhance our daily lives.
Until relatively recently, languages with smaller numbers of speakers have largely not benefited from
attention in this field. However, modern techniques in the field are making it easier to create language
tools and resources from fewer resources in a faster time. In this light, many lesser spoken languages are
making their way into the digital age through the provision of language technologies and resources.
The Celtic Language Technology Workshop (CLTW) series of workshops provides a forum for
researchers interested in developing NLP (Natural Language Processing) resources and technologies
for Celtic languages. As Celtic languages are under-resourced, our goal is to encourage collaboration
and communication between researchers working on language technologies and resources for Celtic
languages.
Welcome to the First Celtic Language Technology Workshop. We received 15 submissions, and after a
rigorous review process, accepted 12 papers. Eight of which will be presented as oral presentations and
4 of which will be presented at the poster session.

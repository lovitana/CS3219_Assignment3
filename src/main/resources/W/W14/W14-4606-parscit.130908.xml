<bodyText confidence="0.999766625">
We present a study of cross-lingual direct transfer parsing for the Irish language. Firstly we
discuss mapping of the annotation scheme of the Irish Dependency Treebank to a universal de-
pendency scheme. We explain our dependency label mapping choices and the structural changes
required in the Irish Dependency Treebank. We then experiment with the universally annotated
treebanks of ten languages from four language family groups to assess which languages are the
most useful for cross-lingual parsing of Irish by using these treebanks to train delexicalised pars-
ing models which are then applied to sentences from the Irish Dependency Treebank. The best
results are achieved when using Indonesian, a language from the Austronesian language family.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999945846153846">
Considerable efforts have been made over the past decade to develop natural language processing re-
sources for the Irish language (U´ı Dhonnchadha et al., 2003; U´ı Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006;
U´ı Dhonnchadha, 2009; Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013). One such resource
is the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a) which contains just over 1000 gold standard de-
pendency parse trees. These trees are labelled with deep syntactic information, marking grammatical
roles such as subject, object, modifier, and coordinator. While a valuable resource, the treebank does not
compare in size to similar resources of other languages.1 The small size of the treebank affects the accu-
racy of any statistical parsing models learned from this treebank. Therefore, we would like to investigate
whether training data from other languages can be successfully utilised to improve Irish parsing.
Cross-lingual transfer parsing involves training a parser on one language, and parsing data of another
language. McDonald et al. (2011) describe two types of cross-lingual parsing, direct transfer parsing in
which a delexicalised version of the source language treebank is used to train a parsing model which
is then used to parse the target language, and a more complicated projected transfer approach in which
the direct transfer approach is used to seed a parsing model which is then trained to obey source-target
constraints learned from a parallel corpus. These experiments revealed that languages that were typo-
logically similar were not necessarily the best source-target pairs, sometimes due to variations between
their language-specific annotation schemes. In more recent work, however, McDonald et al. (2013) re-
ported improved results on cross-lingual direct transfer parsing using a universal annotation scheme, to
which six chosen treebanks are mapped for uniformity purposes. Underlying the experiments with this
new annotation scheme is the universal part-of-speech (POS) tagset designed by Petrov et al. (2012).
While their results confirm that parsers trained on data from languages in the same language group (e.g.
Romance and Germanic) show the most accurate results, they also show that training data taken across
language-groups also produces promising results. We attempt to apply the direct transfer approach with
Irish as the target language.
The Irish language belongs to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European language family. The natural
first step in cross-lingual parsing for Irish would be to look to those languages of the Celtic language

these languages are just as, if not further, under-resourced. Thus, we attempt to use the languages of the
universal dependency treebanks (McDonald et al., 2013).
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the status of the Irish lan-
guage and the Irish Dependency Treebank. Section 3 describes the mapping of the Irish Dependency
Treebank’s POS tagset (UiDhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006) to that of Petrov et al. (2012), and
the Irish Dependency Treebank annotation scheme (Lynn et al. (2012b)) to the Universal Dependency
Scheme. Following that, in Section 4 we carry out cross-lingual direct transfer parsing experiments with
ten harmonised treebanks to assess whether any of these languages are suitable for such parsing transfer
for Irish. Section 5 summarises our work.

Irish, a minority EU language, is the national and official language of Ireland. Despite this status, Irish
is only spoken on a daily basis by a minority. As a Celtic language, Irish shares specific linguistic
features with other Celtic languages, such as a VSO (verb-subject-object) word order and interesting
morphological features such as inflected prepositions and initial mutations, for example.
Compared to other EU-official languages, Irish language technology is under-resourced, as highlighted
by a recent study (Judge et al., 2012). In the area of morpho-syntactic processing, recent years have seen
the development of a part-of-speech tagger (UiDhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006), a morphological
analyser (UiDhonnchadha et al., 2003), a shallow chunker (UiDhonnchadha, 2009), a dependency tree-
bank (Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b) and statistical dependency parsing models for MaltParser
(Nivre et al., 2006) and Mate parser (Bohnet, 2010) trained on this treebank (Lynn et al., 2013).
The annotation scheme for the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012b) was inspired by Lexical
Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001) and has its roots in the dependency annotation scheme described
by C¸etino˘glu et al. (2010). It was extended and adapted to suit the linguistic characterisics of the Irish
language. The final label set consists of 47 dependency labels, defining grammatical and functional
relations between the words in a sentence. The label set is hierarchical in nature with labels such as
vparticle (verb particle) and vocparticle (vocative particle), for example, representing more
fine-grained versions of the particle label.

3 A universal dependency scheme for the Irish Dependency Treebank

In this section, we describe how a “universal” version of the Irish Dependency Treebank was created by
mapping the original POS tags to universal POS tags and mapping the original dependency scheme to the
universal dependency scheme. The result of this effort is an alternative version of the Irish Dependency
Treebank which will be made available to the research community along with the original.

3.1 Mapping the Irish POS tagset to the Universal POS tagset
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995251214285714">
The Universal POS tagset (Petrov et al., 2012) has been designed to facilitate unsupervised and cross-
lingual part-of-speech tagging and parsing research, by simplifying POS tagsets and unifying them across
languages. The Irish Dependency Treebank was built upon a POS-tagged corpus developed by UiDhon-
nchadha and van Genabith (2006). The treebank’s tagset contains both coarse- and fine-grained POS tags
which we map to the Universal POS tags (e.g. Prop Noun → NOUN). Table 1 shows the mappings.
Most of the POS mappings made from the Irish POS tagset to the universal tagset are intuitive. How-
ever, some decisions require explanation.
Cop → VERB There are two verbs ‘to be’ in Irish: the substantive verb b´ı and the copula is. For
that reason, the Irish POS tagset differentiates the copula by using the POS tag Cop. In Irish syntax
literature, there is some discussion over its syntactic role, whether it is a verb or a linking particle. The
role normally played is that of a linking element between a subject and a predicate. However, Lynn et al.
(2012a)’s syntactic analysis of the copula is in line with that of Stenson (1981), regarding it as a verb. In
addition, because the copula is often labelled in the Irish annotation scheme as the syntactic head of the
matrix clause, we have chosen VERB as the most suitable mapping for this part of speech.

Pron Prep → ADP Pron Prep is the Irish POS tag for pronominal prepositions, which are also referred
to as prepositional pronouns. Characteristic of Celtic languages, they are prepositions inflected with their
pronominal objects – compare, for example, le mo chara ‘with my friend’ with leis ‘with him’. While
the Irish POS labelling scheme labels them as pronouns in the first instance, our dependency labelling
scheme treats the relationship between them and their syntactic heads as obl (obliques) or padjunct
(prepositional adjuncts). Therefore, we map them to ADP (adpositions).

3.2 Mapping the Irish Dependency Scheme to the Universal Dependency Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976066666667">
The departure point for the design of the Universal Dependency Annotation Scheme (McDonald et
al., 2013) was the Stanford typed dependency scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), which was
adapted based on a cross-lingual analysis of six languages: English, French, German, Korean, Spanish
and Swedish. Existing English and Swedish treebanks were automatically mapped to the new universal
scheme. The rest of the treebanks were developed manually to ensure consistency in annotation. The
study also reports some structural changes (e.g. Swedish treebank coordination structures). 2
There are 41 dependency relation labels to choose from in the universal annotation scheme3. McDon-
ald et al. (2013) use all labels in the annotation of the German and English treebanks. The remaining
languages use varying subsets of the label set. In our study we map the Irish dependency annotation
scheme to 30 of the universal labels. The mappings are given in Table 2.
As with the POS mapping discussed in Section 3.1, mapping the Irish dependency scheme to the
universal scheme was relatively straightforward, due in part, perhaps, to a similar level of granularity
suggested by the similar label set sizes (Irish 47; standard universal 41). That said, there were significant
considerations made in the mapping process, which involved some structural change in the treebank and
the introduction of more specific analyses in the labelling scheme. These are discussed below.

subordinate clauses In the original Irish Dependency Treebank, the link between a matrix clause and
its subordinate clause is similar to that of LFG: the subordinating conjunction (e.g. mar ‘because’, nuair
‘when’) is a subadjunct dependent of the matrix verb, and the head of the subordinate clause is a
comp dependent of the subordinating conjunction (Figure 3). In contrast, the universal scheme is in
line with the Stanford analysis of subordinate clauses, where the head of the clause is dependent on the
matrix verb, and the subordinating conjunction is a dependent of the clause head (Figure 4).

ppred, subj q, obj q, advadjunct q, obl, obl2. In producing the universal version of the tree-
bank, these Irish-specific dependency types are mapped to less informative universal ones (see Table 2).
Conversely, we found that the universal scheme makes distinctions that the Irish scheme does not. Some
of these dependency types are not needed for Irish. For example, there is no indirect object iobj in Irish,
nor is there a passive construction that would require nsubjpass, csubjpass or auxpass. Also, in
the Irish Dependency Treebank, the copula is usually the root (top) or the head of a subordinate clause
(e.g. comp) which renders the universal type cop redundant. Others that are not used are adp, expl,
infmod, mwe, neg, partmod. However, we did identify some dependency relationships in the univer-
sal scheme that we introduce to the universal Irish Dependency Treebank (adpcomp, adposition,
advcl, num, parataxis). These are explained below.
comp → adpcomp, advcl, parataxis, ccomp The following new mappings were previously subsumed
by the Irish dependency label comp (complement clause). The mapping for comp has thus been split
between adpcomp, advcl, parataxis and ccomp.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964956083333333">
• adpcomp is a clausal complement of an adposition. An example from the English data is “some
understanding of what the company’s long-term horizon should begin to look like”, where ‘begin’,
as the head of the clause, is a dependent of the preposition ‘of’. An example of how we use this
label in Irish is: an line l´antosach is m´o cl´u a th´ainig as Ciarraio´ bhiaimsir Sheehy ann ‘the most
renowned forward line to come out of Kerry since Sheehy’s time’ (lit. ‘from it was Sheehy’s time’).
The verb bhi‘was’, head of the dependent clause, is an adcomp dependent of the preposition ´o.
• advcl is used to identify adverbial clause modifiers. In the English data, they are often introduced
by subordinating conjunctions such as ‘when’, ‘because’, ‘although’, ‘after’, ‘however’, etc. An
example is “However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered, ad rates will be
higher”. Here, ‘lowered’ is a advcl dependent of ‘will’. An example of usage is: T´a truailli´u m´or
san ´ait mar nach bhfuil c´oras s´earachais ann ‘There is a lot of pollution in the area because there
is no sewerage system’, where bhfuil ‘is’ is an advcl dependent of T´a ‘is’.
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.945031">

<listItem confidence="0.998803666666667">
• parataxis labels clausal structures that are separated from the previous clause with punctuation
such as – ... : () ; and so on. Examples in Irish Is l´eir go bhfuil ag ´eirile feachtas an IDA –
meastar gur in ´Eirinn a lonnaitear timpeall 30% de na hionaid ‘It is clear that the IDA campaign is
succeeding – it is believed that 30% of the centres are based in Ireland’. Here, meastar ‘is believed’
is a parataxis dependent of Is ‘is’.
• ccomp covers all other types of clausal complements. For example, in English, ‘Mr. Amos says the
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.92613875">
Show-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day’. The head of the complement clause
here is ‘do’, which is a comp dependent of the matrix verb ‘says’. A similar Irish example is: D´uirt
siad nach bhfeiceann siad an cine´al seo chomh minic ‘They said that they don’t see this type as
often’. Here, bhfeiceann ‘see’ is the head of the complement clause, which is a comp dependent of
the verb D´uirt ‘Said’.
quant → num, advmod The Irish Dependency Scheme uses one dependency label (quant) to cover
all types of numerals and quantifiers. We now use the universal scheme to differentiate between quanti-
fiers such as m´or´an ‘many’ and numerals such as fiche ‘twenty’.
nadjunct → nmod, compmod The Irish dependency label nadjunct accounts for all nominal mod-
ifiers. However, in order to map to the universal scheme, we discriminate two kinds: (i) nouns that mod-
ify nouns (usually genitive case in Irish) are mapped to compmod (e.g. plean margaiochta ‘marketing
plan’) and (ii) nouns that modify clauses are mapped to nmod (e.g. bliain o´ shin ‘a year ago’).

language for all our parsing experiments.
Universal Irish Dependency Treebank This is the universal version of the Irish Dependency Treebank
which contains 1020 gold-standard trees, which have been mapped to the Universal POS tagset and
Universal Dependency Annotation Scheme, as described in Section 3. In order to establish a monolingual
baseline against which to compare our cross-lingual results, we perform a five-fold cross-validation by
dividing the full data set into five non-overlapping training/test sets. We also test our cross-lingual models
on an delexicalised version of this treebank.
Transfer source training data For our direct transfer cross-lingual parsing experiments, we use 10 of
the standard version harmonised training data sets4 made available by McDonald et al. (2013): Brazilian
Portuguese (PT-BR), English (EN), French (FR), German (DE), Indonesian (ID), Italian (IT), Japanese
(JA), Korean (KO), Spanish (ES) and Swedish (SV). For the purposes of uniformity, we select the first
4447 trees from each treebank – to match the number of trees in the smallest data set (Swedish). We
delexicalise all treebanks and use the universal POS tags as both the coarse- and fine-grained values.5
We train a parser on all 10 source data sets outlined and use each induced parsing model to parse and test
on a delexicalised version of the Universal Irish Dependency Treebank.
Largest transfer source training data - Universal English Dependency Treebank English has the
largest source training data set (sections 2-21 of the Wall Street Journal data in the Penn Treebank (Mar-
cus et al., 1993) contains 39, 832 trees). As with the smaller transfer datasets, we delexicalise this dataset
and use the universal POS tag values only. We experiment with this larger training set in order to establish
whether more training data helps in a cross-lingual setting.

A closer look at the single-source transfer parsing evaluation results (SingleT) shows that some lan-
guage sources are particularly strong for parsing accuracy of certain labels. For example, ROOT (for
Indonesian), adpobj (for French) and amod (for Spanish). In response to these varied results, we ex-
plore the possibility of combining the strengths of all the source languages (multi-source direct transfer
(MultiT) – also implemented by McDonald et al. (2011)). A parser is trained on a concatenation of
all the delexicalised source data described in Section 4.1 and tested on the full delexicalised Universal
Irish Dependency Treebank. Combining all source data produces parsing results of 57.69% (UAS) and
41.38% (LAS), which is outperformed by the best individual source language model.
Parsing with the large English training set (LargestT) yielded results of 51.59 (UAS) and 33.97 (LAS)
compared to a UAS/LAS of 51.72/35.05 for the smaller English training set. We investigated more
closely why the larger training set did not improve performance by incrementally adding training sen-
tences to the smaller set – none of these increments reveal any higher scores, suggesting that English is
not a suitable source training language for Irish.
It is well known that sentence length has a negative effect on parsing accuracy. As noted in earlier
experiments (Lynn et al., 2012b), the Irish Dependency Treebank contains some very long difficult-to-
parse sentences (some legal text exceeds 300 tokens in length). The average sentence length is 27 tokens.
By placing a 30-token limit on the Universal Irish Dependency Treebank we are left with 778 sentences,
with an average sentence length of 14. We use this new 30-token-limit version of the Irish Dependency
Treebank data to test our parsing models. The results are shown in the lower half of Table 3. Not
surprisingly, the results rise substantially for all models.

McDonald et al. (2013)’s single-source transfer parsing results show that languages within the same
language groups make good source-target pairs. They also show reasonable accuracy of source-target
pairing across language groups. For instance, the baseline when parsing French is 81.44 (UAS) and 73.37
(LAS), while the transfer results obtained using an English treebank are 70.14 (UAS) and 58.20(LAS).
Our baseline parser for Irish yields results of 78.54 (UAS) and 71.59 (LAS), while Indonesian-Irish
transfer results are 61.69 (UAS) and 43.88 (LAS).
The lowest scoring source language is Japanese. This parsing model’s output shows less than 3%
accuracy when identifying the ROOT label. This suggests the effect that the divergent word orders have

on this type of cross-lingual parsing – VSO (Irish) vs SOV (Japanese). Another factor that is likely to be
playing a role is the size of the Japanese sentences. The average sentence length in the Japanese training
data is only 9 words, which means that this dataset is comparatively smaller than the others. It is also
worth noting that the universal Japanese treebank uses only 15 of the 41 universal labels (the universal
Irish treebank uses 30 of these labels).
As our best performing model (Indonesian) is an Austronesian language, we investigate why this
language does better when compared to Indo-European languages. We compare the results obtained by
the Indonesian parser with those of the English parser (SingleT). Firstly, we note that the Indonesian
parser captures nominal modification much better than English, resulting in an increased precision-recall
score of 60/67 on compmod. This highlights that the similarities in noun-noun modification between
Irish and Indonesian helps cross-lingual parsing. In both languages the modifying noun directly follows
the head noun, e.g. ‘the statue of the hero’ translates in Irish as dealbh an laoich (lit. statue the hero);
in Indonesian as patung palawan (lit. statue hero). Secondly, our analysis shows that the English parser
does not capture long-distance dependencies as well as the Indonesian parser. For example, we have
observed an increased difference in precision-recall of 44%-44% on mark, 12%-17.88% on cc and
4%-23.17% on rcmod when training on Indonesian. Similar differences have also been observed when
we compare with the French and English (LargestT) parsers. The Irish language allows for the use
of multiple conjoined structures within a sentence and it appears that long-distance dependencies can
affect cross-lingual parsing. Indeed, excluding very long sentences from the test set reveals substantial
increases in precision-recall scores for labels such as advcl, cc, conj and ccomp – all of which are
labels associated with long-distance dependencies.
With this study, we had hoped that we would be able to identify a way to bootstrap the development
of the Irish Dependency Treebank and parser through the use of delexicalised treebanks annotated with
the Universal Annotation Scheme. While the current treebank data might capture certain linguistic phe-
nomena well, we expected that some cross-linguistic regularities could be taken advantage of. Although
the best cross-lingual model failed to outperform the monolingual model, perhaps it might be possible to
combine the strengths of the Indonesian and Irish treebanks? We performed 5-fold cross-validation on
the combined Indonesian and Irish data sets. The results did not improve over the Irish model. We then
analysed the extent of their complementarity by counting the number of sentences where the Indonesian
model outperformed the Irish model. This happened in only 20 cases, suggesting that there is no benefit
in using the Indonesian data over the Irish data nor in combining them at the sentence-level.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996">
In this paper, we have reported an implementation of cross-lingual direct transfer parsing of the Irish
language. We have also presented and explained our mapping of the Irish Dependency Treebank to the
Universal POS tagset and Universal Annotation Scheme. Our parsing results show that an Austronesian
language surpasses Indo-European languages as source data for cross-lingual Irish parsing.
In extending this research, there are many interesting avenues which could be explored including
the use of Irish as a source language for another Celtic language and experimenting with the projected
transfer approach of McDonald et al. (2011).

The best results are achieved when using Indonesian, a language from the Austronesian language family. 1 Introduction Considerable efforts have been made over the past decade to develop natural language processing resources for the Irish language (U´ı Dhonnchadha et al., 2003; U´ı Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006; U´ı Dhonnchadha, 2009; Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013). One such resource is the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a) which contains just over 1000 gold standard dependency parse trees. These trees are labelled with deep syntactic information, marking grammatical roles such as subject, object, modifier, and coordinator. While a valuable resource, the treebank does not compare in size to similar resources of other languages.1 The small size of the treebank affects the accuracy of any statistical parsing models learned from this treebank. Therefore, we would like to investigate whether training dat</context>

However, these languages are just as, if not further, under-resourced. Thus, we attempt to use the languages of the universal dependency treebanks (McDonald et al., 2013). The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the status of the Irish language and the Irish Dependency Treebank. Section 3 describes the mapping of the Irish Dependency Treebank’s POS tagset (UiDhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006) to that of Petrov et al. (2012), and the Irish Dependency Treebank annotation scheme (Lynn et al. (2012b)) to the Universal Dependency Scheme. Following that, in Section 4 we carry out cross-lingual direct transfer parsing experiments with ten harmonised treebanks to assess whether any of these languages are suitable for such parsing transfer for Irish. Section 5 summarises our work. 2 Irish Language and Treebank Irish, a minority EU language, is the national and official language of Ireland.

In the area of morpho-syntactic processing, recent years have seen the development of a part-of-speech tagger (UiDhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006), a morphological analyser (UiDhonnchadha et al., 2003), a shallow chunker (UiDhonnchadha, 2009), a dependency treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b) and statistical dependency parsing models for MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006) and Mate parser (Bohnet, 2010) trained on this treebank (Lynn et al., 2013). The annotation scheme for the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012b) was inspired by Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001) and has its roots in the dependency annotation scheme described by C¸etino˘glu et al. (2010). It was extended and adapted to suit the linguistic characterisics of the Irish language. The final label set consists of 47 dependency labels, defining grammatical and functional relations between the words in a sentence.

Most of the POS mappings made from the Irish POS tagset to the universal tagset are intuitive. However, some decisions require explanation. Cop → VERB There are two verbs ‘to be’ in Irish: the substantive verb b´ı and the copula is. For that reason, the Irish POS tagset differentiates the copula by using the POS tag Cop. In Irish syntax literature, there is some discussion over its syntactic role, whether it is a verb or a linking particle. The role normally played is that of a linking element between a subject and a predicate. However, Lynn et al. (2012a)’s syntactic analysis of the copula is in line with that of Stenson (1981), regarding it as a verb. In addition, because the copula is often labelled in the Irish annotation scheme as the syntactic head of the matrix clause, we have chosen VERB as the most suitable mapping for this part of speech. 42 Part-of-speech (POS) mappings Universal Irish Universal Irish NOUN Noun Noun, Pron Ref, ADP Prep Deg, Prep Det, Prep Pron, Subst Subst, Verbal Noun, Prep Simp, Prep Poss, Prop Noun Prep CmpdNoGen, Prep Cmpd, Prep Art, Pron Prep PRON Pron Pers, Pron Idf, Pron Q, ADV Adv Temp, Adv Loc, Adv Dir, Pr</context>

Parsing with the large English training set (LargestT) yielded results of 51.59 (UAS) and 33.97 (LAS) compared to a UAS/LAS of 51.72/35.05 for the smaller English training set. We investigated more closely why the larger training set did not improve performance by incrementally adding training sentences to the smaller set – none of these increments reveal any higher scores, suggesting that English is not a suitable source training language for Irish. It is well known that sentence length has a negative effect on parsing accuracy. As noted in earlier experiments (Lynn et al., 2012b), the Irish Dependency Treebank contains some very long difficult-toparse sentences (some legal text exceeds 300 tokens in length). The average sentence length is 27 tokens. By placing a 30-token limit on the Universal Irish Dependency Treebank we are left with 778 sentences, with an average sentence length of 14. We use this new 30-token-limit version of the Irish Dependency Treebank data to test our parsing models. The results are shown in the lower half of Table 3. Not surprisingly, the results rise substantially for all models. 4.3 Discussion McDonald et al. (2013)’s single-source transf</context>

The best results are achieved when using Indonesian, a language from the Austronesian language family. 1 Introduction Considerable efforts have been made over the past decade to develop natural language processing resources for the Irish language (U´ı Dhonnchadha et al., 2003; U´ı Dhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006; U´ı Dhonnchadha, 2009; Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b; Lynn et al., 2013). One such resource is the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a) which contains just over 1000 gold standard dependency parse trees. These trees are labelled with deep syntactic information, marking grammatical roles such as subject, object, modifier, and coordinator. While a valuable resource, the treebank does not compare in size to similar resources of other languages.1 The small size of the treebank affects the accuracy of any statistical parsing models learned from this treebank.

Compared to other EU-official languages, Irish language technology is under-resourced, as highlighted by a recent study (Judge et al., 2012). In the area of morpho-syntactic processing, recent years have seen the development of a part-of-speech tagger (UiDhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006), a morphological analyser (UiDhonnchadha et al., 2003), a shallow chunker (UiDhonnchadha, 2009), a dependency treebank (Lynn et al., 2012a; Lynn et al., 2012b) and statistical dependency parsing models for MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006) and Mate parser (Bohnet, 2010) trained on this treebank (Lynn et al., 2013). The annotation scheme for the Irish Dependency Treebank (Lynn et al., 2012b) was inspired by Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001) and has its roots in the dependency annotation scheme described by C¸etino˘glu et al. (2010). It was extended and adapted to suit the linguistic characterisics of the Irish language. The final label set consists of 47 dependency labels, defining grammatical and functional relations between the words in a sentence.

Therefore, we would like to investigate whether training data from other languages can be successfully utilised to improve Irish parsing. Cross-lingual transfer parsing involves training a parser on one language, and parsing data of another language. McDonald et al. (2011) describe two types of cross-lingual parsing, direct transfer parsing in which a delexicalised version of the source language treebank is used to train a parsing model which is then used to parse the target language, and a more complicated projected transfer approach in which the direct transfer approach is used to seed a parsing model which is then trained to obey source-target constraints learned from a parallel corpus.

For example, ROOT (for Indonesian), adpobj (for French) and amod (for Spanish). In response to these varied results, we explore the possibility of combining the strengths of all the source languages (multi-source direct transfer (MultiT) – also implemented by McDonald et al. (2011)). A parser is trained on a concatenation of all the delexicalised source data described in Section 4.1 and tested on the full delexicalised Universal Irish Dependency Treebank. Combining all source data produces parsing results of 57.69% (UAS) and 41.38% (LAS), which is outperformed by the best individual source language model. Parsing with the large English training set (LargestT) yielded results of 51.59 (UAS) and 33.97 (LAS) compared to a UAS/LAS of 51.72/35.05 for the smaller English training set.

These experiments revealed that languages that were typologically similar were not necessarily the best source-target pairs, sometimes due to variations between their language-specific annotation schemes. In more recent work, however, McDonald et al. (2013) reported improved results on cross-lingual direct transfer parsing using a universal annotation scheme, to which six chosen treebanks are mapped for uniformity purposes. Underlying the experiments with this new annotation scheme is the universal part-of-speech (POS) tagset designed by Petrov et al. (2012). While their results confirm that parsers trained on data from languages in the same language group (e.g. Romance and Germanic) show the most accurate results, they also show that training data taken across language-groups also produces promising results.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we give an overview of the status of the Irish language and the Irish Dependency Treebank. Section 3 describes the mapping of the Irish Dependency Treebank’s POS tagset (UiDhonnchadha and van Genabith, 2006) to that of Petrov et al. (2012), and the Irish Dependency Treebank annotation scheme (Lynn et al. (2012b)) to the Universal Dependency Scheme. Following that, in Section 4 we carry out cross-lingual direct transfer parsing experiments with ten harmonised treebanks to assess whether any of these languages are suitable for such parsing transfer for Irish. Section 5 summarises our work. 2 Irish Language and Treebank Irish, a minority EU language, is the national and official language of Ireland.

The result of this effort is an alternative version of the Irish Dependency Treebank which will be made available to the research community along with the original. 3.1 Mapping the Irish POS tagset to the Universal POS tagset The Universal POS tagset (Petrov et al., 2012) has been designed to facilitate unsupervised and crosslingual part-of-speech tagging and parsing research, by simplifying POS tagsets and unifying them across languages. The Irish Dependency Treebank was built upon a POS-tagged corpus developed by UiDhonnchadha and van Genabith (2006). The treebank’s tagset contains both coarse- and fine-grained POS tags which we map to the Universal POS tags (e.g. Prop Noun → NOUN). Table 1 shows the mappings. Most of the POS mappings made from the Irish POS tagset to the universal tagset are intuitive. However, some decisions require explanation. Cop → VERB</context>

However, some decisions require explanation. Cop → VERB There are two verbs ‘to be’ in Irish: the substantive verb b´ı and the copula is. For that reason, the Irish POS tagset differentiates the copula by using the POS tag Cop. In Irish syntax literature, there is some discussion over its syntactic role, whether it is a verb or a linking particle. The role normally played is that of a linking element between a subject and a predicate. However, Lynn et al. (2012a)’s syntactic analysis of the copula is in line with that of Stenson (1981), regarding it as a verb. In addition, because the copula is often labelled in the Irish annotation scheme as the syntactic head of the matrix clause, we have chosen VERB as the most suitable mapping for this part of speech. 42 Part-of-speech (POS) mappings Universal Irish Universal Irish NOUN Noun Noun, Pron Ref, ADP Prep Deg, Prep Det, Prep Pron, Subst Subst, Verbal Noun, Prep Simp, Prep Poss, Prop Noun Prep CmpdNoGen, Prep Cmpd, Prep Art, Pron Prep PRON Pron Pers, Pron Idf, Pron Q, ADV Adv Temp, Adv Loc, Adv Dir, Pron Dem Adv Q, Adv Its, Adv Gn VERB Cop Cop, Verb PastInd, Verb PresInd, PRT </context>

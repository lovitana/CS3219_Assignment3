<bodyText confidence="0.997963166666667">
In this paper we present Biografix, a pattern based tool that simplifies parenthetical structures with
biographical information, whose aim is to create simple, readable and accessible sentences. To
that end, we analysed the parenthetical structures that appear in the first paragraph of the Basque
Wikipedia, and concentrated on biographies. Although it has been designed and developed for
Basque we adapted it and evaluated with other five languages. We also perform an extrinsic
evaluation with a question generation system to see if Biografix improve its results.

1 Introduction and motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9804575">
Parentheticals are expressions, somehow structurally independent, that integrated in a text function as
modifiers of phrases, sentences..., and add information or comments to the text. Therefore, it has been
argued that they interrupt the prosodic flow, breaking the intonation. According to Deh´e and Kavalova
(2007), parentheticals can be realised in different ways: one-word parentheticals, sentence adverbials,
comment clauses and reporting verbs, nominal apposition and non-restrictive relative clauses, question
tags, clauses and backtracking. Besides, the authors argue that sometimes the parentheticals are not
related to the host sentence neither semantically nor pragmatically, but they are understood in the text
due to the situational context.
Some parentheticals can be the result of a stylistic choice (Blakemore, 2006) and that is the case of par-
enthetical information found in the first paragraph of some Wikipedia articles. As stated in the Wikipedia
guidelines1 the first paragraph of the articles should contain resuming and important information. That
is why the information is there so condensed. Apart from condensing the information parentheticals
cause long sentences, which are more difficult to process both for humans and for advanced applications.
Moreover, web writting style books (Amatria et al., 2013) suggest not to use parenthetical constructs be-
cause they make more difficult the access to the information. Simple wikipedia guidelines2 recommend
also not to use two sets of brackets next to each other.
NLP applications such as question generation systems (QG) for educational domain3 may fail when
finding important information in brackets. For example, if we want to create questions, systems such
as the presented in Aldabe et al. (2013) will look for a verb4. In the case of parenthetical biographical
information there is no verb which makes explicit when the person is born or when she or he died. So,
no question will be created based on that information.
The study of parentheticals in Basque has been limited to the analysis of the irony in the narrativity
of Koldo Mitxelena (Azpeitia, 2011). In the present study we analyse the parentheticals that are used
in the first paragraph of the Basque Wikipedia and developed a rule-based tool Biografix to detect these

structures and to create new sentences out of them. To be more concrete, we concentrate on biographical
information since there are not explicit words in text that give a clue about what type of information it is.
Our aim is to make more readable sentences and, consequently, to eliminate the interruption they cause.
About the domain of biographies, their automatic generation has been studied (Duboue et al., 2003) in
Natural Language Generation (NLG). In this research line, referring expressions to people have been
studied for automatic summarisation of news (Siddharthan et al., 2011). The quality of the biographies
(linguistic and content) has been recently analysed in the English Wikipedia (Flekova et al., 2014).
We want also to make a first step towards the simplification of Basque Wikipedia, since English sim-
ple wikipedia has been a great resource for Text Simplification (TS) and Readability Assessement (RA).
Efforts for simple wikipedia have also been made for Portuguese (Junior et al., 2011) using TS tech-
niques. Although Biografix has been specially developed for Basque, being pattern-based, we have also
evaluated its adaptation to other languages. This work is not limited to wikipedia, Biografix can be used
on other types of text as well, since these structures can be found in educational texts, newspapers and
so on.
This paper is structured as follows: after this introduction we report in section 2 the treatment of
parentheticals in TS and in Wikipedia. In section 3 we describe Biografix and in section 4 we report its
evaluation. Finally, we conclude and outline the future work in section 5.

2 Parenthetical Structures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907888888889">
In this section we report the treatment that parenthentical structures have undergone in TS and other NLP
applications. We also describe the parentheticals found in Basque Wikipedia.
Parentheticals have been object of study in TS and three main operations have been proposed: a)
parentheticals have been removed out of the texts (Drndarevi´c et al., 2013), b) parentheticals have been
removed but they have been kept in another form (Aranzabe et al., 2012; Seretan, 2012) or c) paren-
theticals have been added to explain the meaning by short paraphrases (Hallett and Hardcastle, 2008) or
hyperonyms (Leroy et al., 2013). In any case, it is usually recommended to avoid them (Aluisio et al.,
2008). In other NLP applications such as summarisation they are usually removed and even some QG
works follow the same strategy, in case they are not relevant (Heilman and Smith, 2010).

2.1 Parenthetical Structures in Basque Wikipedia
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997562222222222">
Wikipedia guidelines emphasise the importance of the first paragraph. It should indeed contain a sum-
mary of the most significant information. To concentrate all the information, stylistic resources such as
parenthentical structures are used. The information that is written in brackets in the Basque Wikipedia
can be classified in two groups: a) information about people and b) information about concepts. About
people biographical data and mandates are usually found and about concepts the etymology of words is
frequent. Translations or transliterations of the named entity or the concept is found for both groups.
On the other hand, there are other frequent parenthetical structures that are found in the first paragraph,
but they are not written in brackets. This is the case of the nicknames, which are written in commas. This
kind of information is also found in other languages. After this analysis, we decided to concentrate on
biographical data to create new sentences out of that information.
Biographical data Contrary to English Wikipedia, in Basque Wikipedia the information contained in
bracket is, if known, birthplace (town, province, state), date of birth, and if the person is dead, date of
death and place of dead. This is the case as well of the Catalan, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, German
and French Wikipedia among others, although sometimes paraphrases are found in brackets. For French
there is, for example, more than a way to write the biographical data5.
In Basque Wikipedia guidelines6 it is stated that biographical data should be written as in examples 1
and 2. If the person is dead, we see in example 1 that the birth data (town, state and date) and the death
data (town, state and date) are linked by a dash.

’Karlos Argi˜nano Urkiola, internationally known with the Karlos Argui˜nano spelling, (Beasain,
Gipuzkoa, 6th September, 1948) is a basque chef, actor and businessman.’
In both cases, the places (if known) should precede the date and these should be separated by commas.
However, biographical data is not frequently written uniformly. Places do not precede the date, the date
is incomplete (only year) and sometimes other characters like the question mark appear to denote that
the place or the date is known.
Taking into account this guidelines and the articles we have analysed, we have developed Biografix, a
pattern based tool that detects biographical data and creates new sentences with this information. This
tool was originally developed for Basque but it has been adapted to other languages. An adaptation
of this tool, moreover, could be used as a first step into Text Summarisation, if we only remove the
parentheticals and do not create new sentences.
Biographical information is contained in brackets in other Wikipedias as well but formats may be
different. The way of writing, for example, in Catalan, German and Portuguese is similar to Basque. In
Spanish, French, and Italian that format is also used but, as mentioned beforehand, other formats are also
accepted.

<bodyText confidence="0.988915333333333">
Biografix is a pattern-based tool that simplifies the biographical data and creates new sentences out of that
information. Having as an input the example 1 in subsection 2.1, Biografix will produce the sentences 3,
4, 5, 6 and 7.

So, if the person is dead, Biografix will write first the main sentence (3) followed by a new sentence (4)
with the information about the birth. If the birthplace is composed by more than a place entity, sentences
like (5) will be written. After the birth information, a sentence will contain the information about the
death (6). For the cases that more than a place appear, those will be rewritten (7).
If the person is alive like in example 2 in subsection 2.1, the same process will take place, but no death
information will appear by creating the new sentences 8, 9 and 10.

So, first, main information will be kept (8) and then the information about the birth will appear (9). As
a second place information (the province) original sentence (2), it will be rewritten as well (10).
We have to mention that we use the title of the article as the subject of the sentences containing the
biographical information. That is way we see that in sentences 9 and 10 the subject is Karlos Argi˜nano
and the subject in sentence 8 is Karlos Argi˜nano Urkiola. We took this decision for cases where the
real name of person is not so known, e.g. Cherilyn Sarkisian. Had we used Cherilyn Sarkisian in all the
sentences, would someone have known we are talking about Cher?
To carry out these simplifying transformations Biografix follows the simplification process explained
in Aranzabe et al. (2012):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99496315">
• Splitting: In this stage we get the parts of the sentences we are going to work with. To that end,
three steps take place: a) the parenthetical structure is removed from the original sentence; b) the
type of parenthetical expression is checked looking at whether there are birth and death data or only
the former; c) dates and places are split. We use simple patterns to detect the dates and the places.
As it is possible to find more than a place, they will be split by the commas. This stage is common
for all the languages.
• Reconstruction: The new simplified sentences are created in this stage. This part is language-
dependent, since we add the verbs, determinants, prepositions and case markers. In the case of
Basque we also remove the absolutive case that is found in some articles7. Anyway, we create three
kind of sentences that are common for all the languages with the constructs obtained in the splitting
stage: a) sentences indicating birth data, b) sentences indicating death data and c) sentences indicat-
ing place specifications. The main sentence will be kept as in the original version (the parenthetical
has been removed in the splitting stage).
• Reordering: The sentences will be ordered in text. First, the main sentence; second, the information
about the birth; if there is more than a place, the following sentences will contain that information
(place specifications); third, the information about the death (if dead) and finally, the death place
specifications.
• Correction: The aim of this stage is to check if there are any mistake in the new sentences and to
correct them. As one of our goals is to know the correctness of Biografix’s output this stage has not
been implemented yet.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999681727272727">
Biografix has been designed for Basque and then the reconstruction stage has been adapted to other 7
languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese. To develop the Basque
version we implemented the guidelines in Wikipedia (see subsection 2.1) and we used a small corpus
of 50 sentences to find possible cases, where the guidelines are not fulfilled. These 50 sentences were
randomly crawled.
For other languages, we did not make any change in the splitting stage but for German. According
to German Wikipedia guidelines birth and death data are separated by a semicolon and not by a dash.
Although French, Spanish and Italian have other options to express the biographical information between
bracket we did not implement them. Our aim is not to create a tool specially for these languages, but to
see if the design for Basque can be applicable to other languages. That is why, the adaptations to other
languages are available at our website8, if someone wants to improve them.

Other improvements could be done in the reconstruction stage. To rewrite the sentences we have used
the most familiar past tense in each language. The only exception was French. The most familiar past
tense according to the context is the pass´e compos´e but this tense requires the agreement of the gender
between subject and verb9. As the pass´e simple is not very familiar we decided to use the present tense
to avoid the concordance problem. So, this could be one of the things to take into account for future
developers.
No other changes should be done in the reordering stage but the correction has to be adapted to each
language. No training was performed for the other languages. Only 3-5 sentences were used to check
that there were no errors.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984625">
In order to evaluate Biografix we crawled the first sentence of 30 Wikipedia articles. The method to
select these articles was the following: a) we used CatScan V2.0β10 to get a list of the Biographies in
Basque Wikipedia; b) we randomised that list and make another list to see which articles were written
in 8 languages (Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish); c) we
selected the first 32 articles. The first two articles were used to explain and train the annotators. The final
test-sample had, therefore, 30 items.
Having that sample, we performed two evaluations: a manual evaluation (section 4.1) and a extrinsic
evaluation with a question generation system (section 4.2).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995284">
4.1 Manual evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9981824375">
The manual evaluation was carried out for 6 languages: Basque, Catalan, French, Galician, German
and Spanish. 10 linguists took part in the evaluation process and they evaluated three aspects of the
task: the original sentences (JatTestua), Biografix performance (Prog) and the grammaticality of the new
simplified sentences (Gram). In total they answered nine yes/no questions. This evaluation method we
are proposing is useful to perform an error analysis and find out which are the weak points of our tool.
To evaluate the performance and the adaptation of Biografix we chose six languages according to the
format of the biographical data: i) Basque (the language Biografix has been designed for) ii) Catalan
(same format as Basque), iii) German (same format but a slightly variation), iv) Spanish (same format as
Basque but other options as well), v) French (same format as Basque in one of the parenthetical formats
and other options), vi) Galician (without defined format). Portuguese and Italian were not evaluated be-
cause their case studies were already evaluated with Catalan and Spanish. All the sample were evaluated
by two annotators except for Catalan and Galician, because Catalan has the same case study as Basque
and Galician has not a predefined format that could cause confusion.
Questions concerning the original sentences (JatTestua) Three questions were presented in regards
to the original sentence in Wikipedia. The aim is to know if the original sentences do have parenthetical
structures and therefore, how many of them are candidates to simplification (coverage).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999174666666667">

2. Is the sentence grammatically correct and standard?

<bodyText confidence="0.992819333333333">
We asked about the grammaticality and the punctuation of original sentences (correctness) because it

performance of the question generators and the correctness of the created questions.

Second and third questions are essential to know if at rewriting in the reconstruction stage no informa-

other kind of information like translations have been added and treated as biographical or if a sentence
referring to the death of a living person has been created.
Questions concerning the grammaticality of the new simplified sentences (Gram) Two questions
were prepared to check the correctness of the simplified questions, since to create correct sentences is
very important to understand the text. These questions should be answered for each simplified sentence
(grammatical precision).

In table 1 we present the results obtained in the manual evaluation and it shows the results considering
the following measures:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986467625">
1. The coverage is the percentages out of 30 (the size of the sample) Biografix processed, that is, the
sentences that had parentheticals.
2. The correctness is the percentage of the source sentences whose grammar and punctuation is correct.
3. The recall is the division between the number of the created simple sentences and the number of the
sentences it should have created taking into account all the information in the original sentences.
4. The precision is the division between the correct performed, that is, all the Prog questions have been
correctly answered and the processed sentences. We call this precision at performance.
5. The grammatical precision is the correctly created sentences among the created sentences.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999445">
In the second-last column we show the κ agreement of the evaluators (Cohen, 1960). As we have few
examples, the expected agreement is very high and it causes low scores. That is the reason why we also
show the percentage agreement (observed agreement) in the last column.
Taking a look at the results for Basque, we see that Biografix is able to create almost all the sentences
(recall: 0.94) and that they are correct (grammatical precision: 0.87), although there are little problems
keeping all the information and keeping it right (precision: 0.79). Taking into account that the percentage
of the correct source sentences is low (82.76), we follow Aldabe et al. (2013) and recalculate the results
without the incorrect sentences. This way, recall is 0.93, precision is 0.80, grammatical precision is
0.88. As we see, results do not vary that much, since the grammaticality of the source sentence has
only influence in the first of the created sentences. About the agreement between annotators, we see that
κ is really low (0.37) due to the few disagreements that annotators had above all about the grammar.
However, the observed agreement is high (90.63).

<bodyText confidence="0.999981179487179">
In the case of Catalan, we see that Biografix is not able to create as many sentences as information in
the original source (recall: 0.77) and this tendency occurs in the other languages as well. Precision at
performance goes down (0.53) due to added and lost information but grammatical precision is acceptable
(0.78). We think, that this is a quite satisfactory adaptation.
The results for French indicate that something went wrong. There is more than a way to express the
biographical information and, as expected, the performance goes down. The precision is very low (0.18)
due to the fact that a lot of information is lost and as sometime paraphrases do appear in the original
sentence, this fact implies grammatical error. Anyhow, the recall is acceptable (0.80) and that is a good
starting point for the further development of French version. The average of the obtained K measures
is really low (0.39) and that is why having few instances Cohen’s kappa penalises the disagreement too
much.
The case of Galician is quite different. It is not stated in the guidelines how biographical data should
be written and the parentheticals we found are few (coverage: 43.00) and different from the Basque.
However, we wanted to try Biografix and what we see is, that, although its precision at performance is
really low (0.15), the created sentences are quite correct (0.62). We think the Galician Wikipedia should
be analysed thoroughly and then Biografix should be adjusted.
The German version of Biografix was able to simplify all the sentences found in the test-sample and
its recall is high (0.88). Its weak point is the precision at performance (0.60), as in other languages, due
to the fact that the second question of Prog is not satisfied. The sentence it creates are quite acceptable
(0.71) as well. Surprisingly, both linguists agreed in all the cases and questions. So, we conclude that
the German adaptation was successful.
Finally, in the case of the Spanish adaptation, we see that the precision is very low (0.33) since there
was an important information loss. However, the grammatical precision (0.67) is acceptable. Although
K is higher (0.52) than in other languages, observed agreement is not far from Basque (88.76). It is
remarkable as well that being Spanish a long time normalised language only the 85.00 % of the source
sentence are correct and that although there are other formats to express the biographical information the
coverage is absolute (100.00).
The main disagreement was found when evaluating the grammar and the punctuation due to different
criteria of the annotators. For some of them sentences without verb were correct because they considered
that there was an elided verb. In our opinion, as we are trying to simplify, we think that all the sentences
should have a finite verb. Annotators did not have to much trouble to answer the four Prog questions,
so we think that this is a good methodology, and, moreover, it makes easy to perform error analysis. We
want to point out that K has not been the best measure but we have used it as we consider that it is a
standard to measure data reliability.
To conclude, we find that there is room to improve the versions in other languages, above all trying not
to lose information but the adaptation of Biografix has been a good starting point. In fact, the adaptation
has been quite satisfactory for German and Catalan, because they share the format with Basque but they
should be further analysed. As foreseen, the languages with different formats like Galician, Spanish and
French require a bigger analysis.

4.2 Extrinsic evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997625">
To evaluate the performance of Biografix throughout another NLP advanced application, we used the web
application Seneko (Lopez-Gazpio and Maritxalar, 2013)11, the application of the chunk-based question
generation system for educational purposes presented in Aldabe et al. (2013). This kind of evaluation
was only performed for Basque.
We ran Seneko with the original sentences and the simplified sentences. The number of the generated
questions is presented in table 2. We break down the results on the basis of the case markers as well.
In agglutinative languages like Basque case markers are the morphemes that express the grammatical
functions.

Table 2: Questions generated by Seneko using the original and the simplified sentences
</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.998326818181818">
Using as input the original sentences Seneko is able to create 34 questions, more or less a question
per sentence. 23 of them have been generated for the absolutive case, that is, for the subject and the
predicative, and only 7 of them have been generated for the inessive. Taking into account that we are
working with biographical information, this is a bad result because the inessive case in Basque is used
to express time and place relations. That is, the inessive is used to create questions with the question
words When and Where. On the other hand, using as source the simplified sentences, 65 questions have
been generated for the absolutive and 66 for the inessive. This way, we see that using Biografix’s output
Seneko has been able to generate questions about place and time expressions.
Next, in 11 and 12 we show an example of the questions generated by Seneko. In 11 we find that using
the original input it was only able to create a question, and it makes no sense but using the simplified text
(example 12) Seneko creates two correct questions.

designed and developed for Basque, we have applied it to the parenthetical biographical information
written in other seven languages: French, German, Spanish, Catalan, Galician, Italian and Portuguese.
The results of the evaluation show that the Basque version obtains very good results but the adaptations
should be further developed. Anyway, good results have been obtained for Catalan and German and
promising for Spanish and French. Besides, we have shown its validity through an extrinsic evaluation
with Seneko, a question generation system. These systems are important for the educational domain,
and the improvement Biografix offers is considerable. Although we have used Wikipedia to develop and
evaluate Biografix, it can be used for other kind of text with parenthetical biographical information.
For the future, we plan to continue analysing and implementing rules for other kind of parenthetical
structures like etymology, translations of named entities or mandates of relevant people. We also plan
to link the entities to the their articles in Wikipedia to offer additional information. Patterns could also
be improved using previously developed analysers or tools, but this way the splitting stage will become
language-dependent. Moreover, we cannot forget that this work is included in the main framework of
the TS system for Basque that we are developing and this is another step towards the main aim of getting
easier and more readable Basque texts.

Moreover, web writting style books (Amatria et al., 2013) suggest not to use parenthetical constructs because they make more difficult the access to the information. Simple wikipedia guidelines2 recommend also not to use two sets of brackets next to each other. NLP applications such as question generation systems (QG) for educational domain3 may fail when finding important information in brackets. For example, if we want to create questions, systems such as the presented in Aldabe et al. (2013) will look for a verb4. In the case of parenthetical biographical information there is no verb which makes explicit when the person is born or when she or he died. So, no question will be created based on that information. The study of parentheticals in Basque has been limited to the analysis of the irony in the narrativity of Koldo Mitxelena (Azpeitia, 2011).

Questions concerning the original sentences (JatTestua) Three questions were presented in regards to the original sentence in Wikipedia. The aim is to know if the original sentences do have parenthetical structures and therefore, how many of them are candidates to simplification (coverage). 1. Are there parenthetical structures written between brackets? 2. Is the sentence grammatically correct and standard? 3. Is the punctuation correct? We asked about the grammaticality and the punctuation of original sentences (correctness) because it was shown in Aldabe et al. (2013) that many source sentences were incorrect and that fact decreased the performance of the question generators and the correctness of the created questions. 9e.g. Cher est n´ee en Californie., but Ernest Rutherford est n´eø en Angleterre. 10http://tools.wmflabs.org/catscan2/catscan2.php (last accessed: March, 2014) 15 Questions concerning the performance of Biografix (Prog) Four questions were designed to check if Biografix carries out the process it has been implemented for (precision). 1. Have parenthetical structures been removed? 2. Is all the information kept? 3. Taking into account the or</context>

As we have few examples, the expected agreement is very high and it causes low scores. That is the reason why we also show the percentage agreement (observed agreement) in the last column. Taking a look at the results for Basque, we see that Biografix is able to create almost all the sentences (recall: 0.94) and that they are correct (grammatical precision: 0.87), although there are little problems keeping all the information and keeping it right (precision: 0.79). Taking into account that the percentage of the correct source sentences is low (82.76), we follow Aldabe et al. (2013) and recalculate the results without the incorrect sentences. This way, recall is 0.93, precision is 0.80, grammatical precision is 0.88. As we see, results do not vary that much, since the grammaticality of the source sentence has only influence in the first of the created sentences. About the agreement between annotators, we see that κ is really low (0.37) due to the few disagreements that annotators had above all about the grammar. However, the observed agreement is high (90.63). 16 Language Coverage Correctness Recall Precision Gram. Prec. K % Basque 97.00 82.76 0.94 0.79 0.87 0.37 90.63 C</context>

According to Deh´e and Kavalova (2007), parentheticals can be realised in different ways: one-word parentheticals, sentence adverbials, comment clauses and reporting verbs, nominal apposition and non-restrictive relative clauses, question tags, clauses and backtracking. Besides, the authors argue that sometimes the parentheticals are not related to the host sentence neither semantically nor pragmatically, but they are understood in the text due to the situational context. Some parentheticals can be the result of a stylistic choice (Blakemore, 2006) and that is the case of parenthetical information found in the first paragraph of some Wikipedia articles. As stated in the Wikipedia guidelines1 the first paragraph of the articles should contain resuming and important information. That is why the information is there so condensed. Apart from condensing the information parentheticals cause long sentences, which are more difficult to process both for humans and for advanced applications. Moreover, web writting style books (Amatria et al., 2013) suggest not to use parenthetical constructs because they make more difficult the access to the info</context>

The recall is the division between the number of the created simple sentences and the number of the sentences it should have created taking into account all the information in the original sentences. 4. The precision is the division between the correct performed, that is, all the Prog questions have been correctly answered and the processed sentences. We call this precision at performance. 5. The grammatical precision is the correctly created sentences among the created sentences. In the second-last column we show the κ agreement of the evaluators (Cohen, 1960). As we have few examples, the expected agreement is very high and it causes low scores. That is the reason why we also show the percentage agreement (observed agreement) in the last column. Taking a look at the results for Basque, we see that Biografix is able to create almost all the sentences (recall: 0.94) and that they are correct (grammatical precision: 0.87), although there are little problems keeping all the information and keeping it right (precision: 0.79).

In fact, the adaptation has been quite satisfactory for German and Catalan, because they share the format with Basque but they should be further analysed. As foreseen, the languages with different formats like Galician, Spanish and French require a bigger analysis. 17 4.2 Extrinsic evaluation To evaluate the performance of Biografix throughout another NLP advanced application, we used the web application Seneko (Lopez-Gazpio and Maritxalar, 2013)11, the application of the chunk-based question generation system for educational purposes presented in Aldabe et al. (2013). This kind of evaluation was only performed for Basque. We ran Seneko with the original sentences and the simplified sentences. The number of the generated questions is presented in table 2. We break down the results on the basis of the case markers as well. In agglutinative languages like Basque case markers are the morphemes that express the grammatical functions.

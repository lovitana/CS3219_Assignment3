The present study aims to investigate the
application of prosodic speech features in a
psychological intervention based on life-
review. Several studies have shown that
speech features can be used as indicators of
depression severity, but these studies are
mainly based on controlled speech recording
tasks instead of natural conversations. The
present exploratory study investigated speech
features as indicators of depression in con-
versations of a therapeutic intervention. The
changes in the prosodic speech features pitch,
duration of pauses, and total duration of the
participant’s speaking time were studied over
four sessions of a life-review intervention for
three older participants. The ecological valid-
ity of the dynamics observed for prosodic
speech features could not be established in
the present study. The changes in speech fea-
tures differed from what can be expected in
an intervention that is effective in decreasing
depression and were inconsistent with each
other for each of the participants. We suggest
future research to investigate changes within
the intervention sessions, to relate the chang-
es in feature values to the topical content of
the speech, and to relate the speech features
directly to depression scores.

period of at least two weeks (American Psychia-
tric Association, 2000). Depression disorders are
the leading cause of disability and contribute
largely to the burden of disease in middle- and
high-income countries worldwide (Üstun et al.,
2004). In 2012, more than 350 million people
around the world suffered from depression symp-
toms (World Health Organization, 2012). To de-
crease the onset of depression disorders, early
psychological interventions, i.e., psychological
methods targeting behavioral change to reduce
limitations or problems (Vingerhoets, Kop, &amp;
Soons, 2002), aiming at adults with depression
symptoms or mild depression disorders are
necessary. Meta-analytic findings show that psy-
chological interventions reduce the incidence of
depression disorders by 22%, indicating that pre-
vention of new cases of depression disorders is
indeed possible (Cuijpers et al., 2008).
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions
for depression and changes during the interven-
tions, reliable and valid measures of depression
severity are necessary. Depression severity is
mostly measured by self-report questionnaires
such as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), the
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D;
Hamilton, 1960), and the Beck Depression In-
ventory (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996). These
self-report questionnaires often include items on
mood and feelings. Moreover, questionnaire
items may cover physical depression symptoms
such as sleep disturbances, changes in weight

and appetite, and loss in energy. However, in
some target groups such as older adults these
items can confound with health problems and
physical diseases, which increase in old age. For
these reasons, there is a need for valid and objec-
tive measures of depression severity. Not only to
assess depression severity before and after thera-
py, but also to detect the dynamics during the
therapy (Elliot, 2010).

1.1 Computational linguistics, speech ana-
lysis, and mental health care
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965430379747">
It is commonly assumed and confirmed in
several studies that emotions and mood can in-
fluence the speaking behavior of a person and the
characteristics of the sound in speech (Kuny &amp;
Stassen, 1993; Scherer, Johnstone, &amp; Klasmeyer,
2003). Already in 1954, Moses concluded that
the voice and speech patterns of psychiatric pa-
tients differed from those of people without a
psychiatric diagnosis. Clinicians observe the
speech of depressed patients frequently as uni-
form, monotonous, slow, and with a low voice
(Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993). A review by Sobin and
Sackeim (1997) showed that depressed people
differ from normal and other psychiatric groups
on psychomotor symptoms such as speech. The
speech of depressed patients is characterized by a
longer pause duration, that is, an increased
amount of time between speech utterances as
well as by a reduced variability in mean vocal
pitch.
More recently these insights have led to
collaborative and multidisciplinary work be-
tween researchers from the fields of computa-
tional linguistics and mental health care. With
the growing availability of models and algo-
rithms for automated natural language processing
that can be put to use in clinical scenarios, de-
pression can now increasingly be measured
based on the characteristics of the language used
by patients, such as the frequency of verbal ele-
ments in a narrative that express a certain mood
or sentiment (Pennebaker &amp; Chung, 2011), and
acoustic speech features. Because vocal acoustic
features such as pause durations and pitch are
biologically based, it has even been argued that
they can serve as biomarkers of depression se-
verity (Mundt et al., 2012). As a consequence,
speech features such as pitch and pause durations
can be used to estimate the severity of a depres-
sion.
To date, several studies investigated the validi-
ty of several speech features as indicators of de-
pression. Indeed, the speech features pitch and
speech loudness correlate significantly with
global depression scores during recovery (Kuny
&amp; Stassen, 1993; Stassen, Kuny, &amp; Hell, 1998).
After recovery from depression, the speech pause
time of depressed adults was no longer elongated
(Hardy et al., 1984). These results indicate that
prosodic speech features are valid measures of
depression.
However, these studies have the limitation that
the speech analyses are based on the recording of
controlled speech based on tasks such as count-
ing and reading out loud. Such speech recording
tasks take place under ideal voice recording con-
ditions (Cannizzaro, Harel, Reilly, Chappell, &amp;
Snyder, 2004), while speech analysis is more
difficult when conducted outside a controlled
setting, because of so-called noisy channel
effects (Janssen, Tacke, de Vries, van den Broek,
Westerink, Haselager, &amp; IJsselsteijn, 2013).
Moreover, controlled speech tasks are cognitive-
ly less demanding than free speech tasks (Alpert
et al., 2011). This evokes the question whether
speech features are also ecological valid, i.e.,
whether they can be used as indicators of depres-
sion severity, when measured during natural
conversations instead of during the recording of
controlled speech tasks (Bronfenbrenner, 1977).
A study on speech samples from video recor-
dings of structured interviews revealed promis-
ing results: speaking rate and pitch variation, but
not the percentage of pauses, showed a large cor-
relation with depression rating scores (Canni-
zaro, Harel, Reilly, Chappell, &amp; Snyder, 2004).
Additional studies on the ecological validity of
using prosodic speech features as indicator for
depression are necessary.

1.2 Speech features as mood markers in a

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978125">
In the present study the speech of older adults
will be measured in four sessions of a psycholo-
gical intervention, combining knowledge in the
fields of computational linguistics and psycho-
logical interventions in mental health care. Be-
cause psychological interventions of depression
have shown to be effective (e.g., Cuijpers, van
Straten, &amp; Smit, 2006) and are broadly imple-
mented in mental health care, the measurement
of speech features in psychological interventions
is a promising application for the field of compu-
tational linguistics. For example, speech features
can be used to provide direct feedback to both
the therapist and patient on the severity and
changes in severity of depression during the psy-
chological intervention. Clinicians do not have

the ability to differentiate precisely the duration
of for example the patient’s utterances and paus-
es (Alpert et al. 2001). There is also ample evi-
dence that text mining techniques based on the
frequency of certain terms can be applied to nar-
ratives from patients in order to monitor changes
in mood (Pennebaker &amp; Chung, 2011), and a re-
cent study has shown that machines can better
recognize certain emotions than lay people
(Janssen et al., 2013), underlining once again the
added value of automated speech analysis. To
pave the way for future applications that would
enable the use of speech features as a direct
feedback mechanism, the first step is to gain
more knowledge on the patterns in speech fea-
tures and on how changes in these features can
be considered as meaningful signals of patterns
in psychological interventions.
The psychological intervention in the present
study is based on life-review: the structured re-
collection of autobiographical memories. De-
pressed people have difficulties in retrieving spe-
cific, positive memories. Their autobiographical
memory is characterized by more negative and
general memories (e.g., Williams et al., 2007),
for example memories that reflect a period or
recurrent event (e.g., the period of a marriage)
rather than a specific event (e.g., the ceremony
on the wedding day). The present life-review
course targets the recollection of specific, posi-
tive memories in older adults with depression
symptoms. In four weekly sessions, the inter-
viewer stimulates the recollection by asking
questions on the depressed person’s childhood,
adolescence, adulthood and life in general. An
advantage of life-review in comparison to other
therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,
is that it fits in with a natural activity of older
adults to recollect memories and tell stories
about their lives (Bluck &amp; Levine, 1998). Life-
review has shown to be an effective method to
decrease depression symptoms (Korte, Bohl-
meijer, Cappeliez, Smit, &amp; Westerhof, 2012;
Pinquart &amp; Forstmeier, 2012) and is considered
an evidence-based intervention for depression in
older adults (Scogin, Welsh, Hanson, Stump, &amp;
Coates, 2005).
Our study is one of the first to investigate pro-
sodic speech features during a psychological in-
tervention. The study is exploratory and aims to
gain insight into the ecological validity of pro-
sodic speech features in a psychological life-
review intervention. The life-review intervention
offers the opportunity to investigate the prosodic
speech features over time. Life-review is highly
suitable to investigate speech features during an
intervention, since the speech from the recall of
autobiographical memories provides strong pro-
sodic speech changes (Cohen, Hong, &amp; Guevara,
2010) and the expression of emotions charac-
terized by speech characteristics is stronger after
open and meaning-questions as compared to
closed and fact-questions (Truong, Westerhof,
Lamers, &amp; de Jong, under review). Our paper is a
first step to gain insight into the methods that are
necessary to evaluate the application of prosodic
speech features in mental health care. In the pre-
sent study into the role of prosodic speech fea-
tures, vocal pitch and pause duration will be in-
vestigated in three participants across all four
weekly sessions. Because the life-review inter-
vention is effective in decreasing depression
symptoms (Korte et al., 2011; Serrano, Latorre,
Gatz, &amp; Montanes, 2004), we expect that the
prosodic features change accordingly. Therefore,
we hypothesize (a) an increase in average vocal
pitch, (b) an increase in the variation in vocal
pitch, (c) a decrease in average pause duration,
(d) a decrease in the ratio between the total pause
time and total speech time (pause speech ratio),
and (e) an increase in the ratio between the par-
ticipant’s speech and total duration of the session
(speech total duration ratio) during the interven-
tion.

The life-review intervention ‘Precious memories’
(Bohlmeijer, Serrano, Cuijpers, &amp; Steunenberg,
2007) targets the recollection of specific, positive
memories. The intervention is developed for
older adults with depression symptoms living in
a nursing home. Each of the four weekly sessions
focuses on a different theme: childhood, ado-
lescence, adulthood, and life in general. The ses-
sions are individual and guided by a trained in-
terviewer. The sessions take place at the partici-
pant’s home and last approximately 45 minutes.
Each of the sessions is structured by fourteen
main questions that stimulate the participant to
recollect and tell specific positive memories

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900428571429">
Participants with depression symptoms were re-
cruited in nursing homes in the area of Amster-
dam, the Netherlands. Participation in the life-
review intervention was voluntary. Three partici-
pants were selected for whom audio recordings
of the four sessions were available, which resul-
ted in a dataset of twelve life-review sessions.
The three participants (below labeled as P1, P3
and P5) were females with an age between 83
and 90 years. The educational background varied
from low to high and the marital status from
married to never married. The participants signed
an informed consent form for the use of the au-
dio-tapes for scientific purposes.

2.3 Data preparation and analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999775">
All acoustic features were automatically extract-
ed with Praat (Boersma, 2001). Because the
speech of both the interviewer and the partici-
pants were recorded on one mixed audio channel,
some manual interventions had to be applied in
order to determine the segments in which the
participant is talking. First, for each session, the
segments in which the participant is the main
speaker were selected. These so-called ‘turns’
were then labeled in more detail; utterances pro-
duced by the interviewer were marked and dis-
carded in the speech analysis. For each turn,
mean pitch, standard deviation pitch, pause dura-
tion, the ratio between total pause time and total
speech time, and the ratio between total speech
time and total duration of the session were ex-
tracted. Pause durations were automatically ex-
tracted by applying silence detection where the
minimal silence duration was set at 500 ms. All
features were normalized per speaker by trans-
forming the raw feature values to z-scores (mean
and standard deviation were calculated over all 4
sessions, z = ((x-m)/sd)). The ratio between total
speech time and total duration time was not nor-
malized because this feature was calculated over
a whole session instead of a turn. Subsequently,
averages over all turns per session were taken in
order to obtain one value per session.

The results of the prosodic speech features over
the four sessions of the life-review intervention

pattern is in line with our expectations, showing
an increase in the sessions 3 and 4. In both Par-

4 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.988764333333333">
The aim of the present study was to investigate
the suitability of applying an analysis of proso-
dic speech features in the speech recordings

collected in psychological intervention based on
life-review. Because several studies have shown
that speech features can be used as indicators of
depression severity (e.g., Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993;
Stassen, Kuny, &amp; Hell, 1998), the application of
speech analyses in mental health care is promi-
sing. However, the measurement of speech fea-
tures is often based on speech recording tasks
and the ecological validity within psychological
interventions is not yet established. The study is
a first exploratory step to gain insight into the
ecological validity of prosodic speech features in
a psychological life-review intervention.
We expected to measure a change during the
intervention in the prosodic speech features that
could be related to depression symptoms, and
hypothesized an increase in average pitch and
pitch variation, a decrease in average pause dura-
tion, and an increase in the amount of speech by
the participant during the intervention. However,
we could not establish the ecological validity of
these speech indicators in the present study. In
general, the patterns of the prosodic speech indi-
cators differ from our expectations. The dyna-
mics in the speech indicators was different from
what can be expected in an intervention that is
effective in decreasing depression (Korte et al.,
2011; Serrano et al., 2004). Moreover, the speech
indicators were inconsistent with each other for
the participants in the pool. For example, Partici-
pant 3 showed an increase in pitch during the
intervention, which indicates a decrease in de-
pression, and an increase in average pause dura-
tion and pause speech ratio, which indicates an
increase in depression.
Taken together, the findings from the present
study indicate that the prosodic speech features
that have been validated for controlled settings,
are not directly applicable for the spontaneous
type of conversation that is typical for a mental
health care setting. More research is needed to
establish the ecological validity of prosodic
speech features such as pitch, pauses, and speech
duration as indicators of depression severity. A
few suggestions can be made. First, each of the
four sessions in the life-review intervention in
the present study focused on a different theme.
Although we aimed to evaluate the development
of the speech features during the intervention, the
differences across the session may be the conse-
quence of differences in session theme. More-
over, not all parts of the session consisted of
life-review, and participants were talking about a
variety of subjects, for example about their
caregivers. The goal of the life-review interven-
tion is to stimulate the retrieval of specific posi-
tive memories. In a next step, we aim to select
the parts in which the participant is recollecting
such memories and to evaluate the patterns in
prosodic speech features only for these parts.
Second, the prosodic speech indicators were
averaged per session to provide a clear overview
of the changes over the four sessions. However,
changes can also occur within the session. For
example, vocal pitch may increase during the
session, which would indicate a decrease in de-
pression symptoms. Furthermore, within each
session, the interaction between the interviewer
and participant may play a role. For instance,
when the interviewer speaks with a higher pitch
and more variation in pitch, the participant may
unconsciously take over some of this speaking
behavior. We suggest future studies to investi-
gate not only the average session, but to include
changes during the session the interviewer’s
speech features.
Third, the present research was conducted in
line with the assumption that life-review is effec-
tive as an intervention for mood disorder, as is
shown in several studies (Korte et al., 2011; Ser-
rano et al., 2004). However, we due to lack of
data on depression severity we do not know
whether the life-review intervention was fully
effective for the participants in the present study.
To validate the patterns prosodic speech features
as a reliable indicator for depressions that can be
used in mental health care, it is necessary to
demonstrate that the dynamics in speech fea-
tures can be related directly to changes in depres-
sion scores. As argued in earlier studies, in order
to conclude that speech features correlate signi-
ficantly with global depression scores during re-
covery (Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993; Stassen, Kuny, &amp;
Hell, 1998), these correlations need to be inves-
tigated in psychological interventions.
In sum, the study of how prosodic speech fea-
tures such as pitch and pauses relate to the kind
of spoken narratives that play a role in mental
health care settings is a promising field. How-
ever, the ecological validity of prosodic speech
features could not be established in the present
study. More research based on larger data sam-
ples the establishment of a direct relation to de-
pression scores is necessary before the tech-
niques from the field of computational linguistics
can be applied as a basis for the collection of in-
dicators that can be used in psychological inter-
ventions in a meaningful and effective way.

<abstract confidence="0.999731551724138">The present study aims to investigate the application of prosodic speech features in a psychological intervention based on lifereview. Several studies have shown that speech features can be used as indicators of depression severity, but these studies are mainly based on controlled speech recording tasks instead of natural conversations. The present exploratory study investigated speech features as indicators of depression in conversations of a therapeutic intervention. The changes in the prosodic speech features pitch, duration of pauses, and total duration of the speaking time studied over four sessions of a life-review intervention for three older participants. The ecological validity of the dynamics observed for prosodic speech features could not be established in the present study. The changes in speech features differed from what can be expected in an intervention that is effective in decreasing depression and were inconsistent with each other for each of the participants. We suggest future research to investigate changes within the intervention sessions, to relate the changes in feature values to the topical content of the speech, and to relate the speech features directly to depression scores.</abstract>

Clinicians do not have 62 the ability to differentiate precisely the duration of for example the patient’s utterances and pauses (Alpert et al. 2001). There is also ample evidence that text mining techniques based on the frequency of certain terms can be applied to narratives from patients in order to monitor changes in mood (Pennebaker &amp; Chung, 2011), and a recent study has shown that machines can better recognize certain emotions than lay people (Janssen et al., 2013), underlining once again the added value of automated speech analysis.

To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for depression and changes during the interventions, reliable and valid measures of depression severity are necessary. Depression severity is mostly measured by self-report questionnaires such as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D; Hamilton, 1960), and the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996). These self-report questionnaires often include items on mood and feelings. Moreover, questionnaire items may cover physical depression symptoms such as sleep disturbances, changes in weight 61 Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology: From Linguistic Signal to Clinical Reality, pages 61–68, Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 27, 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics and appetite, and loss in energy.

The present life-review course targets the recollection of specific, positive memories in older adults with depression symptoms. In four weekly sessions, the interviewer stimulates the recollection by asking questions on the depressed person’s childhood, adolescence, adulthood and life in general. An advantage of life-review in comparison to other therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is that it fits in with a natural activity of older adults to recollect memories and tell stories about their lives (Bluck &amp; Levine, 1998). Lifereview has shown to be an effective method to decrease depression symptoms (Korte, Bohlmeijer, Cappeliez, Smit, &amp; Westerhof, 2012; Pinquart &amp; Forstmeier, 2012) and is considered an evidence-based intervention for depression in older adults (Scogin, Welsh, Hanson, Stump, &amp; Coates, 2005).

Because the speech of both the interviewer and the participants were recorded on one mixed audio channel, some manual interventions had to be applied in order to determine the segments in which the participant is talking. First, for each session, the segments in which the participant is the main speaker were selected. These so-called ‘turns’ were then labeled in more detail; utterances produced by the interviewer were marked and discarded in the speech analysis.

After recovery from depression, the speech pause time of depressed adults was no longer elongated (Hardy et al., 1984). These results indicate that prosodic speech features are valid measures of depression. However, these studies have the limitation that the speech analyses are based on the recording of controlled speech based on tasks such as counting and reading out loud. Such speech recording tasks take place under ideal voice recording conditions (Cannizzaro, Harel, Reilly, Chappell, &amp; Snyder, 2004), while speech analysis is more difficult when conducted outside a controlled setting, because of so-called noisy channel effects (Janssen, Tacke, de Vries, van den Broek, Westerink, Haselager, &amp; IJsselsteijn, 2013).

Our study is one of the first to investigate prosodic speech features during a psychological intervention. The study is exploratory and aims to gain insight into the ecological validity of prosodic speech features in a psychological lifereview intervention. The life-review intervention offers the opportunity to investigate the prosodic speech features over time. Life-review is highly suitable to investigate speech features during an intervention, since the speech from the recall of autobiographical memories provides strong prosodic speech changes (Cohen, Hong, &amp; Guevara, 2010) and the expression of emotions characterized by speech characteristics is stronger after open and meaning-questions as compared to closed and fact-questions (Truong, Westerhof, Lamers, &amp; de Jong, under review).

Already in 1954, Moses concluded that the voice and speech patterns of psychiatric patients differed from those of people without a psychiatric diagnosis.

For these reasons, there is a need for valid and objective measures of depression severity. Not only to assess depression severity before and after therapy, but also to detect the dynamics during the therapy (Elliot, 2010). 1.1 Computational linguistics, speech analysis, and mental health care It is commonly assumed and confirmed in several studies that emotions and mood can influence the speaking behavior of a person and the characteristics of the sound in speech (Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993; Scherer, Johnstone, &amp; Klasmeyer, 2003). Already in 1954, Moses concluded that the voice and speech patterns of psychiatric patients differed from those of people without a psychiatric diagnosis. Clinicians observe the speech of depressed patients frequently as uniform, monotonous, slow, and with a low voice (Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993).

Speech total duration ratio of the participants (P1,P3,P5) during the four sessions. 4 Conclusion The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of applying an analysis of prosodic speech features in the speech recordings 65 collected in psychological intervention based on life-review. Because several studies have shown that speech features can be used as indicators of depression severity (e.g., Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993; Stassen, Kuny, &amp; Hell, 1998), the application of speech analyses in mental health care is promising. However, the measurement of speech features is often based on speech recording tasks and the ecological validity within psychological interventions is not yet established. The study is a first exploratory step to gain insight into the ecological validity of prosodic speech features in a psychological life-review intervention. We expected to measure a change during the intervention in the prosodic speech features that could be related to depression symptoms, and hypothesized an increase in ave</context>

However, we due to lack of data on depression severity we do not know whether the life-review intervention was fully effective for the participants in the present study. To validate the patterns prosodic speech features as a reliable indicator for depressions that can be used in mental health care, it is necessary to demonstrate that the dynamics in speech features can be related directly to changes in depression scores. As argued in earlier studies, in order to conclude that speech features correlate significantly with global depression scores during recovery (Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993; Stassen, Kuny, &amp; Hell, 1998), these correlations need to be investigated in psychological interventions. In sum, the study of how prosodic speech features such as pitch and pauses relate to the kind of spoken narratives that play a role in mental health care settings is a promising field. However, the ecological validity of prosodic speech features could not be established in the present study.

For example, speech features can be used to provide direct feedback to both the therapist and patient on the severity and changes in severity of depression during the psychological intervention. Clinicians do not have 62 the ability to differentiate precisely the duration of for example the patient’s utterances and pauses (Alpert et al. 2001). There is also ample evidence that text mining techniques based on the frequency of certain terms can be applied to narratives from patients in order to monitor changes in mood (Pennebaker &amp; Chung, 2011), and a recent study has shown that machines can better recognize certain emotions than lay people (Janssen et al., 2013), underlining once again the added value of automated speech analysis. To pave the way for future applications that would enable the use of speech features as a direct feedback mechanism, the first step is to gain more knowledge on the patterns in speech features and on how changes in these features can be considered as meaningful signals of patterns in psychological interventions.

Our paper is a first step to gain insight into the methods that are necessary to evaluate the application of prosodic speech features in mental health care. In the present study into the role of prosodic speech features, vocal pitch and pause duration will be investigated in three participants across all four weekly sessions. Because the life-review intervention is effective in decreasing depression symptoms (Korte et al., 2011; Serrano, Latorre, Gatz, &amp; Montanes, 2004), we expect that the prosodic features change accordingly. Therefore, we hypothesize (a) an increase in average vocal pitch, (b) an increase in the variation in vocal pitch, (c) a decrease in average pause duration, (d) a decrease in the ratio between the total pause time and total speech time (pause speech ratio), and (e) an increase in the ratio between the participant’s speech and total duration of the session (speech total duration ratio) during the intervention. 2 Method In this section we will describe the methodology applied in the design of the psychological interventions during which</context>

However, we could not establish the ecological validity of these speech indicators in the present study. In general, the patterns of the prosodic speech indicators differ from our expectations. The dynamics in the speech indicators was different from what can be expected in an intervention that is effective in decreasing depression (Korte et al., 2011; Serrano et al., 2004). Moreover, the speech indicators were inconsistent with each other for the participants in the pool. For example, Participant 3 showed an increase in pitch during the intervention, which indicates a decrease in depression, and an increase in average pause duration and pause speech ratio, which indicates an increase in depression. Taken together, the findings from the present study indicate that the prosodic speech features that have been validated for controlled settings, are not directly applicable for the spontaneous type of conversation that is typical for a mental health care setting.

For instance, when the interviewer speaks with a higher pitch and more variation in pitch, the participant may unconsciously take over some of this speaking behavior. We suggest future studies to investigate not only the average session, but to include changes during the session the interviewer’s speech features. Third, the present research was conducted in line with the assumption that life-review is effective as an intervention for mood disorder, as is shown in several studies (Korte et al., 2011; Serrano et al., 2004). However, we due to lack of data on depression severity we do not know whether the life-review intervention was fully effective for the participants in the present study. To validate the patterns prosodic speech features as a reliable indicator for depressions that can be used in mental health care, it is necessary to demonstrate that the dynamics in speech features can be related directly to changes in depression scores.

Already in 1954, Moses concluded that the voice and speech patterns of psychiatric patients differed from those of people without a psychiatric diagnosis. Clinicians observe the speech of depressed patients frequently as uniform, monotonous, slow, and with a low voice (Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993). A review by Sobin and Sackeim (1997) showed that depressed people differ from normal and other psychiatric groups on psychomotor symptoms such as speech. The speech of depressed patients is characterized by a longer pause duration, that is, an increased amount of time between speech utterances as well as by a reduced variability in mean vocal pitch. More recently these insights have led to collaborative and multidisciplinary work between researchers from the fields of computational linguistics and mental health care.

Because vocal acoustic features such as pause durations and pitch are biologically based, it has even been argued that they can serve as biomarkers of depression severity (Mundt et al., 2012). As a consequence, speech features such as pitch and pause durations can be used to estimate the severity of a depression. To date, several studies investigated the validity of several speech features as indicators of depression. Indeed, the speech features pitch and speech loudness correlate significantly with global depression scores during recovery (Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993; Stassen, Kuny, &amp; Hell, 1998). After recovery from depression, the speech pause time of depressed adults was no longer elongated (Hardy et al., 1984). These results indicate that prosodic speech features are valid measures of depression. However, these studies have the limitation that the speech analyses are based on the recording of controlled speech based on tasks such as counting and reading out loud. Such speech recording tasks take place under ideal voice recording conditions (Cannizzaro, Harel, Reilly, Chappell, &amp; Snyder, 2004), while speech analysis is more difficult when conducted outside a controlled setting, be</context>

Speech total duration ratio of the participants (P1,P3,P5) during the four sessions. 4 Conclusion The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of applying an analysis of prosodic speech features in the speech recordings 65 collected in psychological intervention based on life-review. Because several studies have shown that speech features can be used as indicators of depression severity (e.g., Kuny &amp; Stassen, 1993; Stassen, Kuny, &amp; Hell, 1998), the application of speech analyses in mental health care is promising. However, the measurement of speech features is often based on speech recording tasks and the ecological validity within psychological interventions is not yet established. The study is a first exploratory step to gain insight into the ecological validity of prosodic speech features in a psychological life-review intervention. We expected to measure a change during the intervention in the prosodic speech features that could be related to depression symptoms, and hypothesized an increase in average pitch and pitch variatio</context>

In sum, the study of how prosodic speech features such as pitch and pauses relate to the kind of spoken narratives that play a role in mental health care settings is a promising field. However, the ecological validity of prosodic speech features could not be established in the present study.

The psychological intervention in the present study is based on life-review: the structured recollection of autobiographical memories. Depressed people have difficulties in retrieving specific, positive memories. Their autobiographical memory is characterized by more negative and general memories (e.g., Williams et al., 2007), for example memories that reflect a period or recurrent event (e.g., the period of a marriage) rather than a specific event (e.g., the ceremony on the wedding day). The present life-review course targets the recollection of specific, positive memories in older adults with depression symptoms. In four weekly sessions, the interviewer stimulates the recollection by asking questions on the depressed person’s childhood, adolescence, adulthood and life in general. An advantage of life-review in comparison to other therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is that it fits in with a natural a</context>

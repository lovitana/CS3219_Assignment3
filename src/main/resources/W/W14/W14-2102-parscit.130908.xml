Argumentation mining involves automat-
ically identifying the premises, conclu-
sion, and type of each argument as well
as relationships between pairs of argu-
ments in a document. We describe our
plan to create a corpus from the biomedi-
cal genetics research literature, annotated
to support argumentation mining re-
search. We discuss the argumentation el-
ements to be annotated, theoretical chal-
lenges, and practical issues in creating
such a corpus.

Argumentation mining is a relatively new chal-
lenge in corpus-based discourse analysis that in-
volves automatically identifying argumentation
within a document, i.e., the premises, conclusion,
and type of each argument, as well as relation-
ships between pairs of arguments in the docu-
ment. To date, researchers have investigated
methods for argumentation mining of non-
scientific text and dialogue. However, the lack of
appropriately annotated corpora has hindered
research on argumentation mining of scientific
research articles. Using the term „argument‟ in a
related but different sense than here, researchers
have investigated annotation of scientific ab-
stracts and full-text articles (e.g. Teufel, 2002;
Mizuta et al., 2005; Liakata et al., 2012). How-
ever, the annotated corpora they have created are
not designed for argumentation mining in the
above sense.
Our goal is to create a freely available corpus
of open-access, full-text scientific articles from
the biomedical genetics research literature, anno-
tated to support argumentation mining research.
The corpus also would provide a rich new re-
source for researchers in related areas including
information retrieval, information extraction,
summarization, and question-answering. There is
a critical need for automated analysis of the rap-
idly growing genetics research literature. Availa-
bility of the corpus should promote the develop-
ment of computational tools for use by biomedi-
cal and genetics researchers. In the future, e.g., a
tool enabled by argumentation mining could be
used to automatically summarize arguments in
the research literature that a certain genetic muta-
tion is a cause of breast cancer. Methods devel-
oped from experimentation with this corpus
should be adaptable to other scientific domains
as well.
Section 2 of this paper discusses some terms
from argumentation theory that are relevant to
our goals and surveys related work. Section 3
discusses examples of argumentation in the tar-
get literature. The next three sections discuss
challenges, practical issues, and future plans for
creating the corpus.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999879833333333">
Traditionally, an argument is said to consist of a
set of premises and a conclusion, and a formal
model such as deductive logic is used to deter-
mine whether the argument is valid. An argu-
ment can be attacked by refuting a premise or by
presenting an argument for a conclusion in con-
tradiction to the original conclusion. However
Toulmin (1998), who was concerned with mod-
eling arguments in fields such as law and sci-
ence, argued that logical validity is too restrictive
a criterion for determining argument acceptabil-
ity. Toulmin distinguished two types of premis-

es: data, i.e., observations or conclusions of oth-
er arguments, and warrant, i.e., a field-
dependent accepted principle (such as a legal
rule or a “law” of science).
Argumentation schemes are abstract descrip-
tions of forms of argument that are used to con-
struct acceptable arguments in everyday conver-
sation, law, and science (Walton et al., 2008).
Argumentation schemes may describe non-
deductively valid arguments, and their conclu-
sions may be retracted when more information is
obtained. For example, an abductive argumenta-
tion scheme, often used in genetic counseling
(Green et al., 2011), is reasoning from observa-
tions to a hypothesized cause. Critical questions
associated with argumentation schemes play an
important role in evaluating argument acceptabil-
ity (Walton et al., 2008). For example, one of the
critical questions of the abductive argumentation
scheme is whether there is an alternative, more
plausible explanation for the observation used as
a premise. An enthymeme is an argument with
implicit premises or conclusion. Argumentation
schemes are sometimes useful in reconstruction
of missing components of enthymemes.

2.2 Argumentation Corpora
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99900784375">
A corpus of genetic counseling patient letters
was analyzed in several ways to design a compu-
tational model for generation of arguments from
healthcare experts to patients (Green et al.,
2011). An annotation scheme was developed to
describe the conceptual model of genetic disease
and inheritance communicated to patients
(Green, 2005a). Formal argumentation schemes
describing arguments found in the corpus were
defined (Green et al., 2011). Analyses of prag-
matic features included rhetorical relations
(Green, 2010a), ordering constraints and dis-
course markers (Green et al., 2011), point of
view (Green 2005b), and use of probability ex-
pressions (Green 2010b). However, it was not a
goal of that project to provide a publicly availa-
ble corpus.
The Araucaria argumentation diagramming
tool was developed to aid human analysts and
students to visualize and annotate naturally oc-
curring arguments (Reed and Rowe, 2004). Dia-
grams can be stored as text files with stand-off
annotation of premises and conclusions, argu-
mentation schemes, and relationships between
arguments. The Araucaria project has created a
publicly available corpus of annotated argumen-
tation from newspaper articles, parliamentary
records, magazines, and on-line discussion
boards (Reed et al., 2010). The corpus has been
used in some argumentation mining research
(Mochales and Moens, 2011; Feng and Hirst,
2011; Cabrio and Villata, 2012).

2.3 Argumentation Mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906285714286">
To date, researchers have investigated methods
for argumentation mining of non-science con-
tent: legal documents (Mochales and Moens,
2011; Bach et al., 2013; Ashley and Walker,
2013; Wyner et al., 2010), on-line debates (Cab-
rio and Villata, 2012), product reviews (Villalba
and Saint-Dizier, 2012; Wyner et al., 2012), and
newspaper articles and court cases (Feng and
Hirst, 2011). Here we summarize the work that is
most relevant to our project.
Mochales and Moens (2011) experimented
with the Araucaria corpus and a legal corpus.
They developed a multi-stage approach to argu-
mentation mining. The first stage, argumentative
information detection, addresses the problem of
classifying a sentence (or sentential subunit) as
being part of an argument or not. Next, argument
boundary detection, or segmentation, is the prob-
lem of determining the boundaries of each argu-
ment. Third, argumentative proposition classifi-
cation labels the sentences in an argument ac-
cording to their role as a premise or the conclu-
sion. Lastly, argumentation structure detection is
the problem of detecting the relationships be-
tween arguments, i.e., whether two atomic argu-
ments are “chained” (the conclusion of one is a
premise of another), whether multiple arguments
are provided in support of the same conclusion,
and whether one argument attacks another argu-
ment in some way. Statistical techniques were
used for the first three stages, while manually
constructed context-free grammar rules were
used for argumentation structure detection.
Cabrio and Villata (2012) used an approach to
argumentation structure detection based on cal-
culating textual entailment (Dagan 2006) to de-
tect support and attack relations between argu-
ments in a corpus of on-line dialogues stating
user opinions.
Feng and Hirst (2011) focused on the problem
of argumentation scheme recognition in the Ar-
aucaria corpus. Assuming that the conclusion
and premises of an argument have been identi-
fied already, classification techniques achieved
high accuracy for two argumentation schemes
described in (Walton et al., 2008), argument
from example and practical reasoning. Those
schemes are less likely to be useful in analysis of
scientific texts however.

In fact, since scientific research articles sub-
stantially differ from the genres that have been
explored for argumentation mining so far, it is an
open question what techniques will be successful
in the scientific literature.

2.4 Argumentative Zoning and Related
Annotation Schemes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997552112676">
Some NLP researchers have studied ways to au-
tomatically identify discourse structure in scien-
tific text. The motivation is to provide contextual
information that will improve automatic infor-
mation access without the need to represent or
reason about domain knowledge (Teufel, 2010).
These researchers have developed several anno-
tation schemes.
The argumentative zoning (AZ) annotation
scheme was developed for automatically classi-
fying the sentences of a scientific article in terms
of their contribution of new knowledge to a field
(Teufel and Moens, 2002; Teufel, 2010). Ap-
plied to articles in computational linguistics, AZ
labels “zones” or variable-length sequences of
sentences with one of seven categories: AIM
(the research goal of the article), BASIS (the
contribution of existing knowledge to a
knowledge claim of the article), CONTRAST
(criticizing or negatively contrasting competi-
tors&apos; knowledge claims to a knowledge claim of
the article), TEXTUAL (indicating the structure
of the article), BACKGROUND (generally ac-
cepted background knowledge), OTHER (exist-
ing knowledge claims), and OWN (describing
any aspect of a new knowledge claim made by
the authors).
An extension of AZ (AZ-II) developed for ap-
plication to chemistry articles, refined AZ&apos;s dis-
tinctions into fifteen categories (Teufel, 2010). In
another extension of AZ developed for genetics
articles (Mizuta et al., 2005), the AZ OWN cate-
gory was replaced by categories distinguishing
descriptions of methodology (MTH), experi-
mental results (RSL), insights from experimental
results or previous work (INS), and implications
(such as conjectures and applications) of experi-
mental results or previous work (IMP).
The CoreSC (Core Scientific Concepts) anno-
tation scheme was developed for automatic clas-
sification of sentences in terms of the compo-
nents of a scientific investigation: Hypothesis,
Motivation, Goal, Object, Background, Method,
Experiment, Model, Observation, Result and
Conclusion (Liakata et al., 2012a). An automatic
classifier for CoreSC was developed and evalu-
ated on a corpus of 265 full-text articles in bio-
chemistry and chemistry. A comparison study
(Liakata et al., 2012b) in which articles were an-
notated with both AZ-II and CoreSC “found that
CoreSC provides finer granularity ... while the
strength of AZ-II lies in detecting the attribution
of knowledge claims and identifying the different
functions of background information” (Liakata et
al. 2012b, p. 45). Liakata et al. (2012b) com-
pared CoreSC to two other scientific discourse
annotation schemes (Thompson et al., 2011; De
Waard and Pander Maat, 2009). The three
schemes were found to be complementary, oper-
ating at different levels of granularity.
However, none of the above annotation
schemes address argumentation as described in
section 2.3. They are not designed to identify the
premises and conclusion of each argument (in-
cluding missing components of enthymemes)
and the argumentation scheme, nor relationships
between pairs of arguments. Nevertheless, we
plan to coordinate our efforts with that research
community to benefit from their expertise and to
ensure that our corpus will ultimately provide a
valuable resource for their research.

3 Examples
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982318181818">
In this section we discuss examples of some of
the arguments in an article (Schrauwen et al.,
2012) that is representative of the articles to be
included in the corpus. The main claim of this
article is that a c.637+1G&gt;T mutation of the
CABP2 gene in the region 11q12.3-11q13.3
(DFNB93) is a cause of autosomal recessive
non-syndromic hearing loss (arNSHL) in hu-
mans. The article&apos;s body is divided into four sec-
tions: Introduction, Material and Methods, Re-
sults, and Discussion. The following examples in
Table 1 are from the first subsection of the Re-
sults section (under the subheading “Next-
Generation Sequencing of the DFNB93 Region
Identifies a Splice-Site Mutation in CABP2”).
The excerpt has been manually segmented into
regions of text conveying arguments. Adjacent
segments not conveying arguments have been
omitted to save space; the approximate number
of omitted lines is given in square brackets. Also,
for readability, alternative identifiers of genetic
variants have been replaced by ellipses.

1 ¶The DFNB93 region contains more than
300 annotated and hypothetical genes,
and several genes are expressed in the
mouse and human inner ear. Because
there are many strong candidate genes in
the region, we sequenced all genes and
noncoding genes in this region by using
a custom DNA capture array to identify
the disease-causing mutation in one af-
fected individual from the family.

2 ¶After the identified homozygous vari-
ants were filtered through the 1000 Ge-
nomes Project November 2010 release
and dbSNP131, 47 previously unreported
variants remained and included two exo-
nic mutations, one splicing mutation, six
nontranslated mutations, 16 intergenic
(downstream or upstream) mutations,
and 22 intronic mutations.
3 The two exonic variants included one
nonsynonymous variant, c.1379A&gt;G ...
in PPFIA1 ... and synonymous variant
c.174G&gt;A ... in GAL3ST3 ... The
splice-site variant, c.637+1G&gt;T ... was
located at the 5′ donor site of intron 6 of
CABP2 (Figure 1 and Figure S1, availa-
ble online).
¶The variants in PPFIA1 and CABP2
were subsequently validated by Sanger
DNA sequencing, which only confirmed
the splicing variant in CABP2.

4 Next, we checked the inheritance of the
CABP2 variant in the entire Sh10 family
(Figure 1) and screened an additional
100 random Iranian controls to ensure
that the variant is not a frequent poly-
morphism. The mutation was not detect-
ed in any of the controls, and inheritance
was consistent with hearing loss in the
family.

In an annotation scheme such as AZ, the first
sentence of segment 1 might be classified as
BKG (background) and the second as MTH
(methodology). In CoreSC, the second sentence
might be classified as Hypothesis and Method.
However, the following argument is also com-
municated in (1) to the intended audience of sci-
entists. (A genetics researcher has confirmed our
interpretation of the arguments in this paper.)
Note that in the following analyses in our paper,
square brackets indicate implicit information de-
rivable from the discourse context or domain
knowledge. In the following argument, two of
the premises are implicit, i.e., this is an example
of an enthymeme. Also, premises are distin-
guished as Data or Warrant, where the former
type of premise corresponds to old or new evi-
dence or a conclusion of another argument in the
article, and the latter to generally accepted prin-
ciples or assumptions in genetics. It is under-
stood by the intended audience that warrants may
have exceptions and that the conclusions of the
following arguments are tentative.
Note that the conclusion of Argument 1 has
been recovered from the phrase there are many
strong candidate genes in the region. The argu-
ment can be analyzed in terms of a type of ab-
ductive argumentation scheme, i.e., reasoning
from effect (arNSHL) to plausible cause (a muta-
tion in the DFNB932 region). For a specification
of the argumentation schemes identified in the
genetics paper, see (Green and Schug, in prepa-
ration).

Data: Several genes in the DFNB93 region are
expressed in the human inner ear.
Data: [arNSHL involves the inner ear]

Warrant: [Autosomal recessive genetic condi-
tions are caused by homozygous mutations.]

in the DFNB93 region may be a cause of
arNSHL in humans.
In an annotation scheme such as AZ, the sub-
ordinate clause at the beginning of segment 2
might be classified as MTH, and the main clause
as RSL (results). However it has been analyzed
in Argument 2 as an instance of an argumenta-
tion scheme involving the elimination of candi-
dates. Note that the identity of the arNSHL-
affected individual whose DNA was tested
(V:14) and the family to which she belonged (Sh
10) was not specified in this section, but was
given in the Material and Methods section. Also
note that the first premise in Argument 2 is the
conclusion of the preceding Argument 1. In our
paper, this is indicated by providing the previous

affected individual, identified as V:14 of family
Sh10] 47 previously unreported [i.e. not frequent

the DFNB93 region were identified.
Warrant: [If a variant is a frequent polymorphism
then it is not a cause of a genetic condition]
Conclusion: [One of the 47 variants may be the
cause of arNSHL in individual V:14]
Various clauses in segment 3 might be classi-
fied as MTH or RSL in a scheme such as AZ. In
an argumentation analysis, however, it conveys
an argument that the CABP2 mutation may be
the cause of arNSHL in one individual (:V14),
after the elimination of the other candidates.

Segment 4 uses two different sets of data to
argue that the c.637+1G&gt;T variant of CABP2
may be the cause of arNSHL in the family of
V:14, Sh10. In a scheme such as AZ, the first
sentence would probably be described as MTH
and the second as RSL. However, an argumenta-
tion analysis provides two arguments, 4a and 4b.

In addition to identifying individual argu-
ments, argumentation mining addresses relation-
ships between pairs of arguments. Arguments 1-
4a illustrate a chain of arguments, i.e., where the
conclusion of Argument i is a premise of Argu-
ment i+1. Also, arguments 4a and 4b illustrate
two arguments in support of the same conclu-
sion. Note that, individually, Arguments 1-3 are
relatively weak. However, Argument 1 might be
useful in answer to a query such as What regions
may carry a mutation leading to arISHL? Ar-
guments 2-3 might be useful in answer to a query
such as Have any individual cases of arISHL
been attributed to a mutation of CABP2? Argu-
ments 1-4a and Argument 4b could be given as
the answer to the query What mutation may be
the cause of arISHL in an affected family? (Note
that in an interactive query facility, instead of
presenting the user with a chain of arguments,
the system could leave it up to the user to “drill
down” to see the subarguments in a chain.)
The above arguments are provided here for
purposes of illustration. In the remainder of the
genetics article the main claim (that the CABP2
mutation is a cause of arNSHL in humans) is
supported by arguments that the mutation is the
cause of arNSHL in two other families. Also,
using a different type of argumentation, it pro-
vides a biochemical explanation for how the mu-
tation may cause an abnormality in the inner ear
that could cause hearing loss. In addition to the
main claim, the article contains several other
supported claims, e.g., that the c.637+1G&gt;T var-
iant of CABP2 may be a founder mutation.

4 Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965217391304">
Argumentation mining of this type of discourse
will be challenging. A challenge that is shared
with BioNLP text mining in general is dealing
with the extensive use of biological, chemical,
and clinical terminology in the BioNLP domain.
A number of challenges specific to argumenta-
tion mining are discussed next.
To specify an argument it is necessary to iden-
tify the premises (or data and warrant), conclu-
sion, and argumentation scheme. However, as
illustrated in the previous examples, arguments
with implicit components (enthymemes) are
common, e.g., where a conclusion is implicit or
used as an implicit premise of another argument.
A related challenge is to supply domain
knowledge for reconstructing implicit warrants
in this genre. Another related challenge is the
need to make use of discourse context to supply
missing information, e.g., where context is re-
quired to supply the identity of individual V:14
in Argument 2. Note that in that case, it was nec-
essary to read the previous Materials and Meth-
ods section to supply that information.
Another problem illustrated in the example is
that argument boundaries do not coincide with
sentential subunit boundaries. For example, seg-
ment 4 contains parts of Argument 4a and 4b in
the first sentence and parts of those two argu-
ments in the second sentence. Furthermore, iden-
tification of argument components does not ap-
pear to be systematically associated with dis-
course markers such as `therefore&apos;. However, the
arguments contain lexical items relating to scien-
tific discovery (e.g., `confirmed&apos;, `detected&apos;,
`consistent with&apos;, `indicate&apos;, `is likely that&apos;, `ex-
pected to&apos;, `showed&apos;, `suggests&apos;) that may aid in
automatic identification of the components.
Our analysis of argumentation in genetic coun-
seling (Green et al., 2011) and in the genetics
research literature (Green and Schug, in prepara-
tion) has identified other (and more specific) ar-
gumentation schemes and critical questions than
those listed in (Walton et al., 2008). Since some
of the argumentation schemes we have identified
are causal, lexical patterns of causality may be
useful features for use in argumentation mining.

i.e., where the conclusion of an argument is
the premise of a subsequent argument.
Note that we plan to employ graduate students
with a background in genetics and biochemistry
as coders.
Identifying implicit components of arguments
will be challenging for coders. However, there
are a number of constraints that will be given in
the instructions to help the coders. First, they
will be given a list of commonly accepted princi-
ples of genetics as possible warrants, such as
Mendel&apos;s laws, the concept of segregation in a
pedigree, etc. Second, coders will be instructed
to look for chained arguments, i.e., where the
premises/conclusions of chained arguments can
be reconstructed from the relationship between
two arguments. Third, coders will be given a de-
scription of argumentation schemes, which also
constrain the interpretation of argument compo-
nents.
A pilot annotated corpus and associated docu-
mentation of the argumentation coding scheme
will be made available to other researchers on a
temporary basis for the purpose of publicizing
the planned corpus and getting feedback from
potential stakeholders.
An important consideration is the selection of
corpus annotation tools to facilitate argumenta-
tion mining research. On the one hand, the text

mining community uses linguistic annotation
tools such as GATE (http://gate.ac.uk/), UIMA
(http://www.ibm.com/research/uima), and Open-
NLP tools http://opennlp.sourceforge.net). It
would be advisable to use tools that would allow
that community to benefit from the argumenta-
tion corpus, as well as to allow argumentation
mining researchers to use previously developed
tools. For example, argumentation mining re-
searchers may find it useful to automatically pre-
process the corpus with linguistic annotations as
well as the annotation schemes described in sec-
tion 2.4. BioNLP researchers may find it useful
to consider argumentation annotations as well.
Just as modality and negation currently are used
for BioNLP tasks, a text segment‟s participation
in argumentation as outlined in this paper may
provide useful context at a deeper level of analy-
sis.
On the other hand, the argumentation and edu-
cational community uses tools for diagramming
argumentation, e.g.
Araucaria http://arg.computing.dundee.ac.uk and
LASAD http://cscwlab.in.tu-clausthal.de/ lasad).
It is important to maintain compatibility between
argumentation mining corpora developed with
linguistic annotation tools and corpora developed
with diagramming tools.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991454545454">
This paper described our plan to create a freely
available corpus of open-access, full-text scien-
tific articles from the biomedical genetics re-
search literature, annotated to support argumen-
tation mining research. It discussed the argumen-
tation elements to be annotated, theoretical chal-
lenges, and practical issues in creating such a
corpus. We hope this workshop will provide an
opportunity for us to get feedback from potential
users (or contributors) to this effort, and possibly
even identify synergistic research opportunities.

Argumentation schemes may describe nondeductively valid arguments, and their conclusions may be retracted when more information is obtained. For example, an abductive argumentation scheme, often used in genetic counseling (Green et al., 2011), is reasoning from observations to a hypothesized cause. Critical questions associated with argumentation schemes play an important role in evaluating argument acceptability (Walton et al., 2008). For example, one of the critical questions of the abductive argumentation scheme is whether there is an alternative, more plausible explanation for the observation used as a premise.

To date, researchers have investigated methods for argumentation mining of nonscientific text and dialogue. However, the lack of appropriately annotated corpora has hindered research on argumentation mining of scientific research articles. Using the term „argument‟ in a related but different sense than here, researchers have investigated annotation of scientific abstracts and full-text articles (e.g. Teufel, 2002; Mizuta et al., 2005; Liakata et al., 2012). However, the annotated corpora they have created are not designed for argumentation mining in the above sense. Our goal is to create a freely available corpus of open-access, full-text scientific articles from the biomedical genetics research literature, annotated to support argumentation mining research. The corpus also would provide a rich new resource for researchers in related areas including information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, and question-answering.

In another extension of AZ developed for genetics articles (Mizuta et al., 2005), the AZ OWN category was replaced by categories distinguishing descriptions of methodology (MTH), experimental results (RSL), insights from experimental results or previous work (INS), and implications (such as conjectures and applications) of experimental results or previous work (IMP).

An automatic classifier for CoreSC was developed and evaluated on a corpus of 265 full-text articles in biochemistry and chemistry. A comparison study (Liakata et al., 2012b) in which articles were annotated with both AZ-II and CoreSC “found that CoreSC provides finer granularity ... while the strength of AZ-II lies in detecting the attribution of knowledge claims and identifying the different functions of background information” (Liakata et al. 2012b, p. 45). Liakata et al. (2012b) compared CoreSC to two other scientific discourse annotation schemes (Thompson et al., 2011; De Waard and Pander Maat, 2009). The three schemes were found to be complementary, operating at different levels of granularity. However, none of the above annotation schemes address argumentation as described in section 2.3. They are not designed to identify the premises and conclusion of each argument (including missing components of enthymemes) and the argumentation scheme, nor relationships between pairs of arguments.

An argument can be attacked by refuting a premise or by presenting an argument for a conclusion in contradiction to the original conclusion. However Toulmin (1998), who was concerned with modeling arguments in fields such as law and science, argued that logical validity is too restrictive a criterion for determining argument acceptability.

Feng and Hirst (2011) focused on the problem of argumentation scheme recognition in the Araucaria corpus.

The corpus has been used in some argumentation mining research (Mochales and Moens, 2011; Feng and Hirst, 2011; Cabrio and Villata, 2012). 2.3 Argumentation Mining To date, researchers have investigated methods for argumentation mining of non-science content: legal documents (Mochales and Moens, 2011; Bach et al., 2013; Ashley and Walker, 2013; Wyner et al., 2010), on-line debates (Cabrio and Villata, 2012), product reviews (Villalba and Saint-Dizier, 2012; Wyner et al., 2012), and newspaper articles and court cases (Feng and Hirst, 2011). Here we summarize the work that is most relevant to our project. Mochales and Moens (2011) experimented with the Araucaria corpus and a legal corpus. They developed a multi-stage approach to argumentation mining. The first stage, argumentative information detection, addresses the problem of classifying a sentence (or sentential subunit) as being part of an argument or not. Next, argument boundary detection, or segmen</context>

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999935472222222">
Information retrieval (IR) aims at retrieving and
ranking documents relative to a textual query ex-
pressing the information need of a user (Manning
et al., 2008). IR has become a crucial technology
for many organisations that deal with vast amounts
of partly structured and unstructured (free text)
data stored in electronic format, including hospi-
tals and other health care providers. IR is an es-
sential part of the clinical practice; e.g., on-line IR
systems are associated with substantial improve-
ments in clinicians decision-making concerning
clinical problems (Westbrook et al., 2005).
The different stages of the clinical care of a pa-
tient are documented in clinical care notes, con-
sisting mainly of free text. A care episode consists
of a sequence of individual clinical care notes,
concluded by a discharge summary, as illustrated
in Figure 1. Care episodes are stored in elec-
tronic format in electronic health record (EHR)
systems. These systems are used throughout the
health care sector by patients, administrators and
professionals from different areas, primarily for
clinical purposes, but also for secondary purposes
such as decision support and research (H¨ayrinen et
al., 2008). IR from EHR in general is therefore a
common and important task.
This paper focuses on the particular task of re-
trieving those care episodes that are most similar
to the sequence of clinical notes for a given pa-
tient, which we will call care episode retrieval.
In conventional IR, the query typically consists of
several keywords or a short phrase, while the re-
trievable units are typically documents. In con-
trast, in care episode retrieval, the query consist of
the clinical notes contained in a care episode. The
discharge summary is used separately for evalu-

The documentation of a care episode con-
sists of clinical notes concerning patient
care, concluded with a discharge sum-
mary. Care episodes are stored electron-
ically and used throughout the health care
sector by patients, administrators and pro-
fessionals from different areas, primarily
for clinical purposes, but also for sec-
ondary purposes such as decision support
and research. A common use case is, given
a – possibly unfinished – care episode,
to retrieve the most similar care episodes
among the records. This paper presents
several methods for information retrieval,
focusing on care episode retrieval, based
on textual similarity, where similarity is
measured through domain-specific mod-
elling of the distributional semantics of
words. Models include variants of random
indexing and a semantic neural network
model called word2vec. A novel method is
introduced that utilizes the ICD-10 codes
attached to care episodes to better induce
domain-specificity in the semantic model.
We report on an experimental evaluation
of care episode retrieval that circumvents
the lack of human judgements regarding
episode relevance by exploiting (1) ICD-
10 codes of care episodes and (2) seman-
tic similarity between their discharge sum-
maries. Results suggest that several of the
methods proposed outperform a state-of-
the art search engine (Lucene) on the re-
trieval task.

ation purposes, and is assumed to be unavailable
for constructing a query at retrieval time. Retriev-
able units are thus complete care episodes without
summaries.
We envision a number of different use cases for
a care episode retrieval system. Firstly, it could fa-
cilitate clinicians in decision-making. For exam-
ple, given a patient that is being treated in a hos-
pital, an involved clinician may want to find previ-
ous patients that are similar in terms of their health
history, symptoms or received treatments. Supple-
mentary input from the clinician would enable the
system to give heightened weight to keywords of
particular interest within the care episodes, which
would further be emphasized in the semantic sim-
ilarity calculation during IR. It may help consider-
ably to see what similar patients have received in
terms of medication and further treatment, what
related issues such as bi-conditions or risks oc-
curred, how other clinicians have described cer-
tain aspects, what clinical practice guidelines have
been utilized, and so on. This relates to the un-
derlying principle in textual case-based reasoning
(Lenz et al., 1998). Secondly, it could help man-
agement to get almost real time information con-
cerning the overall situation on the unit for a spe-
cific follow-up period. Such a system could for ex-
ample support managerial decision-making with
statistical information concerning care trends on
the unit, adverse events or infections. Thirdly, it
could facilitate knowledge discovery and research.
For instance, it could enable researchers to map
or cluster similar care episodes to find common
symptoms or conditions. In sum, care episode re-
trieval is likely to improve care quality and consis-
tency in hospitals.
From the perspective of NLP, care episode re-
trieval – and IR from EHRs in general – is a
challenging task. It differs from general-purpose
web search in that the vocabulary, the informa-
tion needs and the queries of clinicians are highly
specialised (Yang et al., 2011). Clinical notes
contain highly domain-specific terminology (Rec-
tor, 1999; Friedman et al., 2002; Allvin et al.,
2010) and generic text processing resources are
therefore often suboptimal or inadequate (Shatkay,
2005). At the same time, development of dedi-
cated clinical NLP tools and resources is often dif-
ficult and costly. For example, popular data-driven
approaches to NLP are based on supervised learn-
ing, which requires substantial amounts of tailored
training data, typically built through manual anno-
tation by annotators who need both linguistic and
clinical knowledge. Additionally, variations in the
language and terminology used in sub-domains
within and across health care organisations greatly
limit the scope of applicability of such training
data (Rector, 1999).
Recent work has shown that distributional mod-
els of semantics, induced in an unsupervised man-
ner from large corpora of clinical and/or medical
text, are well suited as a resource-light approach
to capturing and representing domain-specific ter-
minology (Pedersen et al., 2007; Koopman et al.,
2012; Henriksson et al., 2014). This raises the
question to what extent distributional models of
semantics can alleviate the aforementioned prob-
lems of NLP in the clinical domain. The work
reported here investigates to what extent distribu-
tional models of semantics, built from a corpus of
clinical text in an fully unsupervised manner, can
be used for care episode retrieval. Models include
several variants of random indexing and a seman-
tic neural network model called word2vec, which
will be described in more detail in Section 4.
It has been argued that clinical NLP should ex-
ploit existing knowledge resources such as knowl-
edge bases about medications, treatments, dis-
eases, symptoms and care plans, despite these not
having been explicitly built for doing clinical NLP
(Friedman et al., 2013). Along these lines, a novel
method is proposed here that utilizes the ICD-10
codes – diagnostic labels attached to care episodes
by clinicians – to better induce domain-specificity
in the semantic model. Experimental results sug-
gest that this method outperforms a state-of-the art
search engine (Lucene) on the task of care episode

retrieval.
Apart from issues related to clinical terminol-
ogy, another problem in care episode retrieval is
the lack of benchmark data, such as the relevance
scores produced by human judges commonly used
for evaluation of IR systems. Although collec-
tions of care episodes may be available, producing
gold standard similarity scores required for evalu-
ation is costly. Another contribution of this paper
is the proposal of evaluation procedures that cir-
cumvent the lack of human judgements regarding
episode similarity. This is accomplished by ex-
ploiting either (1) ICD-10 codes of care episodes
or (2) semantic similarity between their discharge
summaries. Despite our focus on the specific task
of care episode retrieval, we hypothesize that the
methods and models proposed here have the po-
tential to increase performance of IR on clinical
text in general.

2 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988282608696">
The data set used in this study consists of the elec-
tronic health records from patients with any type
of heart related problem that were admitted to one
particular university hospital in Finland between
the years 2005-2009. Of these, only the clini-
cal notes written by physician are used. A sup-
porting statement for the research was obtained
from the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District
(17.2.2009 §67) and permission to conduct the re-
search was obtained from the Medical Director of
the Hospital District (2/2009). The total set consist
of 66884 care episodes, which amounts to 398040
notes and 64 million words in total. This full set
was used for training of the semantic models. To
make the experimentation more convenient, we
chose to use a subset for evaluation. This com-
prises 26530 care episodes, amounting to 155562
notes and 25.7 million words in total.
Notes are mostly unstructured, consisting of
free text in Finnish. Some meta-data – such as
names of the authors, dates, wards, and so on – is
present, but is not used for retrieval.
Care episodes have been manually labeled ac-
cording to the 10th revision of the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (World Health
Organization and others, 2013), a standardised
tool of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases.
Codes are normally applied at the end of the pa-
tient’s stay, or even after the patient has been dis-
charged from the hospital. Care episodes have
one primary ICD-10 code attached and optionally
a number of additionally relevant codes. In this
study, only the primary one is used, because ex-
traction of the secondary codes is non-trivial.
ICD-10 codes have an internal structure that re-
flects the classification system ranging from broad
categories down to fine-grained subjects. For ex-
ample, the first character (J) of the code J21.1
signals that it belongs to the broad category Dis-
eases of the respiratory system. The next two
digits (21) classify the subject as belonging to
the subcategory Acute bronchiolitis. Finally, the
last digit after the dot (1) means that it belongs
to the sub-subclass Acute bronchiolitis due to hu-
man metapneumovirus. There are 356 unique “pri-
mary” ICD-10 codes in the evaluation data set.

3 Task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979212121212">
The task addressed in this study is retrieval of care
episodes that are similar to each other. In con-
trast to the normal IR setting, where the search
query is derived from a text stating the user’s in-
formation need, here the query is based on an-
other care episode, which we refer to as the query
episode. As the query episode may document on-
going treatment, and thus lack a discharge sum-
mary and ICD-10 code, neither of these informa-
tion sources can be relied upon for constructing
the query. The task is therefore to retrieve the most
similar care episodes using only the information
contained in the free text of the clinical notes in
the query episode.
Evaluation of retrieval results generally re-
quires an assessment of their relevancy to the
query. Since similarity judgements by humans
are currently lacking, and obtaining these is time-
consuming and costly, we explored alternative
ways of evaluating performance on the task. The
first alternative is to assume that care episodes are
similar if they have the same ICD-10 code. That is,
a retrieved care episode is considered correct if its
ICD-10 code is identical to the code of the query
episode. It should be noted that ICD-10 codes are
not used in the query in any of the experiments.
Closer inspection shows that the free text con-
tent in care episodes with the same ICD-10 code
is indeed quite similar in many cases, but not al-
ways. Considering all of them equally similar
amounts to an arguably coarse approximation of
relevance. The second alternative tries to remedy
this issue by measuring the similarity between dis-

charge summaries. That is, if the discharge sum-
mary of a retrieved episode is semantically simi-
lar to the discharge summary of the query episode,
the retrieved episode is assumed to be correct.
In practice, textual similarity between discharge
summaries, and therefore the relevance score, is
continuous rather than binary. It is measured using
the same models of distributional semantics used
for retrieval, which will be described in Section 4.
It should be stressed that the discharge summaries
are not taken into consideration during retrieval in
any of the experiments and are only used for eval-
uation.

4.1 Semantic models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994965">
A crucial part in retrieving similar care episodes
is having a good similarity measure. Here similar-
ity between care episodes is measured as the sim-
ilarity between the words they contain (see Sec-
tion 4.2). Semantic similarity between words is in
turn measured through the use of word space mod-
els (WSM), without performing an explicit query
expansion step. Several variants of these models
were tested, utilizing different techniques and pa-
rameters for building them. The models trained
and tested in this paper are: (1) classic random
indexing with a sliding window using term in-
dex vectors and term context vectors (RI-Word);
(2) random indexing with index vectors for doc-
uments (RI-Doc); (3) random indexing with in-
dex vectors for ICD-10 codes (RI-ICD); (4) a ver-
sion of random indexing where only the term in-
dex vectors are used (RI-Index); and (5) a seman-
tic neural network model, using word2vec to build
word context vectors (Word2vec).

RI-Word
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985535952380952">
Random Indexing (RI) (Kanerva et al., 2000) is
a method for building a (pre) compressed WSM
with a fixed dimensionality, done in an incremen-
tal fashion. RI consist of the following two steps:
First, instead of allocating one dimension in the
multidimensional vector space to a single word,
each word is assigned an “index vector” as its
unique signature in the vector space. Index vectors
are generated vectors consisting of mostly zeros
together with a randomly distributed set of several
1’s and -1’s, uniquely distributed for each unique
word; The second step is to induce “context vec-
tors” for each word. A context vector represents
the contextual meaning of a word in the WSM.
This is done using a sliding window of a fixed size
to traverse a training corpus, inducing context vec-
tors for the center/target word of the sliding win-
dow by summing the index vectors of the neigh-
bouring words in the window.
As the dimensionality of the index vectors is
fixed, the dimensionality of the vector space will
not grow beyond the size W × Dim, where W is
the number of unique words in the vocabulary, and
Dim being the pre-selected dimensionality to use
for the index vectors. As a result, RI models are
significantly smaller than plain word space mod-
els, making them a lot less computationally expen-
sive. Additionally, the method is fully incremental
(additional training data can be added at any given
time without having to retrain the existing model),
easy to parallelize, and scalable, meaning that it is
fast and can be trained on large amounts of text in
an on-line fashion.
RI-Doc
Contrary to sliding window approach used in RI-
Word, a RI model built with document index vec-
tors first assigns unique index vectors to every
document in the training corpus. In the training
phase, each word in a document get the respective
document vector added to its context vector. The
resulting WSM is thus a compressed version of a
term-by-document matrix.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.825788" genericHeader="method">
RI-ICD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999545">
Based on the principle of RI with document index
vectors, we here explore a novel way of construct-
ing a WSM by exploiting the ICD-10 code classi-
fication done by clinicians. Instead of using doc-
ument index vectors, we here use ICD-code index
vectors. First, a unique index vector is assigned to
each chapter and sub-chapter in the ICD-10 taxon-
omy. This means assigning a unique index vector
to each “node” in the ICD-10 taxonomy, as illus-
trated in Figure 2. For each clinical note in the
training corpus, the index vector of the their pri-
mary ICD-10 code is added to all words within it.
In addition, all the index vectors for the ICD-codes
higher in the taxonomy are added, each weighted
according to their position in the hierarchy. A
weight of 1 is given to the full code, while the
weight is halved for each step upwards in the hi-
erarchy. The motivation for the latter is to capture
a certain degree of similarity between codes that
share an initial path in the taxonomy. As a result,

vectors when training WSMs based on ICD-10
codes (RI-ICD).
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.990767625">
this similarity is encoded in the resulting WSM.
As a example: for a clinical note labelled with the
code J21.1, we add the following index vectors
to the context vectors of all its constituting words:
iv(J) x 0.125, iv(J2) x 0.25, iv(J21) x 0.5 and
iv(J21.1) x 1.0. The underlying hypothesis for
building a WSM in this way is that it may cap-
ture relations between words in a way that bet-
ter reflects the clinical domain, compared to the
other domain-independent methods for construct-
ing a WSM.
RI-Index
As an alternative to using word’s (semantic) con-
text vectors, we simply only use their index vec-
tors as their “contextual meaning”. When con-
structing document vectors directly from word in-
dex vectors (see Section 4.2), the resulting docu-
ment vectors represent a compressed version of a
document-by-term matrix.
Word2vec
Recently, a novel method for inducing WSMs was
introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013a), stemming
from the research in deep learning and neural net-
work language models. While the overall objec-
tive of learning a continuous vector space repre-
sentation for each word based on its textual con-
text remains, the underlying algorithms are sub-
stantially different from traditional methods such
as Latent Semantic Analysis and RI. Considering,
in turn, every word in the training data as a target
word, the method induces the representations by
training a simplified neural network to predict the
nearby context words of each target word (skip-
gram architecture), or alternatively the target word
based on all words in its immediate context (BoW
architecture). The vector space representation is
subsequently extracted from the learned weights
within the neural network. One of the main prac-
tical advantages of the word2vec method lies in
its scalability, allowing quick training on large
amounts of text, setting it apart from the majority
of other methods of distributional semantics. Ad-
ditionally, the word2vec method has been shown
to produce representations that surpass in quality
traditional methods such as Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis, especially on tasks measuring the preserva-
tion of important linguistic regularities (Mikolov
et al., 2013b).

4.2 Computing care episode similarity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999516">
After having computed a WSM, the next step is
to build episode vectors to use for the actual re-
trieval task. This is done by first normalizing the
word vectors and multiplying them with a word’s
TF*IDF weight. An episode vector is then ob-
tained by summing the word vectors of all its
words and dividing the result by the total num-
ber of words in the episode. Similarity between
episodes is determined by computing the cosine
similarity between their vectors.

Two baselines were used in this study. The first
one is random retrieval of care episodes, which
can be expected to give very low scores and serves
merely as a sanity check. The second one is
Apache Lucene (Cutting, 1999), a state-of-the-art
search engine based on look-up of similar docu-
ments through a reverse index and relevance rank-
ing based on a TF*IDF-weighted vector space
model. Care episodes were indexed using Lucene.
Similar to the other models/methods, all of the free
text in the query episode, excluding the discharge
summary, served as the query string provided to
Lucene. Being a state-of-the-art IR system, the
scores achieved by Lucene in these experiments
should indicate the difficulty of the task.

ical notes are split into sentences, tokenized, and
lemmatized using a Constraint-Grammar based
morphological analyzer and tagger extended with
clinical vocabulary (Karlsson, 1995). After stop
words were removed1, the total training corpus
contained 39 million words (minus the query
episodes), while the evaluation subset contained
18.5 million words. The vocabulary consisted of
0.6 million unique terms. Twenty care episodes
were randomly selected to serve as the query
episodes during testing, with the requirement that
each had different ICD-10 codes and consisted of a
minimum of six clinical notes. The average num-
ber of words per query episode is 830.
RI-based and word2vec models have a prede-
fined dimensionality of 800. For RI-based mod-
els, 4 non-zeros were used in the index vectors.
For the RI-Word model, a narrow context win-
dow was employed (5 left + 5 right), weighting
index vectors according to their distance to the tar-
get word (weightz = 21−dzstit). In addition, the
index vectors were shifted once left or right de-
pending on what side of the target word they were
located, similar to direction vectors as described
in (Sahlgren et al., 2008) These parameters for RI
were chosen based on previous work on semantic
textual similarity (Moen et al., 2013). Also a much
larger window of 20+20 was tested, but without
noteworthy improvements. The word2vec model
is trained with the BoW architecture and otherwise
default parameters. In addition to Apache Lucene
(version 4.2.0)2, the word2vec tool3 was used to
train the word2vec model, and the RI-based meth-
ods utilized the JavaSDM package4. Scores were
calculated using the trec eval tool5.

have to be chosen. This procedure thus resulted in
six different test collections, each consisting of 20
query episodes with their corresponding 100 most
similar collection episodes.
Subsequently a 6-by-6 experimental design was
followed where each retrieval method was tested
against each test set construction method. At re-
trieval time, for each query episode, the system re-
trieves and ranks 1000 care episodes. It can be ex-
pected that when identical methods are used for re-

trieval and test set construction, the resulting bias
gives rise to relatively high scores. In contrast,
averaging over the scores for all six construction
methods is assumed to be a less biased indicator
of performance.
Table 2 shows the number of correctly retrieved
episodes by the different models, with the maxi-
mum being 2000 (20 queries times 100 most sim-
ilar episodes). This gives an indication of the re-
call among a 1000 retrieved episodes per query,
but without caring about precision or ranking. In
general, the numbers are relatively good when the
same model is used for both retrieval and construc-
tion of the test set (cf. values on the diagonal), al-
though in a couple of cases (e.g. with word2vec)
results are better with different models. The RI-
ICD model performs best when used for both re-
trieval and test construction. Looking at the av-
erages, which presumably are less biased indica-
tors, RI-ICD and word2vec seem to have compa-
rable performance, with both of them outperform-
ing Lucene. Other models are less successful, al-
though still much better than the random baseline.
The MAP scores in Table 3 show similar re-
sults, although here RI-ICD yields the best aver-
age score. Both models RI-ICD and word2vec
outperform Lucene. Again the RI-ICD model per-
forms exceptionally well when used for both re-
trieval and test construction.
Finally Table 4 presents precision for top-10 re-
trieved care episodes. Here RI-Doc yields the best
average scores, while RI-ICD and word2vec both
perform slightly worse.

<bodyText confidence="0.999987384615385">
The goal of the experiments was primarily to
determine which distributional semantic models
work best for care episode retrieval. The exper-
imental results show that several models outper-
form Lucene at the care episode retrieval task.
This suggests that models of higher order seman-
tics contribute positively to calculating document
similarities in the clinical domain, compared with
straight forward boolean word matching (cf. RI-
Index and Lucene).
The relatively good performance of the RI-ICD
model, particularly in Experiment 1, suggests that
exploiting structured or encoded information in
building semantic models for clinical NLP is a
promising direction that calls for further investi-
gation. This approach concurs with the arguments
in favor of reuse of existing information sources
in Friedman et al. (2013). On the one hand, it
may not be surprising that the RI-ICD model is
performing well on Experiment 1, given how it in-
duces semantic relations between words occurring
in episodes with the same ICD-10 code. On the
other hand, being able to accurately retrieve care
episodes with similar ICD-10 codes evidently has
practical value from a clinical perspective.
The different ranking of models in experiments
1 versus 2 confirms that there is a difference be-
tween the two indicators of episode similarity,
i.e. similarity in terms of their ICD-10 codes
versus similarity with regard to their discharge
summaries. In our data a single care episode
can potentially span across several hospital wards.
A better correlation between the similarity mea-
sures is to be expected when narrowing the def-
inition of a care episode to only a single ward.
Also, taking into consideration all ICD-10 codes
for care episodes – not only the primary one –
could potentially improve discrimination among
care episodes. This could be useful in two ways:
(1) to create more precise test sets of the type used
in Experiment 1; (2) to extend RI-ICD models
with index vectors also for the secondary ICD-10
codes.
Input to the models for training was limited to
the free text in the clinical notes, with the ex-
ception of the use of ICD-10 codes in the RI-
ICD model. Other sources of information could,
and probably should, be utilized in a practical
care episode retrieval system applied in a hospi-
tal, such as the structured and coded information
commonly found in EHR systems. Another po-
tential information source is the internal structure
of the care episodes, as episodes containing sim-
ilar notes in the same sequential order are intu-
itively more likely to be similar. We tried comput-
ing exhaustive pairwise similarities between the
individual notes from two episodes and then tak-
ing the average of these as a similarity measure
for the episodes. However, this did not improve
performance on any measure. An alternative ap-
proach may be to apply sequence alignment algo-
rithms, as commonly used in bioinformatics (Gus-
field, 1997), in order to detect if both episodes
contain similar notes in the same temporal order.
We leave this to future work.

In this paper we proposed the task of care episode
retrieval as a way of evaluating several distribu-
tional semantic models in their performance at IR.
As manually constructing a proper test set of clas-
sified care episodes is costly, we experimented
with building test sets by exploiting either ICD-10
code overlap or semantic similarity of discharge
summaries. A novel method for generating se-
mantic models utilizing the ICD-10 codes of care
episodes in the training corpus was presented (RI-
ICD). The models, as well as the Lucene search
engine, were applied to the care episode retrieval
task and their performance was evaluated against
the test sets using different evaluation measures.
The results suggest that the RI-ICD model is bet-
ter suited to IR tasks in the clinical domain com-
pared with models trained on local distributions of
words, or those relying on direct word matching.
The word2vec model performed relatively well
and outperformed Lucene in both experiments.
In the results reported here, the internal se-
quence of clinical notes is ignored. Future work
should focus on exploring the temporal (sub-) se-
quence similarities between care episode pairs for
doing care episode retrieval. Further work should
also focus on expanding on the RI-ICD method
by exploiting other types of structured and/or en-
coded information related to clinical notes for
training semantic models tailored for NLP in the
clinical domain.

This is done by first normalizing the word vectors and multiplying them with a word’s TF*IDF weight. An episode vector is then obtained by summing the word vectors of all its words and dividing the result by the total number of words in the episode. Similarity between episodes is determined by computing the cosine similarity between their vectors. 4.3 Baselines Two baselines were used in this study. The first one is random retrieval of care episodes, which can be expected to give very low scores and serves merely as a sanity check. The second one is Apache Lucene (Cutting, 1999), a state-of-the-art search engine based on look-up of similar documents through a reverse index and relevance ranking based on a TF*IDF-weighted vector space model. Care episodes were indexed using Lucene. Similar to the other models/methods, all of the free text in the query episode, excluding the discharge summary, served as the query string provided to Lucene. Being a state-of-the-art IR system, the scores achieved by Lucene in these experiments should indicate the difficulty of the task. 5 Experiments In these experiments we strove to have a setup that was as comparable as possible for al</context>

For instance, it could enable researchers to map or cluster similar care episodes to find common symptoms or conditions. In sum, care episode retrieval is likely to improve care quality and consistency in hospitals. From the perspective of NLP, care episode retrieval – and IR from EHRs in general – is a challenging task. It differs from general-purpose web search in that the vocabulary, the information needs and the queries of clinicians are highly specialised (Yang et al., 2011). Clinical notes contain highly domain-specific terminology (Rector, 1999; Friedman et al., 2002; Allvin et al., 2010) and generic text processing resources are therefore often suboptimal or inadequate (Shatkay, 2005). At the same time, development of dedicated clinical NLP tools and resources is often difficult and costly. For example, popular data-driven approaches to NLP are based on supervised learning, which requires substantial amounts of tailored training data, typically built through manual annotation by annotators who need both linguistic and clinical knowledge.

Additionally, variations in the language and terminology used in sub-domains within and across health care organisations greatly limit the scope of applicability of such training data (Rector, 1999). Recent work has shown that distributional models of semantics, induced in an unsupervised manner from large corpora of clinical and/or medical text, are well suited as a resource-light approach to capturing and representing domain-specific terminology (Pedersen et al., 2007; Koopman et al., 2012; Henriksson et al., 2014). This raises the question to what extent distributional models of semantics can alleviate the aforementioned problems of NLP in the clinical domain. The work reported here investigates to what extent distributional models of semantics, built from a corpus of clinical text in an fully unsupervised manner, can be used for care episode retrieval. Models include several variants of random indexing and a semantic neural network model called word2vec, which will be described in more detail in Section 4.

The models trained and tested in this paper are: (1) classic random indexing with a sliding window using term index vectors and term context vectors (RI-Word); (2) random indexing with index vectors for documents (RI-Doc); (3) random indexing with index vectors for ICD-10 codes (RI-ICD); (4) a version of random indexing where only the term index vectors are used (RI-Index); and (5) a semantic neural network model, using word2vec to build word context vectors (Word2vec). RI-Word Random Indexing (RI) (Kanerva et al., 2000) is a method for building a (pre) compressed WSM with a fixed dimensionality, done in an incremental fashion. RI consist of the following two steps: First, instead of allocating one dimension in the multidimensional vector space to a single word, each word is assigned an “index vector” as its unique signature in the vector space. Index vectors are generated vectors consisting of mostly zeros together with a randomly distributed set of several 1’s and -1’s, uniquely distributed for each unique word; The second step is to induce “context vectors” for each word. A context vector represents the co</context>

For the RI-Word model, a narrow context window was employed (5 left + 5 right), weighting index vectors according to their distance to the target word (weightz = 21−dzstit). In addition, the index vectors were shifted once left or right depending on what side of the target word they were located, similar to direction vectors as described in (Sahlgren et al., 2008) These parameters for RI were chosen based on previous work on semantic textual similarity (Moen et al., 2013).

IR has become a crucial technology for many organisations that deal with vast amounts of partly structured and unstructured (free text) data stored in electronic format, including hospitals and other health care providers. IR is an essential part of the clinical practice; e.g., on-line IR systems are associated with substantial improvements in clinicians decision-making concerning clinical problems (Westbrook et al., 2005). The different stages of the clinical care of a patient are documented in clinical care notes, consisting mainly of free text. A care episode consists of a sequence of individual clinical care notes, concluded by a discharge summary, as illustrated in Figure 1. Care episodes are stored in electronic format in electronic health record (EHR) systems. These systems are used throughout the health care sector by patients, administrators and professionals from different areas, primarily for clinical purposes, but also for secondary purposes such as decision support and research (H¨ayrinen et al., 2</context>

This suggests that models of higher order semantics contribute positively to calculating document similarities in the clinical domain, compared with straight forward boolean word matching (cf. RIIndex and Lucene). The relatively good performance of the RI-ICD model, particularly in Experiment 1, suggests that exploiting structured or encoded information in building semantic models for clinical NLP is a promising direction that calls for further investigation. This approach concurs with the arguments in favor of reuse of existing information sources in Friedman et al. (2013). On the one hand, it may not be surprising that the RI-ICD model is performing well on Experiment 1, given how it induces semantic relations between words occurring in episodes with the same ICD-10 code. On the other hand, being able to accurately retrieve care episodes with similar ICD-10 codes evidently has practical value from a clinical perspective. The different ranking of models in experiments 1 versus 2 confirms that there is a difference between the two indicators of episode similarity, i.e. similarity in terms of their ICD-10 codes versus similarity with regard to their discharge sum</context>

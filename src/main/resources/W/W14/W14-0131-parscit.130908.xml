In this paper a tool to manage a dataset for a
VerbNet-like verb lexicon is presented. It was
designed to allow users to create a verb lexi-
con for another language than English and at
the same time use the same data structure as
the English VerbNet. We take a look at the
most relevant requirements of the software
and will give an overview of the functionality
achieved so far.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998608">
In 2000 the verb lexicon for English was created
by scientist from the University of Pennsylvania
and named as VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000). The
following work has extended the content of the
verb lexicon with many new verbs and verb clas-
ses (Kipper et al., 2006). Today in the English
VerbNet version 3.2 there are 273 total main
classes and 214 total subclasses with 6340 total
verbs covered (Unified Verb Index, 2013).
Several works have shown that the VerbNet is
very useful for NLP but till now a resource of
this size and coverage exists only for English.
There is no questions that similar verb lexicons
for others languages are needed.
In recent work the question was asked - is it
feasible to convert the English Verbnet into a
similar verb lexicon for some other language and
the following analysis for Estonian showed that
in principle the class hierarchy, thematic roles
with restrictions and semantic descriptions are
reusable for such work (Jentson, 2013).
In order to start building a new verb lexicon
for Estonian side-by-side with the English Verb-
Net the appropriate tool - VerbNet Workbench -
was designed and implemented.

2 Requirements for the VerbNet Work-
bench
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978341666666667">
In order to understand exactly what kind of soft-
ware is required to manage VerbNet data the
most essential functional requirements (FR) were
specified.
FR1. The system shall allow each user to
choose a target language for the following work
session.
FR1.1. The system shall allow an authenticat-
ed user to add a new language to the list of avail-
able languages.
FR2. The system must be completely compat-
ible with the data structure of the English Verb-
Net.
FR2.1. The system shall allow to import the
VerbNet data files for the selected language in
XML format correspondent to XML schema
vn_schema-3.xsd (VerbNet, 2013).
FR2.2. The system shall allow to export the
VerbNet data files for the selected language in
XML format with the XML scheme file con-
sistent to the exported data.
FR3. The system shall allow an authenticated
user to enter the following information in the
context of the selected language:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.970901071428572">
1) the general data for a verb class together
with a reference to the corresponding
verb class in the English VerbNet;
2) the members of the verb class together
with the references to the other language
resources (for example the WordNet, the
FrameNet etc);
3) the thematic roles with the selection re-
strictions for the arguments of the verb
class;
4) the syntactic frames of the verb class,
each containing an example, a syntactic
template with the syntactic restrictions
and a semantic description;
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994113857142857">
5) the subclasses of the verb class, they are
with the same structure as the main class.
FR3.1. The system shall allow an authenticat-
ed user to insert new selection restrictions with
the descriptions for the thematic roles.
FR3.2. The system shall allow an authenticat-
ed user to insert new syntactic restrictions with
the descriptions.
FR3.3. The system shall allow an authenticat-
ed user to insert new predicates with the descrip-
tions for the semantic descriptions.
FR4. The system shall allow an authenticated
user to reserve a verb class for his/her work and
publish the changed data only after the work is
marked completed.
FR4.1. The system shall show to an authenti-
cated user the list of verb classes reserved by that
user.
FR4.2. The system shall prevent a user from
reserving some verb class that is already re-
served.
FR5. The system shall maintain all versions of
the records for every verb class.
FR6. The system shall allow each user to
search the verbs from the lexicon and list all the
references to those verb classes where the verb is
in the list of members.
In the process of designing and implementing
the VerbNet Workbench software all those re-
quirements were taken into account. From the
non-functional requirements we highlight only
one - the targeted system must be web-based in
order to ensure its availability to all interested
parties and to allow many linguists to work to-
gether on the VerbNet data.

3 Results: overview of functionality
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926481481482">
In order to build the VerbNet Workbench we
used the programming language Python 2.7
(2013) and the web application framework Djan-
go (Django Project, 2013). For data storage the
database management system PostgreSQL 9.2
(2013) is used, but it is possible to use any rela-
tional database system supported by Django.
The UML class diagram of the necessary data
model is presented on Figure 1. The main data
object on the diagram is class VIClass the pur-
pose of which is to hold data for the verb classes
in the context of the chosen language. The list of
verbs (class Member), thematic roles (class The-
maticRole) and syntactic frames (class Frame)
belongs to each verb class. For each syntactic
frame, there is a data structure to describe the
template (class Syntax etc) and the meaning
(class Semantics etc) of the sentence.
In Table 1 there is a short overview of the
functionality which is available to the users. Ac-
cess to that functionality is divided between three
user roles. The role ‘User’ belongs to any unau-
thenticated user who wants to use the prepared
data. An authenticated user gets the role ‘Con-
tributor’ and can additionally do everything that
‘User’ can do and the user with the role ‘Admin-
istrator’ has rights to do everything.

The usual scenario for entering new infor-
mation to the database includes activities like
choosing some verb class from the English
VerbNet, entering an appropriate name for this
verb class in the chosen working language, find-
ing the class members (this can be started by
translating the verbs in the same verb class of the

English VerbNet) and defining the syntactic
frames. Defining all suitable syntactic templates
with the syntactic restrictions for the selected
verb class is indeed the most challenging work in
this process because there lay the main differ-
ences when we are looking from the point of
view of another language.
This basic functionality allows linguists to
start collecting information about the verbs for
many different languages so that the data struc-
ture of the gathered information is compatible
with the English VerbNet and the verb classes
from one language are comparable to the verb
classes from some other language.

download data already collected. However, it is
also observed that some advanced features would
be helpful for data entry, enabling the necessary
data type values to be selected and the amount of
manual input reduced.
Referencing from the submitted data to other
resources for the same language is currently im-
plemented only on the description level. Func-
tionality, which allows opening and viewing ref-
erenced resources such as Wordnet or Framenet,
is depending on availability and access methods
of each specific resource and the general ap-
proach is therefore complicated to implement.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966125">
It can be concluded that the main use cases with
basic functionality are indeed realized, but more
work is necessary in order to increase usability
and user comfort. It is also planned to enable a
localization of the application in order to provide
the users with the possibility to use a preferred
language for the user interface. A separate issue
is drafting the user manual to give substantive
guidelines for categorizing verbs and to explain
the basic principles and the rules about compil-
ing a verb class dataset.
We hope that the availability of the VerbNet
Workbench will propitiate work on verb seman-
tics and give the possibility to create a useful
language resource for natural language pro-
cessing in many languages.

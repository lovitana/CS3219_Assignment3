Assuming that collaboration between
theoretical and computational linguistics is
essential in projects aimed at developing
language resources like annotated corpora, this
paper presents the first steps of the semantic
annotation of the Index Thomisticus Treebank,
a dependency-based treebank of Medieval
Latin. The semantic layer of annotation of the
treebank is detailed and the theoretical

<bodyText confidence="0.999922577777778">
Started in 1949 by father Roberto Busa SJ, the
Index Thomisticus (IT; Busa, 1974-1980) has
represented a groundbreaking project that laid
the foundations of computational linguistics and
literary computing. The IT is a morphologically
tagged and lemmatized corpus of Medieval Latin
containing the opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas
(118 texts), as well as 61 texts by other authors
related to Thomas, for a total of around 11
million tokens.
The Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB:
http://itreebank.marginalia.it) is the syntactically
annotated portion of the IT. Presently, the IT-TB
includes around 220,000 nodes (approximately,
12,000 sentences).
The project of the IT-TB is now entering a
new phase aimed at enhancing the available
syntactic annotation with semantic metadata.
Starting such a task needs to choose a theoretical
approach and framework that supports the
annotation style. Indeed, performing linguistic
annotation of a textual corpus should be strictly
connected to fundamental issues in theoretical
linguistics in a kind of virtuous circle. On its
side, theoretical linguistics serves as the
necessary backbone for solid annotation
guidelines; no theory-neutral representation of a
sentence is possible, since every representation
style needs a theory to extract its meaning. On
the other hand, applying a theoretical framework
to real data makes it possible to empirically test
and possibly refine it. According to Eva
Hajicová, “corpus annotation serves, among
other things, as an invaluable test for the
linguistic theories standing behind the annotation
schemes, and as such represents an irreplaceable
resource of linguistic information for the
construction and enrichment of grammars, both
formal and theoretical” (Hajicová, 2006: 466).
Further, the task of developing language
resources like annotated corpora supports
interaction between intuition-based and corpus-
based/-driven approaches in theoretical
linguistics (Tognini-Bonelli, 2001). No intuition-
based grammar is able to manage all the possible

background (section 2) and then sampling a
number of specific aspects of annotation (section

2 The Theoretical Background of the
Index Thomisticus Treebank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817197368421">
Hosted at the CIRCSE research centre of the
Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan,
Italy (http://centridiricerca.unicatt.it/circse), the
IT-TB is a dependency-based treebank
(McGillivray et al., 2009). The choice of a
representation framework alone does not
determine the representation for a given
sentence, as there can be many (correct)
dependency-based (as well as constituency-
based) trees for even simple sentences. Thus, a
fine-grained linguistic theory must be selected to
support the specific aspects raised by a large-
scale annotation of real data. In this respect, the
annotation style of the IT-TB is based on
Functional Generative Description (FGD; Sgall
et al., 1986), a dependency-based theoretical
framework developed in Prague and intensively
applied and tested while building the Prague
Dependency Treebank of Czech (PDT).
FGD is rooted in Praguian structuralism-
functionalism dating back to the 30s, one
assumption of which is the stratificational
approach to sentence analysis pursued by
Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), a
linguistic theory developed by Jan Firbas in the
mid-1950s on the basis of Vilém Mathesius’
work (Firbas, 1992). According to FSP, the
sentence is conceived as: (a) a singular and
individual speech event [utterance-event]; (b)
one of the possible different minimal
communicative units (means) of the given
language [form]; (c) an abstract structure (a
pattern) [meaning].
Considering language as a form-meaning
composite is a basic assumption also of FGD,
which is particularly focused on the last point
above, aiming at the description of the so-called
‘underlying syntax’ of the sentence. Underlying
syntax (the meaning) is separated from (but still
connected with) surface syntax (the form) and
represents the linguistic (literal) meaning of the
sentence, which is described through dependency
tree-graphs.
This approach is consistent with the functional
and pragmatic analysis of language pursued by
the Prague Linguistic Circle since its very
beginning, along the so-called ‘first period’ of
the Circle (Raynaud, 2008). Language is
conceived as “un système de moyens
d’expression appropriés à un but” (“a system of
purposive means”; Cercle linguistique de Prague,
1929: 7). The “moyens d’expression” correspond
to the ‘form’ (surface syntax), while the fact that
they are “appropriés à un but” corresponds to the
‘meaning’ (underlying syntax).
The description of surface and underlying
syntax in FGD is dependency-based mostly
because dependency grammars are predicate-
focused grammars. This enables FGD to face one
of the basic statements of the Prague Linguistic
Circle: “l’acte syntagmatique fondamental [...]
est la prédication” (“the basic syntagmatic act is
predication”; Cercle linguistique de Prague,
1929: 13). Further, during the second period of
the theory of predication pursued by the Circle,
while accounting for the three-level approach to
sentence in FSP, Daneš claims that “[t]he kernel
syntactic relation is that of dependance” (Daneš,
1964: 227) and stresses the strict connection
holding between form and meaning: “we are
convinced that the interrelations of both levels,
semantic and grammatical must necessarily be
stated in order to give a full account of an overall
linguistic system” (Daneš, 1964: 226).
Consistently with such a theoretical
background, the PDT (as well as the IT-TB) is a
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.96796188764045">
dependency-based treebank with a three-layer
structure, in which each layer corresponds to one
of the three views of sentence mentioned above
(Hajic et al., 2000). The layers are ordered as
follows:
- a morphological layer: morphological
tagging and lemmatization;
- an ‘analytical’ layer (i.e. the presently
available layer of annotation of the IT-
TB): annotation of surface syntax;
- a ‘tectogrammatical’ layer: annotation of
underlying syntax.
The development of each layer requires the
availability of the previous one(s). Both the
analytical and the tectogrammatical layers
describe the sentence structure with dependency
tree-graphs, respectively named analytical tree
structures (ATSs) and tectogrammatical tree
structures (TGTSs).
In ATSs every word and punctuation mark of
the sentence is represented by a node of a rooted
dependency tree. The edges of the tree
correspond to dependency relations that are
labelled with (surface) syntactic functions called
‘analytical functions’ (like Subject, Object etc.).
TGTSs describe the underlying structure of
the sentence, conceived as the semantically
relevant counterpart of the grammatical means of
expression (described by ATSs). The nodes of
TGTSs represent autosemantic words only, while
function words and punctuation marks are left
out. The nodes are labeled with semantic role
tags called ‘functors’. These are divided into two
classes according to valency: (a) arguments,
called ‘inner participants’, i.e. obligatory
complementations of verbs, nouns, adjectives
and adverbs: Actor, Patient, Addressee, Effect
and Origin; (b) adjuncts, called ‘free
modifications’: different kinds of adverbials, like
Place, Time, Manner etc.. The ‘dialogue test’ by
Panevová (1974-1975) is used as the guiding
criterion for obligatoriness. TGTSs feature two
dimensions that represent respectively the
syntactic structure of the sentence (the vertical
dimension) and its information structure (‘topic-
focus articulation’, TFA), based on the
underlying word order (the horizontal
dimension). In FGD, TFA deals with the
opposition between contextual boundness (the
‘given’ information, on the left) and contextual
unboundness (the ‘new’ information, on the
right). Also ellipsis resolution and coreferential
analysis are performed at the tectogrammatical
layer and are represented in TGTSs through
newly added nodes (ellipsis) and arrows
(coreference).
Since its beginning, the IT-TB has been
following the PDT annotation style for both
typological and structural reasons. As far as the
former are concerned, Latin and Czech share
certain relevant properties, such as being richly
inflected, showing discontinuous phrases, and
having a moderately free word-order and a high
degree of synonymity and ambiguity of the
endings. Both languages have three genders
(masculine, feminine, neuter), cases with roughly
the same meaning and no articles. As for the
latter, the tight connection between the three-
layer structure of the PDT and a sound
background theory like FGD integrates each
layer of annotation into a more general
framework driven by a functional perspective
aimed at understanding the underlying meaning
of sentences through its relation with the surface
form. Moreover, tectogrammatical annotation
includes several pragmatic aspects that, although
much present in Latin linguistics research, are
still missing from the available treebanks of
Latin1.
The organization of functors into inner
participants and free modifications is further
exploited by linking textual tectogrammatical
annotation with fundamental lexical information
1 Some semantic-pragmatic annotation of Latin texts
is available only in the PROIEL corpus (Haug &amp;
Jøndal, 2008). The Latin subset of PROIEL includes
Classical texts from the 1st century BC (Caesar,
Cicero), the Peregrinatio Aetheriae and the New
Testament by Jerome (both from the 5th century AD).

provided by a valency lexicon that features the
valency frame(s) for all those verbs, nouns,
adjectives and adverbs capable of valency that
occur in the treebank. The valency lexicon of the
IT-TB is being built in a corpus-driven fashion,
by adding to the lexicon all the valency-capable
words that annotators progressively get through2.

<bodyText confidence="0.959162147058824">
As the tectogrammatical annotation of the IT-TB
has just started and no Latin texts annotated at
the tectogrammatical layer are available yet, we
cannot train and use probabilistic NLP tools to
build TGTSs. Thus, the annotation workflow is
based on TGTSs automatically converted from
ATSs. The TGTSs that result from conversion
are then checked and refined manually by two
independent annotators. Conversion is performed
by adapting to Latin a number of ATS-to-TGTS
scripts provided by the NLP framework Treex
developed in Prague (Popel and Žabokrtský,
2010). Relying on ATSs, the basic functions of
these scripts are: (a) to collapse ATSs nodes of
function words and punctuation marks, as they
no longer receive a node for themselves in
TGTSs, but are included into the autosemantic
nodes; (b) to assign basic functors (such as Actor
and Patient); (c) to assign ‘grammatemes’, i.e.
semantic counterparts of morphological
categories (for instance, pluralia tantum are
tagged with the number grammateme ‘singular’).
The annotation guidelines are those for the
tectogrammatical layer of the PDT (Mikulová et
al., 2006).
In the following, three examples of
tectogrammatical annotation of sentences taken
from the IT-TB are reported and discussed in
detail.
2 A syntactic-based valency lexicon of the IT-TB
(named IT-VaLex) was induced automatically from
the analytical layer of the treebank and made available
on-line (http://itreebank.marginalia.it/itvalex)
(McGillivray and Passarotti, 2009).

Figure 1 reports the ATS of the following
sentence of the IT-TB: “tunc enim unaquaeque
res optime disponitur cum ad finem suum
convenienter ordinatur;” (“So, each thing is
excellently arranged when it is properly directed
to its purpose;”, Summa contra Gentiles 1.1).

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994115">
Except for the technical root of the tree
(holding the textual reference of the sentence),
each node in the ATS corresponds to one word
or punctuation mark in the sentence. Nodes are
arranged from left to right according to surface
word-order. They are connected in governor-
dependent fashion and each relation is labelled
with an analytical function. For instance, the
relation between the word res and its governor
disponitur is labelled with the analytical function
Sb (Subject), i.e. res is the subject of disponitur.
Four kinds of analytical functions that occur in
the tree are assigned to auxiliary sentence
members, namely AuxC (subordinating
conjunctions: cum), AuxK (terminal punctuation
marks), AuxP (prepositions: ad) and AuxY
(sentence adverbs: enim, tunc). The other
analytical functions occurring in this sentences
are the following: Atr (attributes), Adv (adverbs
and adverbial modifications, i.e. adjuncts), AuxS

(root of the tree), Obj (direct and indirect
objects), Pred (main predicate of the sentence).

<bodyText confidence="0.999923947368421">
As only autosemantic nodes can occur in
TGTSs, auxiliary sentence members labelled
with AuxC, AuxK, or AuxP are collapsed.
Analytical functions are replaced with
functors. The nodes of the lemmas tunc and enim
are both assigned the functor PREC, since they
represent expressions linking the clause to the
preceding context; further, tunc and enim are
given nodetype ‘atom’ (atomic nodes), which is
used for adverbs of attitude, intensifying or
modal expressions, rhematizers and text
connectives (which is the case of tunc and enim)
(Mikulová et al., 2006: 17). Res is the Patient
(PAT) of dispono, as it is the syntactic subject of
a passive verbal form (disponitur)4. Both the
adverbial forms of bonus (optime) and convenio
(convenienter) are labelled with functor MANN,
which expresses manner by specifying an
evaluating characteristic of the event, or a

<tableCaption confidence="0.561735">
3 In the default visualization of TGTSs, wordforms
are replaced with lemmas.
4 Conversely, syntactic subjects of active verbal forms
are usually labelled with the functor ACT (Actor).
However, this does not always hold true, since the
functor of the subject depends on the semantic
features of the verb.

property. Unusquisque is a pronominal restrictive
adnominal modification (RSTR) that further
specifies the governing noun res. The clause
headed by ordinatur (lemma: ordino; analytical
function: Adv) is assigned the functor COND, as
it reports the condition on which the event
expressed by the governing verb (disponitur;
lemma: dispono) can happen. The lemma finis is
assigned the functor DIR3 (Directional: to),
which expresses the target point of the event.
Finis is then specified by an adnominal
modification of appurtenance (APP).
Three newly added nodes occur in the tree
(square nodes), to provide ellipsis resolution of
those arguments of the verbs dispono and ordino
that are missing in the surface structure. Dispono
is a two-argument verb (the two arguments being
respectively the Actor and the Patient), but only
the Patient is explicitly expressed in the sentence,
i.e. the syntactic subject res. The missing
argument, i.e. the Actor (ACT), is thus replaced
with a ‘general argument’ (#Gen), because the
coreferred element of the omitted modification
cannot be clearly identified, even with the help
of the context. The same holds also for the Actor
of the verb ordino (#Gen), whose Patient
(#PersPron, PAT) is coreferential with the noun
res, as well as the possessive adjective suus
(#PersPron, APP). In the TGTS, these
coreferential relations are shown by the blue
arrows that link the two #PersPron nodes with
the node of res. #PersPron is a ‘t-lemma’
(tectogrammatical lemma) assigned to nodes
representing possessive and personal pronouns
(including reflexives).
The nodes in the TGTS are arranged from left
to right according to TFA, which is signalled by
the colour of the nodes (white nodes: topic;
yellow nodes: focus) A so-called ‘semantic part
of speech’ is assigned to each node: for instance,
‘denotational noun’ is assigned to finis. Finally,
the illocutionary force class informing about the
sentential modality is assigned to the main
predicate of the sentence dispono (‘enunciative’).

In addition to the analytical functions assigned
to auxiliary sentence members in the tree of
figure 1, this tree features one occurrence of
AuxZ (particles that emphasize a specific
sentence member) and two of AuxX (commas).
Figure 4 presents the TGTS of the sentence in
question.
Sentence members labelled with AuxK, or
AuxX are collapsed.
The tree reported in figure 4 features arrows of
different colour. The red arrows that link both
the relative pronoun qui and the reflexive
pronoun sibi (assigned t-lemma #PersPron) with
the noun artifex stand for so-called ‘grammatical
coreferences’, i.e. coreferences in which it is
possible to pinpoint the coreferred expression on
the basis of grammatical rules. Instead, the blue
arrow represents a ‘textual coreference’, i.e. a
coreference realized not only by grammatical
means, but also via context (mostly with
pronouns) (Mikulová et al., 2006: 998 and
1,100). In figure 4, a blue arrow links earum
(#PersPron) with the word ars, which occurs in
the previous sentence in the text.
Sibi (#PersPron) is assigned the functor BEN,
because it is the beneficiary of the action carried
out by the Actor (artifex) of the verb vindico.
Sapiens has functor ID (Identity), which labels
explicative genitives. Earum (#PersPron) is the
Patient (PAT) of the noun artifex, because agent
nouns are valency-capable nouns; for this reason,
a newly added node with functor PAT is made
dependent on the agent noun architector. This is
assigned functor EFF (Effect), which is used for
arguments referring to the result of the event,
among which are obligatory predicative
complements (i.e. the role played by architector
with respect to voco). Voco is a RSTR, which is
the functor assigned to the main predicates of
attributive relative clauses. Et is a rhematizer,
which has the noun artifex in its scope.
According to Mikulová et al. (2006: 1,170), in a
TGTS the node representing the rhematizer is
placed as the closest left sister of the first node of
the expression that is in its scope. This is why the
node of et in the TGTS reported in figure 4
depends on vindico instead of artifex, while in
the ATS of figure 3 it depends on the node of
artifices. Despite its left position in the TGTS,
the node of et is marked as focus in TFA and
thus the colour of its node is yellow.

This sentence features two main predicates

sum, the latter being a complex verb, formed by
the perfect participle natus and by the auxiliary
verb sum, which is assigned the analytical
function AuxV (collapsed in the corresponding
TGTS). The fact that the two predicates are
coordinated is signalled by the suffix _Co
appendend to their analytical function (Pred).
Those nodes that depend on the coordinating
conjunction et and are not labelled with an
analytical function suffixed with _Co are meant
to depend on every member of the coordination.
Thus, ego is the subject of both natus sum and
veni, as well as the subordinate clause headed by
perhibeam (via the subordinative conjunction ut)

‘coap’ (coordinations and appositions) and

Veritas is the Addressee (ADDR) of the verb
perhibeo5. Mundus is assigned functor DIR3 and
subfunctor ‘basic’, the latter specifying that here
the meaning of DIR3 is the basic one, i.e. “where

the Aim (AIM) of the verb nascor and of the
verb venio, as well as the subordinate clause

the coordinated predicates.
The TGTS in figure 6 presents two textual
coreferences, linking both the occurrences of hic

“[...] ut testimonium perhibeam veritati” is
coreferent with the two occurrences of hic and
makes their meaning explicit in a cataphoric

started. So far, only the first 200 sentences of
Summa contra Gentiles of Thomas Aquinas have
been fully annotated at tectogrammatical level
(corresponding to 3,112 words and 451
punctuation marks). Such a limited experience
on data does not make it possible to provide an
evaluation neither of the ATS-to-TGTS
conversion scripts nor of the inter-annotator
agreement. Presently, the valency lexicon
contains 221 verbs; the task of building the
lexical entries for nouns, adjectives and adverbs
is going to start in the very near future.
Analytical annotation is available not only for
Medieval Latin texts, but also for Classical Latin,
as the guidelines for the analytical layer of
annotation of the IT-TB are shared with the Latin
Dependency Treebank (LDT;
http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/), a
dependency-based treebank including around
55,000 words from texts of different authors of
the Classical era (Bamman et al., 2007). By
exploiting the common annotation style of the
IT-TB and the LDT, our project will also
perform tectogrammatical annotation of the
Classical Latin texts available in the LDT and
will build the corresponding valency lexicon.
While enhancing a corpus with a new layer of
annotation from scratch still remains a labor-
intensive and time-consuming task, today this is
simplified by the possibility of exploiting the
results provided by previous similar experiences
in language resources development. Such results
can be used for porting background theories,
methods and tools from one language to another
in a rapid and low-cost fashion. This is the
approach pursued by our project, which wants to
apply to Latin a treebank scenario originally
created for Czech and now used also for other
languages (including Arabic and English). Such
an application meets and raises a number of
issues specifically related to corpora of ancient
languages, which make tectogrammatical
annotation of such data a particularly difficult
task. For instance, while treebanks of modern
languages mostly include texts taken from
newspapers, this does not hold true for both the
IT-TB and the LDT, which contain respectively
philosophical (IT-TB) and literary texts (LDT).
These textual genres present several specific
linguistic features in terms of syntax (quite
complex in poetry), semantics (some words
undergo a kind of technical shift of meaning in
philosophical texts) and lexicon (high register
words are pretty frequent). Further, the absence
of native speakers often makes different
interpretations of texts possible and increases the
difficulty of tasks like TFA.
As mentioned above, a large-scale application
of a linguistic theory to real data helps to
empirically test how much sound the theory is. In
our case, the evaluation of the degree of
applicability of FGD to Latin is at its very
beginning. However, analytical annotation has
shown a strong compatibility between the ATS-
based description of surface syntax and its
application to Latin. As a matter of fact, the PDT
manual for analytical annotation was adapted in
just a few details for the treatment of specific
constructions of Latin (such as the ablative
absolute or the passive periphrastic) that could be
syntactically annotated in several different ways
(Bamman et al., 2008). This experience
represents a positive background for a project
that wants to build a set of theoretically-
motivated advanced language resources for Latin
that will provide users with information about
morphology, surface syntax and semantics at
both textual and lexical level.
Such advanced language resources for Latin
will both improve the understanding of Latin
language and question the usual research
methods pursued by scholars in Classics.
As for the former, research in Latin linguistics
dealing with issues like semantic role labelling,
valency, ellipsis resolution, coreferential analysis
and information structure will finally be able to
ground on a relevant amount of empirical
evidence not created for the aims of one specific
research, thus preventing the vicious circle of
building a corpus just for studying a single
linguistic phenomenon (Sinclair, 2004b). Also,
making available language resources that both

feature Latin texts of differents eras and share the
same annotation style with language resources of
modern languages will impact diachronic
research and support studies in comparative
linguistics.
As for the latter, building advanced language
resources for Latin by connecting a large-scale
empirical analysis of Latin data with a modern
and broadly evaluated linguistic theory
represents a challenging and unconventional
approach, which is expected to strongly impact
the usual research methods in the field of
Classics. Indeed, due to an age-old split holding
between linguistic and literary studies, the study
of Latin (and of Ancient Greek, as well) has been
primarily pursued by focusing on literary,
philological and glottological aspects. Further, a
large number of classicists is, still today,
unwilling both to apply computational methods
to textual analysis and to use language resources
like annotated corpora and computational lexica.
Computational linguists, in turn, are more prone
to develop language resources and NLP tools for
living languages, which have stronger
commercial, media and social impact.
Considering collaboration between Classics and
computational linguistics to be essential, this
project provides an opportunity for innovation of
both fields.
Both the treebanks and the valency lexicon
will be publicly available datasets with explicit
annotation guidelines. This will make the results
achieved by using these language resources
replicable, which is a not yet consolidated
practice in Classics.

Presently, the valency lexicon contains 221 verbs; the task of building the lexical entries for nouns, adjectives and adverbs is going to start in the very near future. Analytical annotation is available not only for Medieval Latin texts, but also for Classical Latin, as the guidelines for the analytical layer of annotation of the IT-TB are shared with the Latin Dependency Treebank (LDT; http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/), a dependency-based treebank including around 55,000 words from texts of different authors of the Classical era (Bamman et al., 2007). By exploiting the common annotation style of the IT-TB and the LDT, our project will also perform tectogrammatical annotation of the Classical Latin texts available in the LDT and will build the corresponding valency lexicon. While enhancing a corpus with a new layer of annotation from scratch still remains a laborintensive and time-consuming task, today this is simplified by the possibility of exploiting the results provided by previous similar experiences in language resources development.

As a matter of fact, the PDT manual for analytical annotation was adapted in just a few details for the treatment of specific constructions of Latin (such as the ablative absolute or the passive periphrastic) that could be syntactically annotated in several different ways (Bamman et al., 2008).

The semantic layer of annotation of the treebank is detailed and the theoretical framework supporting the annotation style is explained and motivated. 1 Introduction Started in 1949 by father Roberto Busa SJ, the Index Thomisticus (IT; Busa, 1974-1980) has represented a groundbreaking project that laid the foundations of computational linguistics and literary computing. The IT is a morphologically tagged and lemmatized corpus of Medieval Latin containing the opera omnia of Thomas Aquinas (118 texts), as well as 61 texts by other authors related to Thomas, for a total of around 11 million tokens. The Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB: http://itreebank.marginalia.it) is the syntactically annotated portion of the IT. Presently, the IT-TB includes around 220,000 nodes (approximately, 12,000 sentences). The project of the IT-TB is now ente</context>

In this respect, the annotation style of the IT-TB is based on Functional Generative Description (FGD; Sgall et al., 1986), a dependency-based theoretical framework developed in Prague and intensively applied and tested while building the Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech (PDT). FGD is rooted in Praguian structuralismfunctionalism dating back to the 30s, one assumption of which is the stratificational approach to sentence analysis pursued by Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), a linguistic theory developed by Jan Firbas in the mid-1950s on the basis of Vilém Mathesius’ work (Firbas, 1992). According to FSP, the sentence is conceived as: (a) a singular and individual speech event [utterance-event]; (b) one of the possible different minimal communicative units (means) of the given language [form]; (c) an abstract structure (a pattern) [meaning]. Considering language as a form-meaning composite is a basic assumption also of FGD, which is particularly focused on the last point above, aiming at the description of the so-called ‘underlying syntax’ of the sentence. Underlying syntax (the meaning) is separated from (but still connected with) surface syntax (the form) and represents th</context>

The ‘dialogue test’ by Panevová (1974-1975) is used as the guiding criterion for obligatoriness. TGTSs feature two dimensions that represent respectively the syntactic structure of the sentence (the vertical dimension) and its information structure (‘topicfocus articulation’, TFA), based on the underlying word order (the horizontal dimension). In FGD, TFA deals with the opposition between contextual boundness (the ‘given’ information, on the left) and contextual unboundness (the ‘new’ information, on the right). Also ellipsis resolution and coreferential analysis are performed at the tectogrammatical layer and are represented in </context>

Thus, the annotation workflow is based on TGTSs automatically converted from ATSs. The TGTSs that result from conversion are then checked and refined manually by two independent annotators. Conversion is performed by adapting to Latin a number of ATS-to-TGTS scripts provided by the NLP framework Treex developed in Prague (Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010). Relying on ATSs, the basic functions of these scripts are: (a) to collapse ATSs nodes of function words and punctuation marks, as they no longer receive a node for themselves in TGTSs, but are included into the autosemantic nodes; (b) to assign basic functors (such as Actor and Patient); (c) to assign ‘grammatemes’, i.e. semantic counterparts of morphological categories (for instance, pluralia tantum are tagged with the number grammateme ‘singular’). The annotation guidelines are those for the tectogrammatical layer of the PDT (Mikulová et al., 2006). In the following, three examples of tect</context>

Underlying syntax (the meaning) is separated from (but still connected with) surface syntax (the form) and represents the linguistic (literal) meaning of the sentence, which is described through dependency tree-graphs. This approach is consistent with the functional and pragmatic analysis of language pursued by the Prague Linguistic Circle since its very beginning, along the so-called ‘first period’ of the Circle (Raynaud, 2008). Language is conceived as “un système de moyens d’expression appropriés à un but” (“a system of purposive means”; Cercle linguistique de Prague, 1929: 7). The “moyens d’expression” correspond to the ‘form’ (surface syntax), while the fact that they are “appropriés à un but” corresponds to the ‘meaning’ (underlying syntax). The description of surface and underlying syntax in FGD is dependency-based mostly because dependency grammars are predicatefocused grammars. This enables FGD to face one of the basic statements of the Prague Linguistic Circle: “l’acte syntagmatique fondamental [...] est la</context>

The choice of a representation framework alone does not determine the representation for a given sentence, as there can be many (correct) dependency-based (as well as constituencybased) trees for even simple sentences. Thus, a fine-grained linguistic theory must be selected to support the specific aspects raised by a largescale annotation of real data. In this respect, the annotation style of the IT-TB is based on Functional Generative Description (FGD; Sgall et al., 1986), a dependency-based theoretical framework developed in Prague and intensively applied and tested while building the Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech (PDT). FGD is rooted in Praguian structuralismfunctionalism dating back to the 30s, one assumption of which is the stratificational approach to sentence analysis pursued by Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), a linguistic theory developed by Jan Firbas in the mid-1950s on the basis of Vilém Mathesius’ work (Firbas, 1992). According to FSP, the sentence is conceived as: (a) a singular and individual speech event [utterance-event]; (b) one of</context>

Such advanced language resources for Latin will both improve the understanding of Latin language and question the usual research methods pursued by scholars in Classics. As for the former, research in Latin linguistics dealing with issues like semantic role labelling, valency, ellipsis resolution, coreferential analysis and information structure will finally be able to ground on a relevant amount of empirical evidence not created for the aims of one specific research, thus preventing the vicious circle of building a corpus just for studying a single linguistic phenomenon (Sinclair, 2004b). Also, making available language resources that both 107 feature Latin texts of differents eras and share the same annotation style with language resources of modern languages will impact diachronic research and support studies in comparative linguistics. As for the latter, building advanced language resources for Latin by connecting a large-scale empirical analysis of Latin data with a modern and broadly evaluated linguistic theory represents a challenging and unconventional approach, which is expected to strongly impact the usual research methods in the field of Classics.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.997130822222222">
Mental health problems are among the costliest challenges we face, in every possible sense of cost. The
numbers are staggering: to cite just a few, in the United States mental health spending accounted for
$33 billion in 1986, $100 billion in 2003, and is projected to increase to $203 billion for 2014; some
25 million American adults will have an episode of major depression this year; and suicide is the third
leading cause of death for people between 10 and 24 years old. The importance of clinical psychology
as a problem space cannot be overstated.
For clinical psychologists, language plays a central role in diagnosis. Indeed, many clinical instruments
fundamentally rely on what is, in effect, manual annotation of patient language. Applying language
technology in this domain, e.g. in language-based assessment, could potentially have an enormous
impact, because many individuals are motivated to underreport psychiatric symptoms (consider active
duty soldiers, for example) or lack the self-awareness to report accurately (consider individuals involved
in substance abuse who do not recognize their own addiction), and because many people — e.g. those
without adequate insurance or in rural areas — cannot even obtain access to a clinician who is qualified
to perform a psychological evaluation. Bringing language technology to bear on these problems could
potentially lead to inexpensive screening measures that could be administered by a wider array of
healthcare professionals, which is particularly important since the majority of individuals who present
with symptoms of mental health problems do so in a primary care physician’s office. Given the burden on
primary care physicians to diagnose mental health disorders in very little time, the American Academy
of Family Physicians has recognized the need for diagnostic tools for physicians that are “suited to the
realities of their practice&amp;quot;.
Although automated language analysis connected with mental health conditions goes back at least as far
as the 1990s, it has not been a major focus for computational linguistics compared with other application
domains. However, recently there has been noticable uptick in research activity on this topic. One recent
shared task brings together research on the Big-5 personality traits, and another involved research on
identification of emotion in suicide notes. Research has been done on language analysis in the context
of, for example, autistic spectrum disorders, dementia, depression, post-partum depression, general life
satisfaction , and suicide risk. This increase in attention is consistent with, and gains power from,
the recent rise in computational linguistics activity connected with computational social science more
broadly.
With computational linguistics research on this topic moving toward critical mass, one key goal of this
workshop was to bring together researchers to discuss the current state of the art, share methods, and
set directions for the future. The workshop had a second goal also, though: to directly engage clinical
practitioners in mental health. By including clinicians on our program committee and as discussants, the
workshop was designed to increase NLP practitioners’ understanding of what mental health clinicians
do and what their real needs are, and to increase clinical practitioners’ understanding of what is possible
in NLP and what it might have to offer.
We received a total of 17 submissions. Of these, 7 (41%) were accepted for oral presentation and
discussion, and an additional 7 were selected for inclusion in the workshop’s poster session.
We wish to thank everyone who showed interest and submitted a paper, all of the authors for their
iii
contributions, the members of the Program Committee for their thoughtful reviews, our clinical
practitioner discussants, and all the attendees of the workshop. We also wish to extend sincere thanks
to the Association for Computational Linguistics for making this workshop possible, and to CHIB, the
Center for Health-related Informatics and Bioimaging at the University of Maryland, for its generous
sponsorship.

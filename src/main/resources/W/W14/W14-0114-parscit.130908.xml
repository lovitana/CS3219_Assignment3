Abstract
Sinhala is one of the official languages of Sri
Lanka and is used by over 19 million people.
It belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the In-
do-European languages and its origins date
back to at least 2000 years. It has developed
into its current form over a long period of time
with influences from a wide variety of lan-
guages including Tamil, Portuguese and Eng-
lish. As for any other language, a WordNet is
extremely important for Sinhala to take it into
the digital era. This paper is based on the pro-
ject to develop a WordNet for Sinhala based
on the English (Princeton) WordNet. It de-
scribes how we overcame the challenges in
adding Sinhala specific characteristics which
were deemed important by Sinhala language
experts to the WordNet while keeping the
structure of the original English WordNet. It
also presents the details of the crowdsourcing
system we developed as a part of the project -
consisting of a NoSQL database in the
backend and a web-based frontend. We con-
clude by discussing the possibility of adapting
this architecture for other languages and the
road ahead for the Sinhala WordNet and Sin-
hala NLP.
Despite being used by over 19 million people
and being one of the official languages of Sri
Lanka, there has not been much progress in de-
veloping natural language processing (NLP) ap-
plications for the Sinhala language. This is partly
due to the lack of commercial interest on devel-
oping Sinhala NLP applications on a global
scale. For instance, as of now, neither Google
Translate1 nor Google News 2 is available for
Sinhala while both are available in Hindi and
Tamil – two other regional languages spoken by
a much larger population and thus with a higher
business value.
Within this backdrop, we believe that develop-
ing a fully functional WordNet for Sinhala would
provide a much needed boost for the Sinahla
NLP work. This is because it is well recognized
that a WordNet is a very important tool in per-
forming natural language processing tasks for
any language. A WordNet will be helpful to Sin-
hala NLP application developers in tasks ranging
from word sense disambiguation and information
retrieval to translation. Moreover a Sinhala
WordNet will be a valuable resource to linguists

studying the Sinhala language. We paid special
attention to the interests and concerns of the lat-
ter group as described later in the paper.
The project team, mainly consisting of per-
sonnel from the Knowledge and Language Engi-
neering Lab of University of Moratuwa, started
the task of developing a WordNet for Sinhala
with several brainstorming sessions which in-
volved Sinhala language experts, computer sci-
ence specialists and people who had previously
made some contributions in digitizing the Sinha-
la language (for example in developing Sinhala
Unicode characters). Although we were biased
towards using the expansion approach, which
develops a WordNet based on an existing
WordNet for another language, we discussed the
possibility of adopting the merge approach,
which develops a WordNet using the first princi-
ples by leveraging existing dictionaries and other
resources (Bhattacharyya, 2010). We settled on
the expansion approach because it was evident
that we do not have the resources to successfully
pursue the merge approach.
We came up with basic design for the Word-
Net through the above mentioned brainstorming
sessions and then proceeded to develop the tech-
nical infrastructure needed. This consists of de-
veloping Sinhala WordNet APIs and a web inter-
face as well as a crowdsourcing system to add
synsets and relationships. The latter is needed
because coming up with Sinhala synsets and re-
lationships based on the synsets of another lan-
guage requires a lot of manual work. Initially we
were planning to use the Hindi WordNet as the
source WordNet but switched to the English
WordNet a couple of months into the project.
The reasons for this change are discussed in Sec-
tion 2.2. Apart from this the development effort
proceeded fairly smoothly and we have complet-
ed the implementation of the WordNet API and
the crowdsourcing system. Currently we are in
the process of adding synsets using this system.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we present the details of the discus-
sions we had with Sinhala language experts and
the effects these discussions had in the structure
of the Sinhala WordNet. In Section 3 we discuss
the technical details of the project. Here, we de-
scribe the use of a NoSQL database to facilitate
modification to a WordNet, which has not been
done before to the best of our knowledge. In Sec-
tion 4, we describe how the crowdsourcing sys-
tem works including how it gives suggestions to
the contributors simplifying their task. We reflect
on some important aspects of the project includ-
ing the possibility of adopting the entire system
to other languages in Section 5. We present the
details of some related work in Section 6 and
provide concluding remarks in Section 7.
2 Developing the Linguistic Infrastruc-
ture
Development of linguistic infrastructure was car-
ried out as the first phase of the project. Several
discussions with Sinhala language experts were
conducted to better understand the key features
of the Sinhala language.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99942">
2.1 Discussions with Sinhala Linguists
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944533053097345">
From the beginning of the project the develop-
ment team was collaborating with some promi-
nent experts on Sinhala language. The basic idea
of this collaboration was to acquire the necessary
knowledge of the Sinhala language to get to
know the linguistic requirements of a Sinhala
WordNet and to form an expert evaluator panel
to help with the crowdsourcing effort in develop-
ing the WordNet.
One important topic discussed with the experts
was that Sinhala has a significant difference in
written and spoken usage. These differences in-
clude differences in word usage and differences
in grammar. We were particularly interested in
differences in word usage in spoken and written
forms as grammar rules fall outside the scope of
a WordNet. It was observed that words with sub-
tle but important differences are used in the writ-
ten and spoken forms of Sinhala. For instance,
for the sense “man”, මිනිසා (minisa) is the most
frequent word used in written Sinhalese while
මිනිහා (miniha) is the most frequent word used in
spoken Sinhalese. While the difference is subtle
(a single phoneme in this case) its implications
are significant for a natural speaker of Sinhala. In
this case, using මිනිසා in normal conversations
appears extremely odd. Moreover such differ-
ences are very common and combining words
used in spoken and written Sinhala results in
very odd phrases.
The problem faced by us was whether to in-
clude this difference in the Sinhala WordNet.
Doing so would go against the main objective of
a WordNet which is organizing words by their
meanings; clearly there is no difference in the
meanings of මිනිසා and මිනිහා as it is simply a
matter of language usage. Despite this concern,
we decided to include this difference as a flag for
each word due to the following reasons.
1. Not including these in the WordNet would
result in the loss of a valuable opportunity
to encode these differences in a machine
readable manner; the contributors of the
crowdsourcing system can do this with lit-
tle extra effort but doing it as a separate
project would require a lot more effort.
The importance of this factor is magnified
by the lack of commercial interest in Sin-
hala NLP.
2. Since one of the primary reasons for de-
veloping a Sinhala WordNet was to serve
the needs of Sinhala linguists we wanted
to accommodate their requirements. We
suspected that eliminating this type of in-
formation would make the WordNet less
useful to them. Janssen (2002) has made a
similar argument with regards to eliminat-
ing gender information from WordNets.
Hence, adding this information to the
WordNet was seen as a pragmatic move.
3. Different words being used in spoken and
written Sinhala is an extremely common
phenomenon that cannot simply be ig-
nored or left for later consideration.
By the same reasoning, we decided to add few
more features of the Sinhala language to the
WordNet. One of them is the gender difference.
The genders in Sinhala are masculine and femi-
nine but none are specified for some words (typi-
cally for things that are not alive). The gender of
a noun is important as it decides which morpho-
logical form of a verb is used with it. Thus the
Sinhala WordNet will contain the gender of each
noun, if exists.
The Sinhala words can be divided into three
main categories called native words, words di-
rectly borrowed from another language which are
being used without any change (තත්සම - tatsama)
and the words borrowed from another language
and have been modified (තත්භව - tatbawa). The
words have been mainly borrowed from Sanskrit,
Pali, Hindi, Portuguese, English, Tamil and
Dutch. In constructing phrases in Sinhala, the
origin of the word should be considered similar
to how the spoken/written differentiation is used.
As an example ‘mathru’(මාතෘ) and ‘maw’(මව්)
are two forms to express the meaning “mother’s”
in Sinhala but ‘mathru’ is a tatsama while ‘maw’
is a tatbawa. ‘snehaya’(ස්නේහය) and
‘senehasa’(නසනෙහස) means ‘affection’ which
again are tatsama and tatbawa. To express
“mother’s affection”, people use either ‘mathru
snehaya’(මාතෘ ස්නේහය) or ‘maw senehasa’(මව්
නසනෙහස) while the other two combinations ap-
pear odd. This is despite the fact that all four
words are acceptable in written Sinhala. Thus
details of the origin of a word are also included
in the Sinhala WordNet. Both the source lan-
guage and the derivation type (tatsama/tatbawa)
are kept on this regard.
Each noun in Sinhala can be in 9 morphologi-
cal forms called ‘vibhakthi’(විභක්ති). Furthermore
there are fairly complicated rules in forming
compound words called ‘sandi’(සේධි) and ‘sa-
masa’(සමාස). The formation of these forms and
rules as well as the inflectional forms of a verb
are based on the root of the word, which may not
be the most commonly used form of the word.
Therefore, it was decided to keep the word root
as well as the most common morphological form
in storing a word in the WordNet.
In summary, we decided to include the follow-
ing features for each word.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9997854">
• Written/ Spoken usage
• Gender
• Origin of the word
• Word root
• The most common morphological form
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966">
It is interesting to relate these features, which
are deemed important in representing Sinhala
words in a machine-processable format, to a
standard lexical-encoding framework. Our dis-
cussion on this regards is based on the lemon
(Lexicon Model for Ontologies) framework
(McCrae et al., 2012). Our view is that the writ-
ten/spoken usage and the origin of the word are
properties under the linguistic description mod-
ule of lemon outside its core. These will be used
by the phrase-structure module in identifying
well-formed phrases. The word root is related to
the morphology module and is used in inflection
while the most common morphological form is
the main lexical entry in the core for the word in
concern. The gender information is useful for
inflection in the morphology module and in rec-
ognizing words that do not have certain morpho-
logical forms. (e.g., රැජිණ - rajina - the queen
does not have a masculine form).

2.2 Selecting the Source WordIet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997148125">
As mentioned earlier we decided to develop the
Sinhala WordNet following the expansion ap-
proach due to practical considerations. Then the
question was which WordNet to use as the
source WordNet. We first decided to use the
Hindi WordNet (Jha et al., 2001) for this purpose
due to the following reasons.
1. The Sinhala language belongs to the Indo-
Aryan branch of the Indo-European lan-
guages and is heavily influenced by the clas-
sical Indian languages of Sanskrit and Pali.
Since Hindi is close to Sanskrit and the Hin-
di WordNet is fairly sophisticated - it serves
as the hub of the Indo WordNet initiative
(Bhattacharyya, 2010) - we assumed that the
Hindi WordNet would provide a good basis
for developing the Sinhala WordNet. We
even considered using the Sankrit WordNet
as the source WordNet but realized that it is
still in an early stage.
2. The success of the Indo WordNet initiative
in creating WordNets for many languages in
India (Bhattacharyya, 2010) was one of the
main motivations for us in embarking on this
project. It was assumed that using the Hindi
WordNet as the source WordNet would help
us leverage the success of the Indo WordNet.
However, as we proceeded with the devel-
opment work, it was apparent that using the Hin-
di WordNet as the source WordNet was not a
viable option. The following are the main rea-
sons for this.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.922503423076923">
1. Despite the perceived similarity in the ori-
gins of the languages, Hindi and Sinhala are
very different languages in many aspects re-
lated to WordNet construction: One difficul-
ty associated with this is that Hindi is written
in Devanagari script, which is not familiar to
most Sinhala speakers. (Sinhala has its own
alphabet). Moreover, for many Hindi words
it was difficult to identify Sinhala words with
the same meaning, even after knowing how
the word is pronounced. It was thought that
translating Hindi words to Sinhala would be
easier once the pronunciation is known be-
cause words of the languages are often pro-
nounced similarly – e.g., Sinhala බresා
(baaya) vs. Hindi भाई (bhai) meaning broth-
er. It was seen that such similarities are not
very common. As a result, we found our-
selves frequently translating words from
Hindi to English to understand the relevant
Sinhala words.
2. It was seen that adopting the technical infra-
structure of the Indo WordNet project to de-
velop the Sinhala WordNet was difficult.
Part of this is due the communication diffi-
culties – all other WordNets of the Indo
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.904188090909091">
WordNet have been developed within India
itself. In addition, our requirement to add
flags to words in addition to flags for synsets
as described in Section 2.1 created additional
complexities and we found that accommo-
dating these changes in the Indo WordNet
text database stricture was very difficult. The
Princeton English WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998), with its extensive documentation and
the support network was seen as a much bet-
ter alternative in this context.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9988897">
3. A significant percentage of native Sinhala
speakers have a working knowledge in Eng-
lish and it was seen that this will be very use-
ful for a crowdsourcing system. In contrast,
familiarity with the Hindi language is not
widespread and this combined with the fact
that most Hindi words are apparently unfa-
miliar to Sinhala speakers as described in
(1), means that it is very difficult to use the
Hindi WordNet in a crowdsourcing system.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99949855">
Based mainly on the above factors, we
switched the source WordNet from Hindi to Eng-
lish early in the development stage. The fact that
the WordNets for Arabic (Rodriguez et al., 2008)
and Japanese (Isahara et al., 2008), which have
very little in common with English, have also
been developed with the English WordNet as the
source, also weighed in on our decision.
We were mindful of the consequences of us-
ing the English WordNet as the source WordNet
in developing the Sinhala WordNet. It has been
stated that the source WordNet can have a dis-
tracting influence on the new WordNet being
created especially when the two languages exist
in different regions and cultural settings
(Bhattacharyya, 2010). It is clear that this con-
cern is applicable here. As such we decided to
aggressively remove existing synsets in the Eng-
lish WordNet and add new synsets as necessary
when developing the Sinhala WordNet.

3 Developing the Technical Infrastruc-
ture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998259">
After developing the linguistic infrastructure, we
focused on developing the technical infrastruc-
ture according to the requirements identified.
The main challenges we faced here were resolv-
ing the complications arising when extending the
Princeton WordNet API, dealing with different
data structures, and selecting tools and technolo-
gies. In this section, we describe the salient fea-
tures of the architecture of the system and how
we approached the above mentioned challenges.

3.1 The WordNet API
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872916666667">
The Sinhala WordNet API is implemented on the
Java platform extending the English WordNet
API (JWNL)3. The basic idea of developing this
API is to provide general WordNet functionali-
ties as well as the specific functionalities of the
Sinhala WordNet discussed above. We defined
new classes for synset, word, noun, verb, adjec-
tive and adverb extending the JWNL classes. The
JWNL documentation and mailing lists were ex-
tremely helpful to us in this exercise. Incorporat-
ing Sinhala characters in the API was based on
the Sinhala Unicode characters.

Figure 1 shows the architecture of the entire sys-
tem, consisting of the API and the crowdsourcing
system. For the non-technical users, the main
outputs of the system are the online and offline
Sinhala WordNet browsers and the web-based

opers will have access to these components as
well as the source code of the Sinhala WordNet
API, WordNet Constructor Core - which governs
how the crowdsourcing system operates -, the
MongoDBToTextDB Transformer and the sche-
mata of the underlying databases.

<listItem confidence="0.950401909090909">
1. The English WordNet: The data contained in
the English WordNet text database in terms
of synsets and relationships are used.
2. The NoSQL Database: The modifications

are stored in this database.
3. Linguistic Resources: Several linguistic re-
sources such as available machine readable

<bodyText confidence="0.999705">
Components in the Data Access Layer are used
by the two components in the Process Layer to
access the necessary data.
The MongoDBToTextDB transformer gets
the data from the NoSQL database as well as the
text database of the English WordNet because
the NoSQL database only contains the modifica-
tions made by collaborators. It combines the data
from the two sources into the text database of the
Sinhala WordNet API. This step is carried out
when releasing a new version of the Sinhala
WordNet.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995922">
3.3 Use of a NoSQL Database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999572833333333">
According to the system architecture described
above, we need a database to store the modifica-
tions performed by the contributors of the
crowdsourcing system. The modifications in-
clude adding Sinhala words to a synset, adding
features to words and synsets, adding relation-
ships between words/synsets and adding and re-
moving synsets.
Until recently, the standard solution for this
type of a data storage need has been to use a rela-
tional database system. However, the use of
NoSQL databases has increased in the recent
past partly due to the flexibility it offers to the
schema designer. Instead of being restricted to a
relational schema, which often requires multiple
tuples spread across several relations for the
same logical data unit, NoSQL databases allows
the designers to store data according to the se-
mantics behind them. We realized that these ad-
vantages will be important in our system since a
synset consists of an unlimited number of words,
each with several distinct features.
Another advantage of using NoSQL databases
is that they provide better scalability than rela-
tional database systems especially in setting up
multiple servers connected to a web-based front-
end. This too will be helpful in using a crow-
sourcing approach for WordNet creation as the
system will provide better performance for the
contributors.

However, it was noted that NoSQL solutions
do not guarantee consistency of the database alt-
hough they provide eventual consistency. There-
fore, it is possible, in rare conditions, for two
contributors to make contradictory updates in the
database. In the context of our system, these in-
consistencies can be resolved later, generally in
evaluation. Moreover any inconsistencies do not
affect the releases of the Sinhala WordNet as
they use the text database, assuming that any
contradictions are resolved before a release.
We concluded that the advantages of NoSQL
databases outweigh their disadvantages and de-
cided to use one. We selected the MongoDB
NoSQL (Plugge et al, 2010) system. Table 1
shows the schema we used for nouns. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time a NoSQL
database has been used in developing a Word-
Net.
Currently, the source repository is maintained
as a private GitHub project. We will make it pub-
lic in the near future.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.948496">
4.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998976666666667">
As mentioned earlier, a crowdsourcing system to
facilitate the development of the Sinhala Word-
Net was designed and implemented as a part of
the project. As illustrated in Figure 1, the Word-
Net Constructor Core component contains the
major functionalities of this system. It obtains
different types of data through the components of
the Data Access Layer and provides an interface
to be used by the web-based interface of the
crowdsourcing system. The following are the
different types of data used by this component
through the Data Access Layer.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991959">
1. Information contained in the English
WordNet through the EWN API (JWNL).
2. Information obtained from several linguis-

tic resources for the Sinhala language in-
cluding machine readable dictionaries and
thesauri. These are used to specify sugges-
tions to contributors to simplify their task
as described in Section 4.2.
3. Information contained in the mongoDB
database, which contains the modifica-
tions made by the contributors as men-
tioned earlier.
The web-based user interface allows contributors
to browse through the English WordNet hierar-
chy and perform modifications as necessary. If
no work has been done on a particular synset of
the English WordNet, they will be shown the
data contained in the English WordNet and are
expected to replace them with Sinhala words.
These changes include adding words to synsets,
specifying flags for the words (e.g., whether the
word is used in written/spoken Sinhala) and add-
ing relationships. All the modifications are saved
in the MongoDB database.

Figure 2 shows the web interface when adding
Sinhala words/relationships for the English syn-
set for one sense of the word “phenomenon”.
Since Sinhala words have not been added to this
synset, it shows the available information in the
English WordNet. In addition, it shows suggest-
ed Sinhala words obtained from linguistic re-
sources as described in Section 4.2.
The web-based user interface is operational
and can be accessed from
http://www.wordnet.lk. The modifica-
tions made by the contributors have to be ap-
proved by an evaluator before being included in
a release.
How to effectively use a crowdsourcing tech-
nique to get a particular task done with accepta-
ble quality is an open research question. Dow et
al. (2012) have found that assessment of work
produced, whether it is external assessment or
self-assessment, if very helpful on this regard. As
such, we expect the feedback provided by evalu-
ators to help our effort.

4.2 Providing Suggestions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913142857143">
The purpose of providing suggestions for con-
tributors is simplifying their task so that they do
not have to rely entirely on their knowledge and
available printed material. Currently, we provide
suggestions for English words based on machine
readable English to Sinhala and Sinhala to Sinha-
la dictionaries and thesauri. Out of the available
resources, we found the Madura English-Sinhala
dictionary (Kulatunga, undefined) particularly

5.1 The Morphology of the Language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973">
Sinhala is an inflectional language where many
verbs and nouns have a fairly large number of
morphological forms. Verbs and nouns frequent-
ly have more than 10 morphological forms when
considering both spoken and written forms. This
has implications for the WordNet as a person or
a software system searching for a word may use
a different morphological form from what is con-
tained in the WordNet. We decided against stor-
ing all morphological forms of a word in the
WordNet since that increases the number of
words for a synset to an unmanageable level. As
such a good morphological analyzer, which is
external to the WordNet is necessary to obtain
the full benefits of the WordNet. There have
been previous attempts to develop a morphologi-
cal analyzer for Sinhala which have produced
satisfactory results (Hettiage, 2006; Fernando
and Weerasinghe 2013).

5.2 Extending to Other Languages

<bodyText confidence="0.999996428571429">
While we did not develop our system with the
objective of developing WordNets for languages
other than Sinhala, we recognize that it has the
potential to be used in this manner. The architec-
ture of the system has to be changed in some
places, for example in using linguistic resources
of other languages for providing suggestions for
contributors. But the overall design of displaying
the information of the English WordNet, allow-
ing the contributors to modify them with words
from the target language and storing the modifi-
cations in the NoSQL database can be easily ap-
plied in developing a WordNet for another lan-
guage based on the English WordNet following
the expansion approach. It is possible to reuse
the schema of the MongoDB database and the
source code of the crowdsourcing interface, the
WordNet Constructor Core and the MongoD-
BToTextDB Transformer in such an exercise.
We plan to separate out these parts from our
codebase as a future work.

5.3 Current Status
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980416666667">
The crowdsourcing system is currently opera-
tional and the number of synsets in the Sinhala
WordNet is approaching 2000. This number is
significant since this has been used as a marker
by the Indo WordNet project in developing
WordNets for languages in India (Bhattacharyya,
2010). Our goal is to release the first complete
version early next year.
The Knowledge and Language Engineering
Lab of the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at University of Moratuwa is coor-
dinating this effort.

<bodyText confidence="0.999846">
The Hindi WordNet and the Indo WordNet initi-
ative provided a lot of inspiration to us in at-
tempting to develop a WordNet for Sinhala fol-
lowing the expansion approach. We followed
their work in several aspects of the project such
as the use of crowdsourcing to generate synsets.
There has been a previous work on develop-
ing a WordNet for Sinhla by Welgama et al.
(2011), which is basically an exploration on de-
veloping a WordNet for Sinhala by extracting
some common words from a corpus and getting
the help of Sinhala language experts to come up
with synsets based on them. It can be seen that
this work is related to the merge approach. Our
work differs from this effort in our use of the
expansion approach and the objective of devel-
oping a complete WordNet.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956125">
Developing a fully functional Sinhala WordNet
can be considered a landmark in NLP for Sinhala
and we believe that we are well set to achieve
this in the near future. This will provide a tre-
mendous boost for developing Sinhala NLP ap-
plications such as information retrieval systems,
text classifiers and summarizers and translators.
The availability of a platform in terms of a
WordNet may even attract some commercial in-
terest for Sinhala NLP.
It should also be recognized that our work has
the potential to be generalized into a system that
can be used to bootstrap WordNet creation for a
language. If this goal can be achieved, it will be
extremely helpful in developing WordNets for
minority languages such as Sinhala.

Although we were biased towards using the expansion approach, which develops a WordNet based on an existing WordNet for another language, we discussed the possibility of adopting the merge approach, which develops a WordNet using the first principles by leveraging existing dictionaries and other resources (Bhattacharyya, 2010). We settled on the expansion approach because it was evident that we do not have the resources to successfully pursue the merge approach. We came up with basic design for the WordNet through the above mentioned brainstorming sessions and then proceeded to develop the technical infrastructure needed. This consists of developing Sinhala WordNet APIs and a web interface as well as a crowdsourcing system to add synsets and relationships. The latter is needed because coming up with Sinhala synsets and relationships based on the synsets of another language requires a lot of manual work. Initially w</context>

Then the question was which WordNet to use as the source WordNet. We first decided to use the Hindi WordNet (Jha et al., 2001) for this purpose due to the following reasons. 1. The Sinhala language belongs to the IndoAryan branch of the Indo-European languages and is heavily influenced by the classical Indian languages of Sanskrit and Pali. Since Hindi is close to Sanskrit and the Hindi WordNet is fairly sophisticated - it serves as the hub of the Indo WordNet initiative (Bhattacharyya, 2010) - we assumed that the Hindi WordNet would provide a good basis for developing the Sinhala WordNet. We even considered using the Sankrit WordNet as the source WordNet but realized that it is still in an early stage. 2. The success of the Indo WordNet initiative in creating WordNets for many languages in India (Bhattacharyya, 2010) was one of the main motivations for us in embarking on this project. It was assumed that using the Hindi WordNet as the source WordNet would help us leverage the success of the Indo WordNet. However, as we proceeded with the development work, it was apparent that usi</context>
<context position="16083" citStr="Bhattacharyya, 2010" startWordPosition="2657" endWordPosition="2658">English early in the development stage. The fact that the WordNets for Arabic (Rodriguez et al., 2008) and Japanese (Isahara et al., 2008), which have very little in common with English, have also been developed with the English WordNet as the source, also weighed in on our decision. We were mindful of the consequences of using the English WordNet as the source WordNet in developing the Sinhala WordNet. It has been stated that the source WordNet can have a distracting influence on the new WordNet being created especially when the two languages exist in different regions and cultural settings (Bhattacharyya, 2010). It is clear that this concern is applicable here. As such we decided to aggressively remove existing synsets in the English WordNet and add new synsets as necessary when developing the Sinhala WordNet. 3 Developing the Technical Infrastructure After developing the linguistic infrastructure, we focused on developing the technical infrastructure according to the requirements identified. The main challenges we faced here were resolving the complications arising when extending the Princeton WordNet API, dealing with different data structures, and selecting tools and technologies.

Since Sinhala words have not been added to this synset, it shows the available information in the English WordNet. In addition, it shows suggested Sinhala words obtained from linguistic resources as described in Section 4.2. The web-based user interface is operational and can be accessed from http://www.wordnet.lk. The modifications made by the contributors have to be approved by an evaluator before being included in a release. How to effectively use a crowdsourcing technique to get a particular task done with acceptable quality is an open research question. Dow et al. (2012) have found that assessment of work produced, whether it is external assessment or self-assessment, if very helpful on this regard. As such, we expect the feedback provided by evaluators to help our effort. 4.2 Providing Suggestions The purpose of providing suggestions for contributors is simplifying their task so that they do not have to rely entirely on their knowledge and available printed material.

The importance of this factor is magnified by the lack of commercial interest in Sinhala NLP. 2. Since one of the primary reasons for developing a Sinhala WordNet was to serve the needs of Sinhala linguists we wanted to accommodate their requirements. We suspected that eliminating this type of information would make the WordNet less useful to them. Janssen (2002) has made a similar argument with regards to eliminating gender information from WordNets. Hence, adding this information to the WordNet was seen as a pragmatic move. 3. Different words being used in spoken and written Sinhala is an extremely common phenomenon that cannot simply be ignored or left for later consideration. By the same reasoning, we decided to add few more features of the Sinhala language to the WordNet. One of them is the gender difference. The genders in Sinhala are masculine and feminine but none are specified for some words (typically for things that are not alive). The gend</context>

Therefore, it was decided to keep the word root as well as the most common morphological form in storing a word in the WordNet. In summary, we decided to include the following features for each word. • Written/ Spoken usage • Gender • Origin of the word • Word root • The most common morphological form It is interesting to relate these features, which are deemed important in representing Sinhala words in a machine-processable format, to a standard lexical-encoding framework. Our discussion on this regards is based on the lemon (Lexicon Model for Ontologies) framework (McCrae et al., 2012). Our view is that the written/spoken usage and the origin of the word are properties under the linguistic description module of lemon outside its core. These will be used by the phrase-structure module in identifying well-formed phrases. The word root is related to the morphology module and is used in inflection while the most common morphological form is the main lexical entry in the core for the word in concern. The gender information is useful for inflection in the morphology module and in recognizing words that do not have certain morphological forms. (e.g., රැජිණ - rajina - the queen doe</context>

Therefore, it is possible, in rare conditions, for two contributors to make contradictory updates in the database. In the context of our system, these inconsistencies can be resolved later, generally in evaluation. Moreover any inconsistencies do not affect the releases of the Sinhala WordNet as they use the text database, assuming that any contradictions are resolved before a release. We concluded that the advantages of NoSQL databases outweigh their disadvantages and decided to use one. We selected the MongoDB NoSQL (Plugge et al, 2010) system. Table 1 shows the schema we used for nouns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a NoSQL database has been used in developing a WordNet. Currently, the source repository is maintained as a private GitHub project. We will make it public in the near future. 4 The Crowdsourcing System 4.1 Overview As mentioned earlier, a crowdsourcing system to facilitate the development of the Sinhala WordNet was designed and implemented as a part of the project.

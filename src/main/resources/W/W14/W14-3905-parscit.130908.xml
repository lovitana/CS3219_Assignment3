Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998813125">
Immigrant communities host multilingual
speakers who switch across languages
and cultures in their daily communication
practices. Although there are in-depth
linguistic descriptions of code-switching
across different multilingual communica-
tion settings, there is a need for au-
tomatic prediction of code-switching in
large datasets. We use emoticons and
multi-word expressions as novel features
to predict code-switching in a large online
discussion forum for the Turkish-Dutch
immigrant community in the Netherlands.
Our results indicate that multi-word ex-
pressions are powerful features to predict
code-switching.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999955666666667">
Multilingualism is the norm rather than an ex-
ception in face-to-face and online communica-
tion for millions of speakers around the world
(Auer and Wei, 2007). 50% of the EU popula-
tion is bilingual or multilingual (European Comis-
sion, 2012). Multilingual speakers in immigrant
communities switch across different languages
and cultures depending on the social and contex-
tual factors present in the communication envi-
ronment (Auer, 1988; Myers-Scotton, 2002; Ro-
maine, 1995; Toribio, 2002; Bullock and Toribio,
2009). Example (1) illustrates Turkish-Dutch
code-switching in a post about video games in an
online discussion forum for the Turkish immigrant
community in the Netherlands.

Mixing two or more languages is not a random
process. There are in-depth linguistic descriptions
of code-switching across different multilingual
contexts (Poplack, 1980; Silva-Corval´an, 1994;
Owens and Hassan, 2013). Although these studies
provide invaluable insights about code-switching
from a variety of aspects, there is a growing need
for computational analysis of code-switching in
large datasets (e.g. social media) where man-
ual analysis is not feasible. In immigrant set-
tings, multilingual/bilingual speakers switch be-
tween minority (e.g. Turkish) and majority (e.g.
Dutch) languages. Code-switching marks multi-
lingual, multi-cultural (Luna et al., 2008; Gros-
jean, 2014) and ethnic identities (De Fina, 2007)
of the speakers. By predicting code-switching
patterns in Turkish-Dutch social media data, we
aim to raise consciousness about mixed language
communication patterns in immigrant communi-
ties. Our study is innovative in the following ways:

Code-switching in sociolinguistics There is
rarely any consensus on the terminology about
mixed language use. Wei (1998) considers al-
ternations between languages at or above clause
levels as code-mixing. Romaine (1995) refers to
both inter-sentential and intra-sentential switches
as code-switching. Bilingual speakers may shift
from one language to another entirely (Poplack et
al., 1988) or they mix languages partially within
the single speech (Gumperz, 1982). In this study,
we focus on code-switching within the same post
in an online discussion forum used by Turkish-
Dutch bilinguals.
There are different theoretical models which
support (Myers-Scotton, 2002; Poplack, 1980) or
reject (MacSwan, 2005; Thomason and Kaufman,
2001) linguistic constraints on code-switching.
According to (Thomason and Kaufman, 2001;
Gardner-Chloros and Edwards, 2004) linguistic
factors are mostly unpredictable since social fac-
tors govern the multilingual environments in most
cases. Bhatt and Bolonyai (2011) have an exten-
sive study on socio-cognitive factors that lead to
code-switching across different multilingual com-
munities.
Although multilingual communication has been
widely studied through spoken data analyses, re-
search on online communication is relatively re-
cent. In terms of linguistic factors C´ardenas-
Claros and Isharyanti (2009) report differences
between Indonesian-English and Spanish-English
speakers in their amount of code-switching on
MSN (an instant messaging client). Durham
(2003) finds a tendency to switch to English over
time in an online multilingual (German, French,
Italian) discussion forum in Switzerland.
The media (e.g. IRC, Usenet, email, online
discussions) used for multilingual conversations
influence the amount of code-switching as well
(Paolillo, 2001; Hinrichs, 2006). Androutsopou-
los and Hinnenkamp (2001), Tsaliki (2003) and
Hinnenkamp (2008) have done qualitative anal-
yses of switch patterns across German-Greek-
Turkish, Greek-English and Turkish-German in
online environments respectively.
In terms of social factors, a number of studies
have investigated the link between topic and lan-
guage choices qualitatively (Ho, 2007; Androut-
sopoulos, 2007; Tang et al., 2011). These stud-
ies share the similar conclusion that multilingual
speakers use minority languages to discuss topics
related to their ethnic identity and reinforcing inti-
macy and self-disclosure (e.g. homeland, cultural
traditions, joke telling) whereas they use the ma-
jority language for sports, education, world poli-
tics, science and technology.
Computational approaches to code-switching
Recently, an increasing number of research within
NLP has focused on dealing with multilingual
documents. For example, corpora with multilin-
gual documents have been created to support stud-
ies on code-switching (e.g. Cotterell et al. (2014))
To enable the automatic processing and analysis
of documents with mixed languages, there is a
shift in focus toward language identification at the
word level (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen and
Do˘gru¨oz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014). Most closely re-
lated to our work is the study by Solorio and Liu
(2008) who predict code-switching in recorded
English-Spanish conversations. Compared to their
work, we use a large-scale social media dataset
that enables us to explore novel features.
The task most closely related to automatic pre-
diction of code-switching is automatic language
identification (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen and
Do˘gru¨oz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014). While automatic
language detection uses the words to identify the
language, automatic prediction of code-switching
involves predicting whether the language of the
next word is the same without having access to the
next word itself.
Language practices of the Turkish community
in the Netherlands Turkish has been in con-
tact with Dutch due to labor immigration since
the 1960s and the Turkish community is the
largest minority group (2% of the whole popula-
tion) in the Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de
Statistiek, 2013). In addition to their Dutch flu-
ency, second and third generations are also fluent
in Turkish through speaking it within the family
and community, regular family visits to Turkey
and watching Turkish TV through satellite dishes.
These speakers grow up speaking both languages
simultaneously rather than learning one language
after the other (De Houwer, 2009). In addition
to constant switches between Turkish and Dutch,
there are also literally translated Dutch multi-word
expressions (Do˘gru¨oz and Backus, 2007; Do˘gru¨oz
and Backus, 2009). Due to the religious back-
grounds of the Turkish-Dutch community, Arabic

<bodyText confidence="0.9987046">
words and phrases (e.g. greetings) are part of daily
communication. In addition, English words and
phrases are used both in Dutch and Turkish due to
the exposure to American and British media.
Although the necessity of studying immigrant
languages in Dutch online environments has been
voiced earlier (Dorleijn and Nortier, 2012), the
current study is the first to investigate mixed lan-
guage communication patterns of Turkish-Dutch
bilinguals in online environments.

<bodyText confidence="0.9984235">
Our data comes from a large online forum
(Hababam) used by Turkish-Dutch speakers. The
forum is active since 2000 and contains 28 sub-
forums on a variety of topics (e.g. sports, poli-
tics, education). Each subforum consists of mul-
tiple threads which start with a thread title (e.g. a
statement or question) posted by a moderator or
user. The users are Turkish-Dutch bilinguals who
reside in the Netherlands. Although Dutch and
Turkish are used dominantly in the forum, English
(e.g. fixed expressions) and Arabic (e.g. prayers)
are occasionally used (less than 1%) as well. We
collected the data between June 2005 and October
2012 by crawling the forum. Statistics of our data
are shown in Table 1.

The subforums Chit-Chat (1,671,436), Turkish
youth &amp; love (447,436), and Turkish news &amp; up-
dates (418,135) have the highest post frequency
whereas Columns (4727), Science &amp; Philosophy
(5083) and Other Beliefs (6914) have the lowest
post frequency.
An automatic language identification tagger is
used to label the language of the words in posts
and titles of the threads. The tagger distinguishes
between Turkish and Dutch using logistic regres-
sion (Nguyen and Do˘gru¨oz, 2013) and achieves
a word accuracy of approximately 97%. We use
the language labels to train our classifier (since
given the labels we can determine whether there
is a switch or not), and to evaluate our model.

4 Types of Code-Switching
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
In this section, we provide a qualitative analysis of
code-switching in the online forum. We differen-
tiate between two types of code-switching: code-
switching across posts and code-switching within
the same post.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99981">
4.1 Code-switching across posts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982988736842106">
Within the same discussion thread, users react
to posts of other users in different languages.
In example (2), user 1 posts in Dutch to tease
User 2. User 2 reacts to this message with a
humorous idiomatic expression in Turkish (i.e.
[adim cikmis] “I made a name”) to indirectly
emphasize that there is no reason for her to defend
herself since she has already become famous as
the perfect person in the online community. This
type of humorous switch has also been observed
for Greek-English code-switching in face-to-face
communication (Gardner-Chloros and Finnis,
2003). The text is written with Dutch orthography
instead of conventional Turkish orthography (i.e.
[adım c¸ıkmıs¸]). It is probably the case that the user
has a Dutch keyboard without Turkish characters.
However, writing with non-Turkish characters in
online environments is also becoming popular
among monolingual Turkish users from Turkey.
Example (2)
User1: &lt;dutch&gt; je hoefde niet gelijk in de
verdediging te schieten hoor &lt;/dutch&gt; :P
Tra: “you do not need to be immediately
defensive dear”
User2: &lt;turkish&gt; zaten adim cikmis
mukemmel sahane kusursuz insana, bi de
yine cikmasin &lt;/turkish&gt; :(
Tra: “I already have established a name as a
great amazing perfect person, I do not need
it to spread around once more”
Example (3) is taken from a thread about break-
fast traditions. The users have posted what they
had for breakfast that day. The first user talks
about his breakfast in Turkish and describes the
culture specific food items (e.g. borek “Turkish
pastry”) prepared by his mother. The second user
describes a typical Dutch breakfast and therefore
switches to Dutch.

4.2 Code-switching within the same post
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999451333333333">
In addition to code-switching across posts, we en-
countered code-switching within the same post of
a user as well. Manual annotation of a subset of
the posts in Nguyen and Do˘gru¨oz (2013), suggests
that less than 20% of the posts contain a switch.
Example (4) is taken from a thread about Mother’s
Day and illustrates an intra-sentential switch. The
user starts the post in Dutch (vakantie boeken “to
book a vacation”) and switches to Turkish since
booking a vacation through internet sites or a
travel agency is a typical activity associated with
the Dutch culture.

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.979174357142857">
Example (5) is taken from a thread about Turk-
ish marriages and illustrates an inter-sentential
switch. The user is advising the other users
in Turkish to be very careful about choosing
their partners. Since most Turkish community
members prefer Turkish partners and follow
Turkish traditions for marriage, she talks about
these topics in Turkish. However, she switches
to Dutch when she talks about getting a diploma
in the Dutch school system. Similar examples of
code-switching for emphasizing different identi-
ties based on topic have been observed for other
online and face-to-face communication as well
(Androutsopoulos, 2007; Gardner-Chloros, 2009).

5 Experimental Setup
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928666666667">
The focus of this paper is on code-switching
within the same post. We discuss the setup and
features of our experiment in this section.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.907633">
5.1 Goal
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981727272727">
We cast the prediction of the code-switch point
within the post as a binary classification problem.
We define the i-th token of the post as an instance.
If the i + 1th token is in a different language, the
label is 1. Otherwise, the label is 0.
Obtaining language labels In order to label
each token of a post, we rely on the labels ob-
tained using automatic language identification at
the word level (see Section 3). This process may
not be the most accurate way of labeling each to-
ken of a post at a large scale. One particular arti-
fact of this procedure is that an automatic tagger
may falsely tag the language of a token in longer
posts. As a result, some lengthy posts might ap-
pear to have one or more code-switches by ac-
cident. However, since the accuracy of our tag-
ger is high (approx. 97% accuracy), we expect
the amount of such spurious code-switches to be
low. For future work, we plan to experiment on a
dataset based on automatic language identification
as well as a smaller dataset using manual annota-
tion.

5.2 Creating train and test sets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999848714285714">
Before we attempt to train a classifier on our data,
we eliminate the biases and imbalances. The ma-
jority of posts do not contain any switches. As a
consequence, the number of instances that belong
to the ‘0’ class (i.e. no code-switching occurring
after the current word) grossly outnumber the in-
stances of class ‘1’, where code-switching takes
place. In order to alleviate this class imbalance, for
all our experiments, we sample an equal amount
of instances from ‘0’ and ‘1’ classes randomly 2,
both for our training and testing data. This way
the result will not favor the ‘0’ class even if we
randomly decide on the class label for each in-
stance. The average number of training and testing

instances per iteration was 4000 and 80000 respec-
tively. By drawing 100 independent samples from
the entire dataset, we cover a reasonable portion of
the full data and do not sacrifice the balance of the
two classes, which is crucially important for the
validity of our results.

5.3 Feature selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999485">
We use the following features (see Table 2) to in-
vestigate code-switching within a post.
</bodyText>
<subsubsectionHeader confidence="0.645776">
5.3.1 Non-linguistic features
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915977272728">
Emoticons Emoticons are iconic symbols that
convey emotional information along with lan-
guage use in online environments (Dresner and
Herring, 2014). Emoticons have mostly been used
in the context of sentiment analysis (e.g. Volkova
et al. (2013), Chmiel et al. (2011)). Park et al.
(2014) studied how the use of emoticons differ
across cultures in Twitter data. Panayiotou (2004)
studied how bilinguals express emotions in face-
to-face environments in different languages. We
are the first to investigate the role of emoticons as a
non-linguistic factor in predicting code-switching
on social media.
Emoticons in our data are either signified by
a special tag [smiley:smiley type] or can
appear in any of the common ASCII emoticon
forms (e.g. :), :-) etc.). In order to detect the
emoticons, we used a hand picked list of ASCII
emoticons as our dictionary, as well as a filter that
searched for the special emoticon tag. Since we
rely on an automatic language tagger, the language
label of a particular emoticon depends on its sur-
rounding tokens. If an emoticon is within a block
of text that is tagged as Turkish, then the emoticon
will automatically obtain a Turkish label (and ac-
cordingly for Dutch). For future work, we will ex-
periment with labeling emoticons differently (e.g.
introducing a third, neutral label).
To assess the strength of emoticons as predic-
tors of code-switching, we generate 4 different
features (see Table 2). These features capture
whether or not there is an emoticon at or before
the token that we want to classify as the switch
boundary between Dutch and Turkish. We record
whether there was an emoticon at token i (i.e. the
token we want to classify), token i − 1 and token
i − 2.
The last emoticon feature records whether there
is any emoticon after the current token. We note
that this feature looks ahead (after the i-th token),
and therefore cannot be implemented in a real time
system which predicts code-switching on-the-fly.
However, we included the feature for exploratory
purposes.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.615439">
5.3.2 Linguistic features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998739577777778">
Language around the switch point We also in-
vestigate whether the knowledge of the language
of a couple of tokens before the token of inter-
est, as well as the language at the token of inter-
est, hold some predictive strength. These features
correspond to #1-3 in Table 2. Generally, the lan-
guage label is binary. However, if there are no to-
kens in positions i − 2 or i − 1 for features #1
and #2, we assign a third value to represent this
non-existence. Additionally, we explore whether
a previous code-switching in a post triggers a sec-
ond code-switching later in the same post. We test
this hypothesis by recording feature #4 which rep-
resents the existence of code-switching before to-
ken i.
Single word versus multi-word switch There
is an on-going discussion in multilingualism about
the classification of switched tokens (Poplack,
2004; Poplack, 2013) and whether there are
linguistic constraints on the switches (Myers-
Scotton, 2002). In addition to switches across in-
dividual lexical tokens, multilingual speakers also
switch across multi-word expressions.
Automatic identification of multi-word expres-
sions in monolingual language use have been
widely discussed (Baldwin et al., 2003; Baldwin
and Kim, 2010) but we know little about how to
predict switch points that include multi-word ex-
pressions. We are the first to include multi-word
expressions as a feature to predict code-switching.
We are mostly inspired by (Schwartz et al., 2013)
in identifying MWEs.
More specifically, we built a corpus of 3-gram
MWEs (2,241,484 in total) and selected the most
frequent 100 MWEs. We differentiate between
two types of MWEs: Let the i-th token of a post
be the switch point. For type 1, we take 3 tokens
(all in the same language) right before the switch
token (i.e. terms i − 3, i − 2, i −1). [Allah razi ol-
sun] “May the Lord be with you” and [met je eens]
“agree with you” are the two of the most frequent
MWEs (in Turkish and Dutch respectively).
For type 2, we take the tokens i − 2, i − 1, i
and the last token is in a different language (e.g.
[Turkse premier Recep] “Turkish prime-minister

The first type of MWEs captures whether an
MWE (all three words in the same language), sig-
nifies code-switching for token i or not.
The second type investigates whether there are
MWEs that “spill over” the code-switching point
(i.e. the first two tokens of an MWE are in the
same language, but the third token is in another

MWEs in our corpus, we count the occurrences of
all these 3-grams and keep the top scoring ones in
terms of frequency, which end up as our dictionary

To evaluate the predictive strength of our features,
we conduct experiments using a Naive Bayes clas-
sifier.
In order to measure the performance, we train
the classifiers for various combinations of the fea-
tures shown in Table 2. As we described in the pre-
vious section, we train on randomly chosen, class-
balanced parts of the data and we test on randomly
selected balanced samples (disjoint from the train-
ing set), averaging over 100 runs. For each com-
bination of features, we measure and report aver-
age precision, recall, and F1-score, with respect to
positively predicting code-switching.
Table 3 illustrates the performance of individ-
ual features used in our classifier. Features that
concern the language of the previous tokens (i.e.
features #1 &amp; #2) seem to perform better than
chance in predicting code-switching. On the other
hand, features #3 (language of the token in posi-
tion i) and #4 (previous code-switching) have the
worst performance. In fact, the obtained classi-

fier always predicts no code-switching regardless
of the value of the feature. Therefore, both pre-
cision and recall are 0. Features #1 &amp; #2 behave
differently from features #3 &amp; #4 because #1 &amp; #2
have ternary values (the token language, or non-
existing). This probably forces the classifiers to
produce a non-constant decision. For instance, the
model for feature #1 decides positively for code-
switching if the language label is either Turkish or
Dutch and decides negatively if the label is non-
existing.
The rest of the individual features perform sim-
ilarly but worse than #1 and #2. Therefore, it is
necessary to use a combination of features instead
of single ones.
After examining how features perform individu-
ally, we further investigate how features behave in
groups. We first group the features into homoge-
nous categories (e.g. #1-#3 focus on the language
of tokens, #5-#8 record the presence of emoticons
and #9-#11 refer to MWEs). Subsequently, we
test the performance of these categories in differ-
ent combinations, and finally measure the effect of

using all our features for the task. Table 4 shows
the combinations of the features we used, as well
as the average precision, recall, and F1-score.
According to Table 4, the combination of the
language of the tokens (features #1-#3) and the
previous code-switching earlier in the post (fea-
tures #1-#4), and MWEs (features #9-#11) per-
form the highest in terms of precision/recall. Fea-
tures #3 and #4 have rather low performances on
their own but they yield a strong classifier in com-
bination with other features.
When we use features that record emoticons
(#5-#8) or MWEs (#9-#11) alone, the performance
of our classifier decreases. In general, MWEs out-
perform emoticons. We observe this performance
boost when we combine emoticon features with
other features (e.g. #1-#8) and with MWEs to-
gether in the same subset (#1-#4, #9-#11).

<bodyText confidence="0.999956615384615">
We focused on predicting code-switching points
for a mixed language online forum used by
the Turkish-Dutch immigrant community in the
Netherlands. For the first time, a long term data
set was used to investigate code-switching in so-
cial media. We are also the first to test new fea-
tures (e.g. emoticons and MWEs) to predict code-
switching and to identify the features with sig-
nificant predictive strength. For future work, we
will continue our investigation with exploring the
predictive value of these new features within the
Turkish-Dutch immigrant community as well as
others.

The user is advising the other users in Turkish to be very careful about choosing their partners. Since most Turkish community members prefer Turkish partners and follow Turkish traditions for marriage, she talks about these topics in Turkish. However, she switches to Dutch when she talks about getting a diploma in the Dutch school system. Similar examples of code-switching for emphasizing different identities based on topic have been observed for other online and face-to-face communication as well (Androutsopoulos, 2007; Gardner-Chloros, 2009).

Computational approaches to code-switching Recently, an increasing number of research within NLP has focused on dealing with multilingual documents. For example, corpora with multilingual documents have been created to support studies on code-switching (e.g. Cotterell et al. (2014)) To enable the automatic processing and analysis of documents with mixed languages, there is a shift in focus toward language identification at the word level (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen and Do˘gru¨oz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014). Most closely related to our work is the study by Solorio and Liu (2008) who predict code-switching in recorded English-Spanish conversations. Compared to their work, we use a large-scale social media dataset that enables us to explore novel features. The task most closely related to automatic prediction of code-switching is automatic language identification (King and </context>

In addition to constant switches between Turkish and Dutch, there are also literally translated Dutch multi-word expressions (Do˘gru¨oz and Backus, 2007; Do˘gru¨oz and Backus, 2009). Due to the religious backgrounds of the Turkish-Dutch community, Arabic 43 words and phrases (e.g. greetings) are part of daily communication. In addition, English words and phrases are used both in Dutch and Turkish due to the exposure to American and British media. Although the necessity of studying immigrant languages in Dutch online environments has been voiced earlier (Dorleijn and Nortier, 2012), the current study is the first to investigate mixed language communication patterns of Turkish-Dutch bilinguals in online environments. 3 Dataset Our data comes from a large online forum (Hababam) used by Turkish-Dutch speakers. The forum is active since 2000 and contains 28 subforums on a variety of topics (e.g. sports, politics, education).

Emoticons have mostly been used in the context of sentiment analysis (e.g. Volkova et al. (2013), Chmiel et al. (2011)). Park et al. (2014) studied how the use of emoticons differ across cultures in Twitter data. Panayiotou (2004) studied how bilinguals express emotions in faceto-face environments in different languages. We are the first to investigate the role of emoticons as a non-linguistic factor in predicting code-switching on social media. Emoticons in our data are either signified by a special tag [smiley:smiley type] or can appear in any of the common ASCII emoticon forms (e.g. :), :</context>

In example (2), user 1 posts in Dutch to tease User 2. User 2 reacts to this message with a humorous idiomatic expression in Turkish (i.e. [adim cikmis] “I made a name”) to indirectly emphasize that there is no reason for her to defend herself since she has already become famous as the perfect person in the online community. This type of humorous switch has also been observed for Greek-English code-switching in face-to-face communication (Gardner-Chloros and Finnis, 2003). The text is written with Dutch orthography instead of conventional Turkish orthography (i.e. [adım c¸ıkmıs¸]). It is probably the case that the user has a Dutch keyboard without Turkish characters. However, writing with non-Turkish characters in online environments is also becoming popular among monolingual Turkish users from Turkey.

Although these studies provide invaluable insights about code-switching from a variety of aspects, there is a growing need for computational analysis of code-switching in large datasets (e.g. social media) where manual analysis is not feasible. In immigrant settings, multilingual/bilingual speakers switch between minority (e.g. Turkish) and majority (e.g. Dutch) languages. Code-switching marks multilingual, multi-cultural (Luna et al., 2008; Grosjean, 2014) and ethnic identities (De Fina, 2007) of the speakers. By predicting code-switching patterns in Turkish-Dutch social media data, we aim to raise consciousness about mixed language communication patterns in immigrant communities. Our study is innovative in the following ways: • We performed experiments on the longest and largest bilingual dataset analyzed so far. • We are the first to predict code-switching in social media data which allow us to investigate features such as emoticons. • We are the first to exploit multi-word expressions to predict code-switching. • We use automatic language id</context>

Our results indicate that multi-word expressions are powerful features to predict code-switching. 1 Introduction Multilingualism is the norm rather than an exception in face-to-face and online communication for millions of speakers around the world (Auer and Wei, 2007). 50% of the EU population is bilingual or multilingual (European Comission, 2012). Multilingual speakers in immigrant communities switch across different languages and cultures depending on the social and contextual factors present in the communication environment (Auer, 1988; Myers-Scotton, 2002; Romaine, 1995; Toribio, 2002; Bullock and Toribio, 2009). Example (1) illustrates Turkish-Dutch code-switching in a post about video games in an online discussion forum for the Turkish immigrant community in the Netherlands. Example (1) user1: &lt;dutch&gt;vette spellllllllll &lt;/dutch&gt;.. &lt;turkish&gt;bir girdimmi cikamiyomm .. yendikce yenesi geliyo insanin&lt;/turkish&gt; Translation: &lt;dutch&gt; awesome gameeeee &lt;/dutch&gt;.. &lt;turkish&gt;once you are in it, it is hard to leave.. the more you win, the more you want to win&lt;/turkish&gt; Mixing two or more languages is not a random process.

Multilingual speakers in immigrant communities switch across different languages and cultures depending on the social and contextual factors present in the communication environment (Auer, 1988; Myers-Scotton, 2002; Romaine, 1995; Toribio, 2002; Bullock and Toribio, 2009).

More specifically, we built a corpus of 3-gram MWEs (2,241,484 in total) and selected the most frequent 100 MWEs. We differentiate between two types of MWEs: Let the i-th token of a post be the switch point. For type 1, we take 3 tokens (all in the same language) right before the switch token (i.e. terms i − 3, i − 2, i −1). [Allah razi olsun] “May the Lord be with you” and [met je eens] “agree with you” are the two of the most frequent MWEs (in Turkish and Dutch respectively).

Computational approaches to code-switching Recently, an increasing number of research within NLP has focused on dealing with multilingual documents. For example, corpora with multilingual documents have been created to support studies on code-switching (e.g. Cotterell et al. (2014)) To enable the automatic processing and analysis of documents with mixed languages, there is a shift in focus toward language identification at the word level (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen and Do˘gru¨oz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014). Most closely related to our work is the study by Solorio and Liu (2008) who predict code-switching in recorded English-Spanish conversations. Compared to their work, we use a large-scale social media dataset that enables us to explore novel features. The task most closely related to automatic prediction of code-switching is automatic language identification (King and Abney, 2013; Nguyen and Do˘gru¨oz, 2013; Lui et al., 2014). While automatic language detection uses the words to identify the language, automatic prediction of code-switching involves predicting whether the language of the next word is the same without having access to the next word itself.

Emoticons have mostly been used in the context of sentiment analysis (e.g. Volkova et al. (2013), Chmiel et al. (2011)). Park et al. (2014) studied how the use of emoticons differ across cultures in Twitter data. Panayiotou (2004) studied how bilinguals express emotions in faceto-face environments in different languages. We are the first to investigate the role of emoticons as a non-linguistic factor in predicting code-switching on social media. Emoticons in our data are either signified by a special tag [smiley:smiley type] or can appear in any of the common ASCII emoticon forms (e.g. :), :-) etc.).

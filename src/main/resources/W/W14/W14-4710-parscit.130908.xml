This paper presents our relations-oriented approach to the shared task on lexical access in lan-
guage production, as well as the results we obtained. We relied mainly on the semantic and
lexical relations between words as they are recorded in the Princeton WordNet, although also
considering co-occurrence in the Google n-gram corpus. After the end of the shared task we con-
tinued working on the system and the further adjustments (involving part of speech information
and position of the candidate in the synset) and those results are presented as well.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999492363636364">
In this paper we present our experience in the shared task on lexical access in language production,
organized as part of the CogALex workshop. Given a list of five words (let us call them seeds), the
system should return a word (we will call it target) which is assumed to be the most closely associated
to all the seeds. Two remarks are worth being made here: on the one hand, what we call word is in fact
a word form, as inflected forms are both among the seeds and among the expected targets in the training
and the test sets. On the other hand, the closeness of association remains understated by the organizers.
It can be understood at several levels, given our analysis of the training data: the meaning and/or the
form, the syntagmatic associations, i.e. associations of words in texts. However, our system dealt mainly
with the semantic level. The form level is involved only to the extent to which lexical relations (usually
derivational relations and antonymy) in Princeton WordNet (PWN) are used. The syntagmatic relations
we use are the co-occurrences in the Google n-gram corpus

2 Our understanding of the lexical access task
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999275">
Having already established what meaning we, as speakers, want to render, the lexical choice is influenced
by several factors: the person we talk to, the circumstances (place, other participants) of our discussion,
the social (or even other types of) relations between the participants to the discussion. The shared task
focuses on the tip of the tongue (TOT) phenomenon, as rightly described in the shared task presentation:
we do not remember the word “mocha”, but we want to express the idea (i.e., the meaning) “superior
dark coffee made of beans from Arabia”. In a real life conversation, dealing with TOT is much simpler:
the speaker (the one affected by TOT) has the ability of defining the word s/he is looking for or of
enumerating some words AND specifying the relation(s) they establish with the looked for word. Thus,
we consider that the task here, consisting of being able to find the target when receiving five seeds,
does not mimic the real life situation. In fact, we deprive the system of vital information that, we, as
speakers, possess, to our great advantage reflected in our success in dealing with the TOT problem, after
all. Moreover, given the information provided by the organizers once the results were send, the seeds that
we received are derived from the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus, so they are, in fact, the associations
introduced by the users to a seed. So, the organizers implicitly considered the association of two words
is the same, irrespective of which of them is the seed and which is the target, which is definitely not the
same, especially if the association is a syntagmatic one.

In a recent experiment (Zock and Shcwab, 2013), a set of seeds (called stimuli therein) is presented to a
system and, relying on information available in the eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea, 2001) and in DBpedia,
a list of words is returned. The authors explain the bad results by the small dimensions of the eXtended
WordNet and by the small number of syntagmatic relations it contains. Although they emphasize the
necessity of using big corpora, with heterogenous data, to help solve the TOT problem, the conclusions
speculate about various elements that can lead to, but do not guarantee the success:

4 Our approach
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995967">
4.1 The data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964681">
The training set contains a list of 2000 pairs of five seeds and the target. They look quite heterogeneous:
there are content and functional words alike, lemmas and inflected forms (see “occurs — happens happen
often sometimes now”), capitalized (sometimes unnecessarily, for example “Nevertheless” in the pair
“however — but never Nevertheless when although”) and uncapitalized words.
Interestingly, two different inflected forms are targets of (partially) different sets of seeds: compare:
occur — happen event often perfume today
with
occurs — happens happen often sometimes now.
This means that not only semantic relations are established between the seed and the target, but also
grammatical ones.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99405">
4.2 Assumptions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992985">
In order to construct our system we made the assumption, supported by the manual analysis of the
training set, that the seeds and the target are related to each other by different kinds of relations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999947555555555">
• semantic relations;
• co-occurrence, in either order;
• syntactic relations;
• gloss-like relations, i.e. the target may be defined using one or more seeds;
• domain relations, i.e. the target and at least some seeds may belong to the same domain;
• form relation, i.e. the target and one or more seeds may display a partial identity of form (and
sometimes even of the acoustic form of words);
• inflection as a relation among forms of the same word;
• etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.904588833333333">
Given these, we were aware of the impossibility of dealing with cases involving inflected forms, some
of them occurring as seeds, while one occurs as target, such as:
am — I not is me are.
In this case, an inflectional relation can be found between “is” and “am” and between “are” and
“am”, whereas the relations between “am” and “I” and between “am” and “not” are syntagmatic (co-
occurrences). No relation can we identify between “am” and “me”.

4.3 Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915">
As a consequence of the assumptions made, the language resources we used for the competition were
the Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) and Google n-grams corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006).
The implied limitations of our approach are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997852428571429">
• the impossibility of dealing with pairs involving only inflected words (as in the previous example)
or only functional words (as in the case: “at ∼ home by here in on”);
• no contribution made by some of the seeds in the process of finding the target;
• the partial dealing with inflected forms such as plurals, third person singular of verbs, gerunds, as
they cannot be found in PWN; the only source of information about them is the n-grams corpus;
• some combinations (although quite frequent, according to our intuitions obout the language) cannot
be found in the Google n-gram corpus.

<bodyText confidence="0.91589125">
For all (2000x5) pairs seed-target in the training set we extracted from PWN the shortest relations chains,
as a kind of lexical chains (Moldovan and Novischi, 2002), existing between them, disregarding the part
of speech of the words. These chains are made up of both semantic and lexical relations (as they are de-
fined in the wordnet literature, i.e. lexical relations are established between word forms, while semantic

count for a significant number of pairs: 1213. Almost half of these cases (510) are solved by only one of
the two relations (328 by hyponymy alone and 182 by hypernymy alone). Moreover, these relations con-
tribute also in chains involving the derivat relation. So, we can consider them the most useful ones. (Our
finding is similar to the weight associated to these relations by Moldovan and Novischi (Moldovan and

We reformulated this as a classification problem. Assuming that having a list of seeds and the list of
their possible candidates, the problem will be solved by considering the most probable candidate as the
closest to all seeds. We chose valid and invalid as classification categories.
The system uses the machine learning technique called Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt for
short) and the features needed by MaxEnt are extracted from the kinds of relations presented above, in
subsection 4.2. In other words, we mapped each kind of relation to a feature. The entire process has two
distinct phases: training and prediction.
The training mechanism is presented in Figure 1. For each training set entry (i.e. the list of 5 seeds and
the expected target) a list of possible candidates is generated using the PWN relations chains presented
above. We called this process Candidate Criteria. Combining each set of seeds with their candidates we
extracted the list of features needed to enter into the MaxEnt process to create the model. For instance,
giving the sequence of seeds away fonder illness leave presence and two possible candi-
dates absence and being we obtained the following lists of features ending with the corresponding
classification category:
domain=s factotum domain=t factotum src=1 wn=an wn=he he ho ho
wnshort=he ho valid
domain=s factotum domain=t factotum src=1 wn=he ho d d invalid
The following list of features were used:

• wn=chain: chain represents the relations chain found between any seed and the current candidate.
We used short forms to label relations: for example, an stands for antonymy, he for hypernymy,
ho for hyponymy, d for derivational relation;
• form=first upper when at least one seed and the candidate begin with a capital letter; we did
not allow for candidates with initial capital letter unless at least one seed had an initial capital letter;
• src=n marks the number n of seeds that reached the candidate using the PWN chains. In the case
of the seed presence and candidate absence there are two chains linking the two words: an
and he he ho ho and only presence contributes to them;
• gloss=n marks the number n of seeds that occur in the target gloss;
• n2gram=high used when any seed occurs in any Google 2-grams with the candidate;
• domain=s domain used to mark the seed domain(s);
• domain=t domain used to mark the candidate domain(s);
• wnshort=short chain here the short chain represents a reduced version of the PWN chain.
For example, the chain he he ho ho can be reduced to he ho (or to a co-hyponym relation, in
an extended meaning). The reason is to create an invariant chain that can hold irrespectively of the
number of similar consecutive relations. This is useful in hierarchies involving many scientific or
artificial nodes which are not known or simply disregarded by common speakers. For example, the
chain between hippopotamus and animal is 7 hyponyms long in PWN, whereas for a speaker
they are in a direct relation.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999699833333333">
The selection of candidates is done using exclusively the PWN relations chains with a maximun length
of 5 relations in a chain and only the first literal from the target synset is taken into account (on the
assumption that literals PWN synsets are in reverse order of their frequency of occurrence in corpora,
with the first as the most frequent). To reduce the number of possible candidates some filtering criteria
are applied before pairing them with their corresponding seeds to extract the features described above.
These criteria are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993631">
• the candidates that appear among seeds are eliminated;
• the compound terms (recognized by the use of underscore among elements) are excluded;
• the candidates should appear together with any seed among Google 5-grams with a minimum fre-
quency of 5000 (occurrences).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999745666666667">
The prediction phase takes the test set and, using the model created in the training phase, produces for
each candidate a percent for each category (valid / invalid). The candidate selection and features
extraction are done similarly to the training phase. The prediction phase is presented in Figure 2. The
result of this phase is a list of candidates (sorted in reverse order) for each set of 5 seeds in the test set.
The list of results presented to the shared task organizers contains, for each set of seeds, the best ranked
candidate.

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
We presented here the way we dealt with the challenging task proposed by the organizers. Although
initially we intended to consider using a large corpus (ukWAC) as well for finding candidates, we found
ourselves in the technical impossibility of doing so, because of the costly (timewise especially) resources
required by its processing. What is left to be checked is to what extent the lexical and syntactic patterns
that can be extracted from a corpus help us improve the results.
We cannot boast good results of our approach mainly because we used only a dictionary (in the form
of the PWN). Although it was created on psychological principles about the way words are structured in
the speakers’ mind, it cannot ensure satisfying results. At least within our approach, the contribution of
the relations encoded in PWN is very low. An evaluation of the type n top-ranked candidates could have
a higher accuracy for our type of approach. We could dare say that our approach was a further proof of
the statement tested by (Zock and Shcwab, 2013): “Words storage does not guarantee their access”.

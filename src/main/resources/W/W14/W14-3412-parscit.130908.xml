Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999774">
The dual process model (Evans, 2008)
posits two types of decision-making,
which may be ordered on a continuum
from intuitive to analytical (Hammond,
1981). This work uses a dataset of nar-
rated image-based clinical reasoning, col-
lected from physicians as they diagnosed
dermatological cases presented as images.
Two annotators with training in cognitive
psychology assigned each narrative a rat-
ing on a four-point decision scale, from in-
tuitive to analytical. This work discusses
the annotation study, and makes contribu-
tions for resource creation methodology
and analysis in the clinical domain.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904756756757">
Physicians make numerous diagnoses daily, and
consequently clinical decision-making strate-
gies are much discussed (e.g., Norman, 2009;
Croskerry, 2003, 2009). Dual process theory pro-
poses that decision-making may be broadly cat-
egorized as intuitive or analytical (Kahneman &amp;
Frederick, 2002; Stanovich &amp; West, 2000). Fur-
ther, scholars argue that decision-making may be
ordered on a continuum, with intuitive and analyt-
ical at each pole (Hamm, 1988; Hammond, 1981).
Determining the decision strategies used by
physicians is of interest because certain styles may
be more appropriate for particular tasks (Ham-
mond, 1981), and better suited for expert physi-
cians rather than those in training (Norman, 2009).
Language use can provide insight into physician
decision style, as linguistic content reflects cogni-
tive processes (Pennebaker &amp; King, 1999).
While most clinical corpora focus on patients
or conditions, physician diagnostic narratives have
been successfully annotated for conceptual units
(e.g., identifying medical morphology or a differ-
ential diagnosis), by Womack et al. (2013) and
McCoy et al. (2012). Crowley et al. (2013) cre-
ated an instructional system to detect cognitive bi-
ases in clinical decision-making, while Coderre et
al. (2003) used protocol analysis on think-aloud
diagnostic narratives, and found that features of
intuitive reasoning implied diagnostic accuracy.
In this study, speech data were collected from
physicians as they diagnosed dermatological cases
presented to them as images. Physician verbaliza-
tions were annotated for decision style on a four-
point scale from intuitive to analytical (Figure 1).
Importantly, cognitive psychologists were brought
into the loop for decision style annotation, to take
advantage of their expertise in decision theory.

This work describes a thorough methodology
applied in annotating a corpus of diagnostic nar-
ratives for decision style. The corpus is a unique
resource – the first of its kind – for studying and
modeling clinical decision style or for developing
instructional systems for training clinicians to as-
sess their reasoning processes.

discussed theoretically. Thus, it responds to the
need for investigating subjective natural language
phenomena (Alm, 2011). The annotated corpus is
a springboard for decision research in medicine,
as well as other mission-critical domains in which
good decisions save lives, time, and money.
Subjective computational modeling is particu-
larly challenging because often, no real ‘ground
truth’ is available. Decision style is such a
fuzzy concept, lacking clear boundaries (Hamp-
ton, 1998), and its recognition develops in psy-
chologists over time, via exposure to knowledge
and practice in cognitive psychology. Interpreting
fuzzy decision categories also depends on mental
models which lack strong intersubjective agree-
ment. This is the nature, and challenge, of cap-
turing understandings that emerge organically.
This work’s contributions include (1) present-
ing a distinct clinical resource, (2) introducing a
robust method for fuzzy clinical annotation tasks,
(3) analyzing the annotated data comprehensively,
and (4) devising a new metric that links annotated
behavior to clinicians’ decision-making profiles.

2 Corpus Description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999791">
In an experimental data-collection setting, 29
physicians (18 residents, 11 attendings) narrated
their diagnostic thought process while inspecting
30 clinical images of dermatological cases, for a
total of 8681 narratives. Physicians described ob-
servations, differential and final diagnoses, and
confidence (out of 100%) in their final diagno-
sis. Later, narratives were assessed for correctness
(based on final diagnoses), and image cases were
evaluated for difficulty by a dermatologist.

The corpus was annotated for decision style in a
pilot study and then a main annotation study (Fig-

ure 2).2 Two annotators with graduate training
in cognitive psychology independently rated each
narrative on a four-point scale from intuitive to an-
alytical (Figure 1). The two middle labels reflect
the presence of both styles, with intuitive (BI) or
analytical (BA) reasoning being more prominent.
Since analytical reasoning involves detailed exam-
ination of alternatives, annotators were asked to
avoid using length as a proxy for decision style.
After the pilot, the annotators jointly dis-
cussed disagreements with one researcher. Inter-
annotator reliability, measured by linear weighted
kappa (Cohen, 1968), was 0.4 before and 0.8 af-
ter resolution; the latter score may be an upper
bound on agreement for clinical decision-making
annotation. As both annotators reported using
physician-provided confidence to judge decision
style, in subsequent annotation confidence men-
tions had been removed if they appeared after the
final diagnosis (most narratives), or, if intermixed
with diagnostic reasoning, replaced with dashes.
Finally, silent pauses3 were coded as ellipses to
aid in the human parsing of the narratives.

was calculated for the narratives rated twice, and
inter-annotator reliability on the initial ratings.
As shown in Table 2, reliability was moderate to
good (Altman, 1991), and inter-annotator agree-
ment was well above chance (25%). Indeed, an-
notators were in full agreement, or agreed within
one rating on the continuum, on over 90% of nar-
ratives. This pattern reveals fuzzy category bound-
aries but sufficient regularity so as to be mea-
surable. This is in line with subjective natural
language phenomena, and may be a consequence
of imposing discrete categories on a continuum.5
Annotator 1 had better intra-annotator reliability,
perhaps due to differences in annotation strategy.
5Nonetheless, affect research has shown that scalar repre-
sentations are not immune to variation issues (Alm, 2009).

5 Annotator Strategy Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983821428571">
Five questionnaires evenly spaced among the nar-
ratives asked annotators to rate how often they
used various factors in judging decision style (Ta-
ble 3). Factors were chosen based on discussion
with the annotators after the pilot, and referred to
in descriptions of decision styles in the annotator
instructions; the descriptions were based on char-
acteristics of each style in the cognitive psychol-
ogy literature (e.g., Evans, 2008). Factors with
high variability (SD columns in Table 3) reveal
changes in annotator strategy over time, and fac-
tors that may influence intra-annotator reliability.
Both annotators reported using the rel. (similar-
ity) offinal &amp; first-mentioned diagnosis, as well as
perceived attitude, perceived confidence, and use
of justification, to rate most narratives. Types of
processing were used by both sometimes; this is
important since these are central to the definitions
of decision style in decision-making theory.
Differences in strategies allow for the assess-
ment of annotators’ individual preferences. Anno-
tator 1 often considered the no. of diagnoses in the
differential, and rel. timing of the differential, but
Annotator 2 rarely attended to them; the opposite
pattern occurred with respect to switching between
decision styles, and the timing of the switch.
The shared high factors reveal those consis-
tently linked to interpreting decision style, despite

the concept’s fuzzy boundaries. In contrast, the id-
iosyncratic high factors reveal starting points for
understanding fuzzy perception, and for further
calibrating inter-annotator reliability.

6 Narrative Case Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960180466666667">
Examining particular narratives is also instructive.
Of the 86 duplicated narratives with two ratings
per annotator, extreme agreement occurred for 22
cases (26%), meaning that all four ratings were ex-
actly the same.6 Figure 3 (top) shows such a case
of intuitive reasoning: a quick decision without re-
flection or discussion of the differential. Figure
3 (middle) shows a case of analytical reasoning:
consideration of alternatives and logical inference.
Figure 3: Narratives for which annotators were in
full agreement on I (top) and A (middle) ratings,
vs. in extreme disagreement (bottom).
In the full data set (initial ratings), there were
50 cases (6%) of 2-point inter-annotator disagree-
ment and one case of 3-point inter-annotator dis-
agreement (Figure 3, bottom). This latter narra-
tive was produced by an attending (experienced
physician), 40% confident and incorrect in the fi-
nal diagnosis. Annotator 1 rated it analytical,
while Annotator 2 rated it intuitive. This is in
line with Annotator 1’s preference for analytical
ratings (Table 1). Annotator 1 may have viewed
this pattern of observation → conclusion as logi-
cal reasoning, characteristic of analytical reason-
ing. Annotator 2 may instead have interpreted the
phrase it’s so purple it makes me think of a vas-
cular tumor...so i think [...] as intuitive, due to
the makes me think comment, indicating associa-
tive reasoning, characteristic of intuitive thinking.

Annotations were also used to characterize physi-
cians’ preferred decision style. A decision score
was calculated for each physician as follows:

where p is a physician, r is a rating, n is total
images, and A1, A2 the annotators. Annotators’
initial ratings were summed – from 1 for Intuitive
to 4 for Analytical – for all image cases for each
physician, and divided by 2 times the number of
images, to normalize the score to a 4-point scale.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of decision scores
across residents and experienced attendings.
Residents exhibit greater variability in decision
style. While this might reflect that residents were
the majority group, it suggests that differences in
expertise are linked to decision styles; such differ-
ences hint at the potential benefits that could come
from preparing clinical trainees to self-monitor
their use of decision style. Interestingly, the over-
all distribution is skewed, with a slight preference
for analytical decision-making, and especially so
for attendings. This deserves future attention.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999">
This study exploited two layers of expertise:
physicians produced diagnostic narratives, and
trained cognitive psychologists annotated for de-
cision style. This work also highlights the impor-
tance of understanding annotator strategy, and fac-
tors influencing annotation, when fuzzy categories
are involved. Future work will examine the links
between decision style, expertise, and diagnostic
accuracy or difficulty.

Intra-annotator reliability was calculated for the narratives rated twice, and inter-annotator reliability on the initial ratings. As shown in Table 2, reliability was moderate to good (Altman, 1991), and inter-annotator agreement was well above chance (25%). Indeed, annotators were in full agreement, or agreed within one rating on the continuum, on over 90% of narratives. This pattern reveals fuzzy category boundaries but sufficient regularity so as to be measurable. This is in line with subjective natural language phenomena, and may be a consequence of imposing discrete categories on a continuum.5 Annotator 1 had better intra-annotator reliability, perhaps due to differences in annotation strategy. 5Nonetheless, affect research has shown that scalar representations are not immune to var</context>

The two middle labels reflect the presence of both styles, with intuitive (BI) or analytical (BA) reasoning being more prominent. Since analytical reasoning involves detailed examination of alternatives, annotators were asked to avoid using length as a proxy for decision style. After the pilot, the annotators jointly discussed disagreements with one researcher. Interannotator reliability, measured by linear weighted kappa (Cohen, 1968), was 0.4 before and 0.8 after resolution; the latter score may be an upper bound on agreement for clinical decision-making annotation. As both annotators reported using physician-provided confidence to judge decision style, in subsequent annotation confidence mentions had been removed if they appeared after the final diagnosis (most narratives), or, if intermixed with diagnostic reasoning, replaced with dashes. Finally, silent pauses3 were coded as ellipses to aid in the human parsing of the narratives. 4 Quantative Annotation Analysis Table 1 shows the annotator rating distributions.4 I BI B</context>

Factors were chosen based on discussion with the annotators after the pilot, and referred to in descriptions of decision styles in the annotator instructions; the descriptions were based on characteristics of each style in the cognitive psychology literature (e.g., Evans, 2008). Factors with high variability (SD columns in Table 3) reveal changes in annotator strategy over time, and factors that may influence intra-annotator reliability. Both annotators reported using the rel. (similarity) offinal &amp; first-mentioned diagnosis, as well as perceived attitude, perceived confidence, and use of justification, to rate most narratives. Types of processing were used by both sometimes; this is important since these are central to the definitions of decision style in decision-making theory.

Thus, it responds to the need for investigating subjective natural language phenomena (Alm, 2011). The annotated corpus is a springboard for decision research in medicine, as well as other mission-critical domains in which good decisions save lives, time, and money. Subjective computational modeling is particularly challenging because often, no real ‘ground truth’ is available. Decision style is such a fuzzy concept, lacking clear boundaries (Hampton, 1998), and its recognition develops in psychologists over time, via exposure to knowledge and practice in cognitive psychology. Interpreting fuzzy decision categories also depends on mental models which lack strong intersubjective agreement. This is the nature, and challenge, of capturing understandings that emerge organically. This work’s contributions include (1) presenting a distinct clinical resource, (2) introducing a robust method for fuzzy clinical annotation tasks, (3) analyzing the annotated data comprehensively, and (4) devising a new metric that links annotated behavior to clinicians’ de</context>

Language use can provide insight into physician decision style, as linguistic content reflects cognitive processes (Pennebaker &amp; King, 1999). While most clinical corpora focus on patients or conditions, physician diagnostic narratives have been successfully annotated for conceptual units (e.g., identifying medical morphology or a differential diagnosis), by Womack et al. (2013) and McCoy et al. (2012). Crowley et al. (2013) created an instructional system to detect cognitive biases in clinical decision-making, while Coderre et al. (2003) used protocol analysis on think-aloud diagnostic narratives, and found that features of intuitive reasoning implied diagnostic accuracy. In this study, speech data were collected from physicians as they diagnosed dermatological cases presented to them as images. Physician verbalizations were annotated for decision style on a fourpoint scale from intuitive to analytical (Figure 1). Importantly, cognitive psychologists were brought in</context>

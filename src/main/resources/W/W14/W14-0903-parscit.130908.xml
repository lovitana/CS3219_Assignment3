Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999979923076923">
This contribution deals with the use of
quotations (repeated n-grams) in the works
of medieval Arabic literature. The analysis
is based on a 420 millions of words histor-
ical corpus of Arabic. Based on repeated
quotations from work to work, a network
is constructed and used for interpretation
of various aspects of Arabic literature.
Two short case studies are presented, con-
centrating on the centrality and relevance
of individual works, and the analysis of a
time depth and resulting impact of a given
work in various periods.

1 Quotations and Their Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998806">
The relevance of individual works in a given liter-
ature and the time depth of such relevance are of
interest for many reasons. There are many meth-
ods that can reveal such relevance.
The current contribution is based on quotation
extraction. Quotations, both covert and overt, both
from written and oral sources, belong to constitu-
tive features of medieval Arabic literature.
There are genres which heavily depend on es-
tablishing credible links among sources, espe-
cially the oral ones, where a trusty chain of
tradents is crucial for the claims that such chains
accompany. Other links may point to the impor-
tance of a given work (or its part) and may un-
cover previously unseen relations within a given
literature or a given genre/register, or reveal con-
nections among genres/registers within a given lit-
erature. As such, the results are interesting in a
wide research range, from linguists or literature
theorists to authors interested in the interactions
of various subsets of a given literature.
The research on quotations, their extraction and
detection is rich in the NLP, but the algorihms used
are based mainly on the quotation-marker recog-
nition, e.g. Pareti et al. (2013), Pouliquen et al.

(2007) and Fernandes et al. (2011), or on the meta-
data procesing (e.g. Shi et al. 2010), to name just a
few examples. It can be said that most of the con-
tributions focus on issues different from the one
described in this contribution and choose a differ-
ent approach.
Our understanding of quotations in this project
is limited to similar strings of words, i.e. the
quotations are very close to borrowings or rep-
etition of verbatim or almost verbatim passages.
Technically, it can be viewed as an n-gram that is
being repeated in at least two works. These re-
peated n-grams create links that exhibit some hier-
archy, e.g. on the chronological line. The only ap-
proach known to us that can be paralleled to ours is
the one described in Kolak and Schilit (2008) for
quotation mining within the Google Books corpus
with algorithm searching for verbatim quotations
only.
In a different context and without direct inspira-
tion we developed an algorithm that is tolerant to
a certain degree of lexical and morphological vari-
ation and word order variability. The reason for
this tolerance is both the type of the Arabic lan-
guage (flective morphology and free word order),
but also the fact that the quotations in medieval
Arabic literature tend not to be very strict. Despite
of the fact that the matching is not so rigorous, we
assume that the length of n-grams we use drasti-
cally decreases possibilities of random matches.
The frequency of such n-gram repetition in var-
ious literary works can point to several aspects,
however, in this contribution we will limit our-
selves to interpreting such links in a rather cau-
tious and not too far-reaching manner, mainly as
pointers to the fact that the writer of the book
where the quotations appear was also a reader of
the book from which the quotations stem and that
he was to a certain degree influenced by it.
This does not necessarily mean that the lineage
of quotations is complete in our picture, for we

Extraction

It is obvious that for the type of the task mentioned
in the previous chapter, there is a need of an appro-
priate data set.

2.1 Historical Corpus of Arabic
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999928888888889">
All the data in this contribution come from a his-
torical corpus of Arabic (CLAUDIA — Corpus
LinguæArabicæUniversalis DIAchronicus). This
corpus covers all the main phases of the Arabic
writings, from the 7th century to mid 20th century
C.E. It contains ca. 2 thousand works and ca. 420
million words. The individual works are present in
their entirety, i.e. each file contains a full text of a
given literary work, based on edited manuscripts.
All the main registers (genres) that appeared in the
history of Arabic literature are represented in the
corpus.
All the texts in the corpus are raw, without ad-
ditional annotation. The files contain only a basic
annotation of parts to be excluded from analyses
(introductions, editorial forewords, etc.). This is
of importance for the algorithms development, as
the ambiguity of a text written down in Arabic let-
ters is rather high (cf. e.g. Beesley 2001, Buck-
walter 2004 or Smrˇz 2007 passim). On the other
hand, it is certainly clear that the ambiguity sig-
nificantly decreases when the n-gram information
(i.e. context) is introduced.
As such, the corpus can be viewed as a network-
like representation of Arabic literature. Each work
is assigned several attributes, such as authorship,
position on the time line, genre characteristics, etc.
As several of the attributes can be viewed from
several angles, it should be made clear that the
genre characteristics currently used correspond to
rather traditional terms used in Arabic and Islamic
studies. Currently, the attributes assigned to the in-
dividual works are based on extra-corpus informa-
tion and all of them were assigned manually from
standard sources.
A short remark on the character of Arabic lit-
erature is appropriate. One should bear in mind
that the approach to literature as consisting only of
belles-lettres is relatively new, and for Arabic lit-
erature can be applied at the soonest at the end of
the 19th century. All the previous phases must be
seen as containing very different genres, includ-
ing science, philosophy, popular reading and po-
etry as well as a huge bulk of writings connected
with Islam, thus representing rather the concept of
“Schrifttum” as expressed in the canonical com-
pendia on Arabic literature, such as Brockelmann
(last edition 1996). This is also reflected in cur-
rent contribution, as many of our examples are
connected with Islamic literature covering all the
aspects of the study of religion. This includes the-
ology, Islamic law, history, evaluation of sources,
tradition, etc. Further information can be found
e.g. in Kuiper 2010.

2.2 The Grid and the Network
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968764705882">
The construction of a grid from a corpus consists
basically in defining some constitutive units that
serve as nodes. There are several possibilities of
constituting such units, but some obvious solu-
tions might not work very well. At first glance, it is
advisable to find as small a unit as possible, while
still retaining its meaningfulness; we decided to
identify such units with individual works, or titles,
with possible further division: Arabic literature is
full of several-volume sets, and as our analyses
showed, it may be sometimes useful to treat them
as multi-part units, where individual parts can be
treated as individual nodes (e.g., in some of our
analyses it appeared that only a second volume of
a three-volume set was significant). Treating such
parts as individual nodes reveals similar cases in-
stantly and can prevent overlooking important fea-
tures during the analysis.
The nodes should allow reasonable links lead-
ing from one node to another. These links are
crucial for any possible interpretation, as they
show various types of relations between individ-
ual nodes. These nodes can be again grouped to-
gether, to show relations among different types of
grouped information (i.e. links between titles or
their parts, among authors, centuries, genres, etc.).
The nodes as such create the basis for the con-
struction of both the grid and the network. As
pointed out, currently the main axes used for
grid and network construction are the authorship,
chronological line, and the register information.
The links among individual nodes are interpreted
as relational links, or edges, in a network. These
links also reflect quantitative data (currently, the
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999945947368421">
number of quotations normalized to the lengths of
the documents). The grid currently consists of the
chronological line and the line of the works (doc-
uments). Above this grid, a network consisting of
edges connecting the works is constructed. The
grid in our approach corresponds to a firm frame
where some basic attributes are used. The net-
work then consists of the relations that go across
the grid and reveal new connections between indi-
vidual units.
A terminological remark is appropriate here.
The network constructed above the grid corre-
sponds to a great deal to what is called a weighted
graph (the width of edges reflects the frequency
of links). The term directed graph could also be
used, however, in our current conception of the
network, the links are not really oriented, as the di-
rection of links pointing to contemporary authors
is sometimes not clearly determinable, contrary to
authors with greater time gap.1 That is why we
call these links edges and not arcs, and possibly,
the graph could be called a semi-directed graph.
Kolak and Schilit (2008) observe that the stan-
dard plagiarism detection algorithms are use-
less for unmarked quotation mining and sug-
gest straightforward and efficient algorithm for re-
peated passage extraction. The algorithm is suit-
able for modern English texts, since quotations are
more or less verbatim and the word order is stable.
But it is insufficient for medieval Arabic texts as
the quotations are usually not really strict and the
word order in Arabic is variable. We decided that
our algorithm must be a) word order insensitive;
b) tolerant to certain degree of variability in the
content of quotations, so that the algorithm allows
some variation introduced by the copyist, and re-
flects possibilities of change due to the fact that
Arabic is a flective language.

2.3 Quotations extraction: technical
description
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.941091157894737">
The basic operation in the process is the quotations
extraction. The procedure itself could be used in
plagiarism detection, however, such labels do not
make sense in case of medieval literature with dif-
ferent scales of values.
The quotation extraction process consists of
four phases:
1Our time reference is based on the date of death of re-
spective authors, and thus can be considered as “raw”. Data
on the publication of a respective book are often not available
for more distant periods.
1. The corpus is prepared for analysis. Numer-
als and junk characters are removed from the
corpus, as well as all other types of noise. Re-
verse index of all word types in the corpus is
constructed (in case of texts written in Ara-
bic script, a special treatment of diacritical
signs and the aliph-grapheme and its variants
is necessary).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96661352">
2. All repeating n-grams greater than 7 tokens
are logged (the algorithm is tolerant to the
word order variability and to the variability
of types up to 10 %) 2 : Tokens of every
n-gram in the text are sorted according to
their frequency in the whole corpus (for ev-
ery n in some reasonable range, in our case
n ∈&lt; 7; 200 &gt;).
(a) The positions of round(0.1n) + 1 least
frequent tokens3 are looked up in the re-
verse index.
(b) The neighbourhoods of the positions are
tested for being quotations of the length
of n tokens.
(c) Quotations are merged so that quota-
tions larger than n tokens are detected
as well.
3. For each pair of texts i, j the following index
Ξ(i,j) is calculated (N is the number of to-
kens in a text, M is the number of tokens that
are part of quotations of the text j in the text i,
K is the set of all pairs of texts in the corpus;
h is the parameter that determines number of
edges visible in the graph, for details see be-
low):
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.951169352941176">
2The minimal length of the quotation and the percentage
of word types variability should have been determined on an
empirical basis, maximizing recall and precision. The prob-
lem is that the decision whether the repeating text passage
is a quotation or not is not a binary one. Kolak and Schilit
(2008) note the problem and let their subjects evaluate results
of their algorithm on a 1–5 scale. As we did not manage to do
vast and proper evaluation of the outputs of our algorithm us-
ing various minimal lengths of the quotations and degrees of
variability, we relied on our subjective experience. The mini-
mal length was set so that it exceeds length of the most com-
mon Arabic phrases and Islamic eulogies and the percentage
of variable words was set to cover some famous examples of
formulaicity in Arabic literature
It needs to be said that some minor changes of the param-
eters do not influence the results excessively, at least for the
case studies we present here.

It should be noted that the formula given
above is inspired by the Mutual Information
but it has no interpretation within the theory
of information. It was constructed only to
transform the number of quoted tokens into
some index that could be graphically repre-
sented in some reasonable way convenient to
the human mind.
4. The edges representing links with ° lower
than a certain threshold are omitted. The
threshold is set to 0.5 according to the limits
of the programs producing graphic represen-
tation of the graph (the width of the line rep-
resenting the edge is associated directly with
the index °). The index is normalized by the
parameter h so that the user can set density
of the graph, i.e. manipulate the index on
an ad hoc basis with consideration for suit-
able number of edges and their ideal average
width. E.g., the number of word tokens in-
volved in autoquotations in Qur’an is 13956
and the overall number of tokens is 80 047.

3 The Analysis and Interpretation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959083333333">
The results are currently stored in a database and
are available for further analyses. It is clear that
results from a corpus of 420 million words offer
many ways of interpretation.
The usage of the extracted data is to a certain de-
gree limited in nature. It is mainly suitable for dis-
cussion of relations among individual nodes (doc-
uments, titles) or their groups. However, further
processing of the data will enable a wider palette
of possibilities. Currently, and also due to the lim-
itations of this paper, only a few examples will be
given.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999544">
3.1 Central Nodes and Relevance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989333333333">
The centrality of a given document may point to
its relevance for its surroundings. If the relations
that were found by our algorithms are interpreted
merely as showing influence of predecessors on
the author and his influence on his successors, then
the number of links to and from an author and his
particular book shows the relevance of that book.
In graph theory, there is no general agreement
on how centrality should be defined. We expand
the large number of indices of the degree centrality
with our own index that is based on the same idea
as the ° index (J is the set of all texts):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8758488">
°i,j = log2
MQur&apos;an,Qur&apos;an 13 956 = 0.00000218 1] Mi,j
NQur&apos;anNQur&apos;an CD(i) = NiNj
j∈J
800472
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999274631578947">
For our corpus, the average value is
0.000025, setting h &lt; 16.23 then means
that the Qur’anic autoquotation link will not
be represented in the graph. Setting h =
0.346574 means that an average link gets
° = 0.5. Setting h = 2 means that an av-
erage link gets ° = 1.
The relation is exported to the .dot format
and the graph is generated by popular appli-
cations GraphViz and GVEdit.4
The resulting database is stored in a binary for-
mat, but the graphical user interface allows the re-
searchers to export graphs in accordance to their
concepts. The features of the graphs can be
changed by manipulating the h parameter and
some other options. The appearance of the nodes
can be freely adjusted as well.
More detailed information on the overall techni-
cal process is available directly from the authors.

straightforward index results in table 1. The table
also contains the plain number of edges at h = 10

As the pointers to the subject of the respective
works show, it was not only Islamic subjects that
found their way to the most cited works in Arabic
literature — historical literature as well as educa-
tive literature obviously played an important role
in the medieval Arabic civilization.

only the second volume of his three-volume Nasab

Ibn Xaldun (d. 1382) is a very well-known fig-
ure today, respected for his History. Today, es-
pecially his Introduction (Muqaddima) is appreci-
ated as an insightful methodological propedeutics.
In Figure 2, his relevance in the Middle Ages is
measured: it comprises 4 volumes: Introduction
and History vols. 1–3. The graph shows (apart
from numerous autoquotations) that his 3rd vol-
ume is the central one, where most of incoming
and outgoing links can be found. On the other
hand, his Muqaddima, which is praised today for
its originality, remains isolated (our data do not
cover the second half of the 20th century, where
this appreciation could be found).

3.2 Time Depth
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988840285714286">
As our network combines a grid with chronolog-
ical axis, it is rather easy to follow the distribu-
tion of links connected to a given node not only
the relevance to other nodes, but also in time. As
relevance of a given work is mostly judged from
our current point of view (i.e. from what is con-
sidered important in the 21st century), an unbiased
analysis may give interesting results showing both
inspirational sources of a given work and its influ-
ence on other authors; it can also show the limits
of such influence.
Figure 1 concentrates on the figure of az-Zayla‘i
(d. 1360), who obviously played an important role
in transmitting the knowledge (or discussion, at
least) between different periods (cf. 3.1). The sec-
ond volume of his Nasab ar-Raya is a clear center
of the network.
The dating of the numerous sources that he used
while writing his book starts ca. from the 10th cen-
tury and to a great deal almost ignores 11th and
12th centuries. There is a thick web of links to
his contemporaries, and his direct influence is very
strong on the authors of the following century, but
slowly wanes with the passage of time — although
there are some attestations of his influence in the
16th and 17th centuries, they are getting less and
less numerous. In the 20th century there are only
two authors at whom we found some reflection of
az-Zayla‘i ’s work.
From the point of view of the 21st century, az-
Zayla‘i is a marginal figure, both for the Western
and Arabic civilizations. On the other hand, as our
data show, his importance was crucial for the dis-
cussion on Islamic themes for several centuries,
which is, apart from the data given above, con-
firmed also by frequent quotations of his name and
writings in the titles starting from the 15th century
on.5
It is appropriate to repeat here that such conclu-
sions can be viewed as mere signals, as we can-
not exclude that there is some title occurring in the
quotations lineage but missing in our data.
It should also be stressed that these conclusions
reflect only verbatim quotations and are not based
on the contents of these works. In other words, the
relations do not represent an immediate reflection
of the spread of ideas of a given author but rather
show the usage of a given work in various periods
of the evolution of Arabic literature.

<abstract confidence="0.9988486">This contribution deals with the use of quotations (repeated n-grams) in the works of medieval Arabic literature. The analysis is based on a 420 millions of words historical corpus of Arabic. Based on repeated quotations from work to work, a network is constructed and used for interpretation of various aspects of Arabic literature. Two short case studies are presented, concentrating on the centrality and relevance of individual works, and the analysis of a time depth and resulting impact of a given work in various periods. 1 Quotations and Their Definition The relevance of individual works in a given literature and the time depth of such relevance are of interest for many reasons. There are many methods that can reveal such relevance. The current contribution is based on quotation extraction. Quotations, both covert and overt, both from written and oral sources, belong to constitutive features of medieval Arabic literature. There are genres which heavily depend on establishing credible links among sources, especially the oral ones, where a trusty chain of tradents is crucial for the claims that such chains accompany. Other links may point to the importance of a given work (or its part) and may uncover previously unseen relations within a given literature or a given genre/register, or reveal connections among genres/registers within a given literature. As such, the results are interesting in a wide research range, from linguists or literature theorists to authors interested in the interactions of various subsets of a given literature. The research on quotations, their extraction and detection is rich in the NLP, but the algorihms used are based mainly on the quotation-marker recognition, e.g. Pareti et al. (2013), Pouliquen et al.</abstract>

It can be said that most of the contributions focus on issues different from the one described in this contribution and choose a different approach. Our understanding of quotations in this project is limited to similar strings of words, i.e. the quotations are very close to borrowings or repetition of verbatim or almost verbatim passages. Technically, it can be viewed as an n-gram that is being repeated in at least two works. These repeated n-grams create links that exhibit some hierarchy, e.g. on the chronological line. The only approach known to us that can be paralleled to ours is the one described in Kolak and Schilit (2008) for quotation mining within the Google Books corpus with algorithm searching for verbatim quotations only. In a different context and without direct inspiration we developed an algorithm that is tolerant to a certain degree of lexical and morphological variation and word order variability. The reason for this tolerance is both the type of the Arabic language (flective morphology and free word order), but also the fact that the quotations in medieval Arabic literature tend not to be very strict. Despite of the fact that the matching is not so rigorous, we assume that the length of n-grams we use drastically decreases possibilities of random matches. The frequency of such n-gram repetition in various literary works can point to several aspects, however, in this contribution we will limit ourselves to interpreting such links in a rather cautious and not too far-reaching manner, mainly as pointers to the fact that the writer of the book where the quotations appear was also a reader of the book from which the quotations stem and that he was to a certain degree influenced by it. This does not necessarily mean that the lineage of quotations is complete in our picture, for we 17 of the 3rd Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Literature (CLfL) @ EACL pages Sweden, April 27, 2014. Association for Computational Linguistics have to admit that there could be some author — member of the lineage — who is not involved in our corpus. In our graph, however, edges point to the first instance of a given n-gram in our data. 2 The Data, Its Organization and Extraction It is obvious that for the type of the task mentioned in the previous chapter, there is a need of an appropriate data set. 2.1 Historical Corpus of Arabic All the data in this contribution come from a historical corpus of Arabic (CLAUDIA — Corpus LinguæArabicæUniversalis DIAchronicus). This corpus covers all the main phases of the Arabic from the century to mid century C.E. It contains ca. 2 thousand works and ca. 420 million words. The individual works are present in their entirety, i.e. each file contains a full text of a given literary work, based on edited manuscripts. All the main registers (genres) that appeared in the history of Arabic literature are represented in the corpus. All the texts in the corpus are raw, without additional annotation. The files contain only a basic</abstract>

This is of importance for the algorithms development, as the ambiguity of a text written down in Arabic letters is rather high (cf. e.g. Beesley 2001, Buckwalter 2004 or Smrˇz 2007 passim). On the other hand, it is certainly clear that the ambiguity significantly decreases when the n-gram information (i.e. context) is introduced. As such, the corpus can be viewed as a networklike representation of Arabic literature. Each work is assigned several attributes, such as authorship, position on the time line, genre characteristics, etc. As several of the attributes can be viewed from several angles, it should be made clear that the genre characteristics currently used correspond to rather traditional terms used in Arabic and Islamic studies.

The network constructed above the grid corresponds to a great deal to what is called a weighted graph (the width of edges reflects the frequency of links). The term directed graph could also be used, however, in our current conception of the network, the links are not really oriented, as the direction of links pointing to contemporary authors is sometimes not clearly determinable, contrary to authors with greater time gap.1 That is why we call these links edges and not arcs, and possibly, the graph could be called a semi-directed graph. Kolak and Schilit (2008) observe that the standard plagiarism detection algorithms are useless for unmarked quotation mining and suggest straightforward and efficient algorithm for repeated passage extraction. The algorithm is suitable for modern English texts, since quotations are more or less verbatim and the word order is stable. But it is insufficient for medieval Arabic texts as the quotations are usually not really strict and the word order in Arabic is variable. We decided that our algorithm must be a) word order insensitive; b) tolerant to certain degree of variability in the content of quotations, so that th</context>

The problem is that the decision whether the repeating text passage is a quotation or not is not a binary one. Kolak and Schilit (2008) note the problem and let their subjects evaluate results of their algorithm on a 1–5 scale. As we did not manage to do vast and proper evaluation of the outputs of our algorithm using various minimal lengths of the quotations and degrees of variability, we relied on our subjective experience. The minimal length was set so that it exceeds length of the most common Arabic phrases and Islamic eulogies and the percentage of variable words was set to cover some famous examples of formulaicity in Arabic literature It needs to be said that some minor changes of the parameters do not influence the re</context>

This is also reflected in current contribution, as many of our examples are connected with Islamic literature covering all the aspects of the study of religion. This includes theology, Islamic law, history, evaluation of sources, tradition, etc. Further information can be found e.g. in Kuiper 2010. 2.2 The Grid and the Network The construction of a grid from a corpus consists basically in defining some constitutive units that serve as nodes. There are several possibilities of constituting such units, but some obvious solutions might not work very well. At first glance, it is advisable to find as small a unit as possible, while still retaining its meaningfulness; we decided to identify such units with individual works, or titles, with possible further division: Arabic literature is full of several-volume sets, and as our analyses showed, it may be sometimes useful to treat them as multi</context>

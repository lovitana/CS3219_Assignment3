NLP tools are typically trained on written data from native speakers. However, research into
language acquisition and tools for language teaching &amp; proficiency assessment would benefit
from accurate processing of spoken data from second language learners. In this paper we dis-
cuss manual annotation schemes for various features of spoken language; we also evaluate the
automatic tagging of one particular feature (filled pauses) – finding a success rate of 81%; and we
evaluate the effect of using our manual annotations to ‘clean up’ the transcriptions for sentence
parsing, resulting in a 25% improvement in parse success rate by completely cleaning the texts of
disfluencies and errors. We discuss the need to adapt existing NLP technology to non-canonical

Natural language processing (NLP) tools are typically trained on written data from native speakers.
However, research into language acquisition and tools for language proficiency assessment &amp; language
teaching – such as learner dialogue and feedback systems – would benefit from accurate processing of
spoken data from second language learners. Being able to convert the text from unparseable to parseable
form will enable us to (a) posit a target hypothesis that the learner intended to produce, and (b) provide
feedback on this target based on the information removed or repaired in achieving that parseable form.
To proceed towards this goal, we need to adapt current NLP tools to the non-canonical domain of
spoken learner language in a persistent fashion rather than use ad hoc post-processing steps to ‘correct’
the non-canonical data. Outcomes of this approach have been reported in the literature (e.g. Rimell &amp;
Clark (2009) in the biomedical domain; Caines &amp; Buttery (2010) for spoken language). These fully
adaptive approaches require large amounts of annotated data to be successful and, as we intend to work
along these lines in future, the discussion in this paper is pointed in that direction.
The work presented here will act as a foundation for more permanent adaptations to existing tools.
We annotate transcriptions of speech for linguistic features that are known to interfere with standard
NLP to assess whether large-scale annotation of these features will be useful for training purposes. Ob-
vious instances of this include disfluencies (e.g. filled pauses, false starts, repetition), formal errors of
morphology and syntax, as well as ‘errors’ of word and phrase selection1.
Since manual annotation is costly in terms of time and often money, one might question whether so
many feature types are strictly necessary or even helpful for the task in hand. Indeed, filled pauses
such as ‘oh’ and ‘um’ are already accounted for in the part-of-speech (POS) tagset we use (CLAWS2
(Garside, 1987)); and one might also argue that lexico-semantic errors might be dismissed a priori on
the assumption that both the original and proposed forms are of the same POS (and thus won’t affect
a parser that performs tagging before the parse). We investigate the contribution of these features to

parsing success. From a theoretical perspective we are interested in these features with regard to second
language acquisition and therefore need to analyse them closely.
In this paper we describe our initial efforts to address the challenge of parsing learner speech with
tools trained on native speaker writing. We also present empirical results that demonstrate the utility of
annotated spoken transcription with respect to both tagging and parsing. We investigate: [i] the frequency
of disfluencies, formal errors of morpho-syntax, and idiomatic errors of lexico-semantics in a corpus of
spoken learner language; [ii] the accuracy of part-of-speech labels produced by the tagger associated
with the Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing System (RASP (Briscoe et al., 2006)) for a particular type
of disfluency (the filled pause)2; [iii] parse success rates and parse likelihoods using the RASP System
with the texts in various ‘modes’ ranging from unaltered transcription to fully edited and corrected3.
We find that in our spoken learner corpus of 2262 words, (i) around a quarter of words are annotated
as disfluencies or errors; (ii) 81% of filled pauses were correctly tagged, meaning 1 in 5 are incorrectly
tagged; (iii) mean parse likelihood for the text ‘as is’, unaltered, is –2.599 with a parse success rate of
47%, whereas completely ‘cleaned up’ text improves those scores to –1.995 and 72%4. We discuss the
implications of these results below, along with the background context for our study and a more detailed
description of our investigations.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999632">
Previous analyses of the NLP of learner language include various experiments on the tagging and parsing
of errorful text. Geertzen et al. (2013) employed the Stanford parser on written English learner data and
achieved labelled and unlabelled attachment scores (LAS, UAS)5 of 89.6% and 92.1%. They found that
errors at the morphological level lead to incorrect POS-tagging, which in turn can result in an erroneous
parse. Others have focused only on the POS-tagging of written learner corpora – for example with
English (van Rooy and Schäfer, 2003) and French learner data (Thouësny, 2011) – demonstrating that
post-hoc corrections for the most frequent tagging errors results in significant parse error reduction.
In other investigations of standard NLP tools on learner corpora, Ott &amp; Ziai (2010) report general
robustness using MaltParser on written German learner language; however, they found that by manually
correcting POS tags, LAS improved from 79.15% to 85.71% and UAS from 84.81% to 90.22%. Wagner
&amp; Foster (2009) ran a series of parsing experiments using parallel errorful/corrected corpora, including
a spoken learner corpus in which the likelihood of the highest ranked tree for corrected sentences was
higher than that of uncorrected sentences in 69.6% of 500 instances. Taken together, these studies suggest
that existing NLP tools remain robust to learner data, even more so if the original texts can be corrected
and if the tagging stage is in some way verified, or adapted (e.g. Zinsmeister et al. (2014)).
On the other hand, Díaz-Negrillo et al. (2010) argue that treating learner data as a ‘noisy variant’ of
native language glosses over systematic differences between the two, and instead call for a dedicated tag-
ging format for ‘interlanguage’, one that encodes distributional, morphological and lexical information.
For instance, ‘walks’ in ‘John has walks’ would morphologically be tagged as a present tense 3rd-person
verb, but distributionally tagged as a past participle6. This is the kind of adaptation of existing tools that
we advocate, though we would add that this system should be available for not just interlanguage but all
data, allowing for non-canonical language use by native speakers as much as learners.
As for spoken language, Caines &amp; Buttery (2010) among others suggest that adaptation can also be
made to the parser, such that it enters a ‘speech-aware mode’ in which the parser refers to additional
and/or replacement rules adapted to the particular features of spoken language. They demonstrated this
with the omission of auxiliary verbs in progressive aspect sentences (‘you talking to me?’, ’how you

the PARC dependency bank (DepBank; (King et al., 2003)) and achieved 97% accuracy (Briscoe et al., 2006).
3The RASP parser achieves a 79.7% microaveraged F1 score on grammatical relations in DepBank (Briscoe and Carroll,
2006).

3 The corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978">
Our speech data consist of recordings from Business Language Testing Service (BULATS) speaking
tests7. In the test, learners are required to undertake five tasks; we exclude the tasks involving brief
question-answering (‘can you tell me your full name?’, ‘where are you from?’, etc) and elicited imitation,
leaving us with three free-form speech tasks. For this particular test the tasks were: [a] talk about some
advice from a colleague (monologue), [b] talk about a series of charts from Business Today magazine
(monologue), [c] give advice on starting a new retail business (dialogue with examiner).
In our full dataset the candidates come from India, Pakistan and Brazil, with various first languages
(L1) including Hindi, Gujarati, Malayalam, Urdu, Pashto and Portuguese, and an age range of 16 to 47
at the time of taking the test. However, in this analysis we have only sampled recordings from candidates
deemed to be at ‘B2’ upper intermediate level on the CEFR scale8, so that the proficiency level of
language used (and how that relates to NLP) is controlled for. In addition the L1s in our sample are
Gujarati, Punjabi and Urdu only. This gives us a sample corpus of 2262 tokens in ‘as-is’ format (i.e. the
true transcriptions before any corrections are made).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99895">
The recordings were manually transcribed and annotated for various features falling into three categories
described and exemplified in the following non-exhaustive list.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.856689588235294">
• disfluencies – interruptions to the flow of otherwise fluent speech;
– &lt;fp&gt; filled pauses (tokens such as uh, er, um that serve to fill time and hold the turn) and &lt;rep
n=&amp;quot;n&amp;quot;&gt; repetition (the speaker repeats a word or phrase one or several times):
“or the other way is to &lt;fp&gt;um&lt;/fp&gt; &lt;rep n=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&gt;is to&lt;/rep&gt; raise finance”
– &lt;false&gt; false starts – the speaker begins to express a word or phrase which he then corrects:
“in two thousand eight it was &lt;false&gt;thirty five p&lt;/false&gt; thirty percent”
• formal errors of morpho-syntax, such as number agreement, verb inflection and word order errors;
– noun form: “for becoming a chartered &lt;NS type=&amp;quot;FN&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;accountants&lt;/i&gt;&lt;c&gt;accountant
&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/NS&gt;”
– missing verb: “as the charts &lt;NS type=&amp;quot;MV&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;c&gt;show&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/NS&gt; its sales increased”
– word order: “&lt;NS type=&amp;quot;W&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;how it would be help for you mention&lt;/i&gt;&lt;c&gt;mention how
it helped you&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/NS&gt;”
• idiomatic ‘errors’ – infelicities in lexical selection, failure to express intended meaning, or less-
than-natural phrasing;
– idiomatic: “all my class &lt;NS type=&amp;quot;ID&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;fellows&lt;/i&gt;&lt;c&gt;mates&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/NS&gt;”
– idiomatic: “to &lt;NS type=&amp;quot;ID&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;get in&lt;/i&gt;&lt;c&gt;make a&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/NS&gt; profit”
– replace quantifier: “for a bank to grant us &lt;NS type=&amp;quot;RQ&amp;quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt;&lt;c&gt;a&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/NS&gt; loan”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959111111111">
The annotation scheme for formal and idiomatic errors comes from the project to annotate the Cambridge
Learner Corpus (Briscoe et al., 2010). The ‘error zone’ is denoted by &lt;NS&gt; tags, with any original
token(s) enclosed by &lt;i&gt; and any proposed correction enclosed by &lt;c&gt;. The various error types are
defined in Nicholls (2003) and the categories are similar to the ones given: either self-defining (‘ID’ for
idiom error, ‘W’ for word order, etc) or a combination of operation plus part-of-speech (‘FN’ form of
noun, ‘MV’ missing verb, ‘RQ’ replace quantifier, etc).
In Table 1 we report the number of errors and disfluencies found in our corpus along with a relative
frequency per 100 words. Just under a quarter of the thousand tokens in our corpus are affected by
disfluencies and errors, with the former being far more prevalent.

All transcription and annotation has been carried out by a single annotator (the first author). It would
be interesting to obtain measures of inter-annotator agreement to assess the extent to which the nature of
error judgement (particularly in judgements as to idiomaticity) is subjective.

Since filled pauses such as ‘er’ and ‘um’ are included in the CLAWS2 tagset used by the RASP System
as UH, ‘interjection’, one might question the worth of manually annotating filled pauses (FPs). Of the
disfluency set, it might be one small time-saving to leave these to the tagger. However, ‘interjection’ is
not a homogeneous set, as UH also covers exclamations of surprise (‘oh’) and assent (‘yes’). Moreover,
we find that the POS-tagging of tokens annotated as FPs is not entirely appropriate in this non-canonical
domain. Table 2 shows that the majority of FPs are correctly tagged UH, though others are tagged as
nouns (NN), verbs (VV), adjectives (JJ), adverbs (RR) and foreign words (&amp;FW)9.

One possible solution is to append a dictionary of known FP tokens to the tagger, and specify that
they should be tagged UH, or even better, a new tag such as FP. But as the Table demonstrates, there
are standard, highly frequent FPs such as ‘er’, ‘uh’ and ‘um’, and then there are novel forms such as
‘nuh’, ‘buh’ and ‘nna’ which we found to be rather idiosyncratic – i.e. there might be novel FPs for every
individual. Moreover, the introduction of a closed class depends on consistent transcription practice, not
necessarily a given with even a lone annotator, let alone more than one.
Automatic identification and repair of disfluencies is a well-developed research topic, with continuing
refinements to joint parsing and disfluency detection models (e.g. Qian &amp; Liu (2013), Rasooli &amp; Tetreault
(2014), Honnibal &amp; Johnson (2014)), plus applied work in the domains of automatic speech recognition
(Fitzgerald et al., 2009) and machine translation (Cho et al., 2014). We note the linguistic rules included
in the Lease, Johnson &amp; Charniak (2006) tree adjoining grammar (TAG) noisy-channel model – lexical,
POS and syntactic rules that reduce errors in the TAG model. This is another case of improvements to
NLP tools thanks to data-driven linguistic insight, and a design that we could incorporate into our work
on automated assessment and feedback.

We investigated the effect on the parsing output of each transcription format compared to the (A) format

(C) and (D) in every possible order. The results are set out in Table 3, with mean likelihoods of the
highest ranked parse for each sentence (µ)10, differences between this mean and the baseline where
applicable (Δbase), and success rates in terms of non-fragmentary tree outputs (i.e. parses labelled other

As can be seen in Table 3, the removal of disfluencies (B) is the single move of greatest benefit to
parse likelihood scores and parse tree success rates compared to the ‘as-is’ baseline (A). The correction
of morpho-syntactic (C) and idiomatic errors (D) have a lesser effect. All pairings have a positive effect
on parse likelihoods, especially those featuring disfluency removal (B); and the three ‘corrective’ steps
combined (BCD) have the greatest effect of all.
However, we show by analysis of two candidates in our corpus that these effects can differ on an
individual basis. In Figure 1, the candidate on the left has a less pronounced effect of disfluency removal
(B) compared to the baseline (A) than the candidate on the right. The effect of both formal (C) and
idiomatic (D) error correction are also seen to make improvements over (A), which is not the case for
the second candidate. Such observations serve as a reminder that when generalising about overall corpus
patterns we collapse over so many individual language models. It may well turn out that disfluencies are
an especially idiosyncratic type of language use, an avenue we will explore in future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.986588090909091">
In this paper we have investigated NLP of transcribed learner speech, questioning how tools trained on
native speaker written data would handle such data. We found that the majority (81%) of filled pauses
were correctly tagged ‘UH’, though this only covers three of eleven FP forms (er, um, eh). We propose a
dictionary of FPs and a specific FP POS-tag, while suggesting that the dictionary will not catch all novel
FPs (since they seem to be idiosyncratic) and that we can turn to state-of-the-art research on automated
disfluency detection to help us.
We also showed that sentence parsing could be improved from a 47% ‘success’ rate (i.e. non-
fragmentary (T/frag in RASP parlance) parse trees) in the ‘as-is’ transcriptions, to 72% in transcrip-
tions with disfluencies removed and errors corrected (see Table 3). We found that disfluency removal
is the main contributor to this improvement, though this was found to be somewhat idiosyncratic (as in
Figure 1).

The motivation for this work is to investigate what is required to convert texts from unparseable to
parseable form. The steps taken to achieve this can be used to inform automated learner dialogue or
feedback systems. We note that automated assessment may be improved by parse trees but may well
be performed without them: it can proceed on the basis of superficial detection of features known to
correlate with high grades (possibly including certain disfluency types, for instance). But to be able to
diagnose how the learner can improve, we need a deeper structural analysis of the text – i.e. requiring
that the text is in parseable form. Our manual annotations are one step towards this goal.
Our annotations also indicate that spoken learner data features many disfluencies and errors, with over
a quarter of the 2262-word testset affected in some way. Automatic error detection (and correction) is
a burgeoning field (see for example the work on learner data by Briscoe et al. (2010), Andersen (2011)
and Kochmar &amp; Briscoe (2014), as well as the most recent shared task on grammatical error correction
at CoNLL-2014 (Ng et al., 2014)). Such studies are based on written language. We envisage adding
speech-specific information and adaptations to such systems on the basis of our fuller annotation project.
Indeed, it so happens that the problem of NLP in the spoken domain is one we address here with
learner data. However, we do not assume that the problem of adapting or building NLP tools for spoken
data is substantially different for native speaker data. We intend to collect recordings of native speakers
undertaking the same tasks as the BULATS candidates, allowing for comparative studies of errors and
disfluencies in native and learner data, with the task and topic variables held constant as far as possible.
Finally, we emphasise that we intend to add to the corpus with more annotated data from a wider
range of L1s and a wider range of proficiency levels. We can then investigate the possible effects of more
varied syntactic complexity, lexical diversity and error types.

To proceed towards this goal, we need to adapt current NLP tools to the non-canonical domain of spoken learner language in a persistent fashion rather than use ad hoc post-processing steps to ‘correct’ the non-canonical data. Outcomes of this approach have been reported in the literature (e.g. Rimell &amp; Clark (2009) in the biomedical domain; Caines &amp; Buttery (2010) for spoken language). These fully adaptive approaches require large amounts of annotated data to be successful and, as we intend to work along these lines in future, the discussion in this paper is pointed in that direction. The work presented here will act as a foundation for more permanent adaptations to existing tools. We annotate transcriptions of speech for linguistic features that are known to interfere with standard NLP to assess whether large-scale annotation of these features will be useful for training purposes.

Obvious instances of this include disfluencies (e.g. filled pauses, false starts, repetition), formal errors of morphology and syntax, as well as ‘errors’ of word and phrase selection1. Since manual annotation is costly in terms of time and often money, one might question whether so many feature types are strictly necessary or even helpful for the task in hand. Indeed, filled pauses such as ‘oh’ and ‘um’ are already accounted for in the part-of-speech (POS) tagset we use (CLAWS2 (Garside, 1987)); and one might also argue that lexico-semantic errors might be dismissed a priori on the assumption that both the original and proposed forms are of the same POS (and thus won’t affect a parser that performs tagging before the parse).

Others have focused only on the POS-tagging of written learner corpora – for example with English (van Rooy and Schäfer, 2003) and French learner data (Thouësny, 2011) – demonstrating that post-hoc corrections for the most frequent tagging errors results in significant parse error reduction.

Being able to convert the text from unparseable to parseable form will enable us to (a) posit a target hypothesis that the learner intended to produce, and (b) provide feedback on this target based on the information removed or repaired in achieving that parseable form. To proceed towards this goal, we need to adapt current NLP tools to the non-canonical domain of spoken learner language in a persistent fashion rather than use ad hoc post-processing steps to ‘correct’ the non-canonical data. Outcomes of this approach have been reported in the literature (e.g. Rimell &amp; Clark (2009) in the biomedical domain; Caines &amp; Buttery (2010) for spoken language). These fully adaptive approaches require large amounts of annotated data to be successful and, as we intend to work along these lines in future, the discussion in this paper is pointed in that direction. The work presented here will act as a foundation for more permanent adaptations to existing tools. We annotate transcriptions of speech for linguistic features that are known to interfere with standard NLP to assess whether large-scale annotation of these features will be useful for training purposes.

<bodyText confidence="0.999957133333333">
While there has been lots of interest in
code-switching in informal text such as
tweets and online content, we ask whether
code-switching occurs in the proceedings
of multilingual institutions. We focus on
the Canadian Hansard, and automatically
detect mixed language segments based on
simple corpus-based rules and an existing
word-level language tagger.
Manual evaluation shows that the perfor-
mance of automatic detection varies sig-
nificantly depending on the primary lan-
guage. While 95% precision can be
achieved when the original language is
French, common words generate many
false positives which hurt precision in En-
glish. Furthermore, we found that code-
switching does occur within the mixed
languages examples detected in the Cana-
dian Hansard, and it might be used differ-
ently by French and English speakers.
This analysis suggests that parallel cor-
pora such as the Hansard can provide in-
teresting test beds for studying multilin-
gual practices, including code-switching
and its translation, and encourages us
to collect more gold annotations to im-
prove the characterization and detection
of mixed language and code-switching in
parallel corpora.

What can we learn from language choice pat-
terns observed within multilingual organizations?
While this question has been addressed, for in-
stance, by conducting fieldwork in European
Union institutions (Wodak et al., 2012), we aim
to use natural language processing tools to study
language choice directly from text, leveraging the
publicly available proceedings of multilingual in-
stitutions, which are already widely used for ma-
chine translation. Early work on statistical ap-
proaches to machine translation (Brown et al.,
1990) was made possible by the availability of the
bilingual Canadian Hansard in electronic form1.
Today, translated texts from the Hong Kong Leg-
islative Council, the United Nations, the European
Union are routinely used to build machine transla-
tion systems for many languages in addition to En-
glish and French (Wu, 1994; Koehn, 2005; Eisele
and Chen, 2010, inter alia), and to port linguis-
tic annotation from resource-rich to resource-poor
languages (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Das and Petrov,
2011, among many others).
As a first step, we focus on detecting code-
switching between English and French in the
Canadian Hansard corpus, drawn from the pro-
ceedings of the Canadian House of Commons.
Code-switching occurs when a speaker alternates
between the two languages in the context of a sin-
gle conversation. Since interactions at the House
of Commons are public and formal, we suspect
that code-switching does not occur as frequently
in the Hansard corpus as in other recently stud-
ied datasets. For instance, Solorio and Liu (2008)
used transcriptions of spoken language conversa-
tion, while others focused on informal written gen-
res, such as microblogs and other types of on-
line content (Elfardy et al., 2013; Cotterell et al.,
2014). At the same time, the House of Commons
is a “bilingual operation where French-speaking
and English-speaking staff work together at every
level” (Hicks, 2007), so it is not unreasonable to
assume that code-switching should occur. In ad-
dition, according to the “Canadian Candidate Sur-
vey”, in 2004, the percentage of candidates for the
House of Commons who considered themselves
bilingual ranged from 34% in the Conservative

party to 86% in the Bloc Qu´ebecois. The study
also shows that candidates have a wide range of at-
titudes towards bilingualism and the importance of
language to their sense of identity (Hicks, 2007).
This suggests that code-switching, and more gen-
erally language choice, might reveal an interesting
range of multilingual practices in the Hansard.
In this paper, we adopt a straightforward strat-
egy to detect mixed language in the Canadian
Hansard, using (1) constraints based on the par-
allel nature of the corpus and (2) a state-of-the-
art language detection technique (King and Ab-
ney, 2013). Based on this automatic annotation,
we conduct a detailed analysis of results to address
the following questions:

<listItem confidence="0.99568975">
• How hard is it to detect mixed language in the
Canadian Hansard? What are the challenges
raised by the Hansard domain for state-of-
the-art models?
• Within these mixed language occurrences,
does code-switching occur? What kind of
patterns emerge from the code-switched text
collected?

After introducing the Canadian Hansard corpus
(Section 2), we describe our strategy for automat-
ically detecting mixed language use (Section 3).
We will see that it is a challenging task: preci-
sion varies varies significantly depending on the
primary language, and recall is much lower than
precision for both languages. Finally, we will fo-
cus on the patterns of mixed language use (Sec-
tion 4): they suggest that code-switching does oc-
cur within the mixed language examples detected
in the Canadian Hansard, and that it might be used
differently by French and English speakers.

2 The Canadian Hansard Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994421">
According to Canada’s Constitution, “either the
English or French language may be used by any
person in the debates of the Houses of the Parlia-
ment.”2 As a result, speaker interventions can be
in French or English, and a single speaker can in
principle switch between the two languages.
Our corpus consists of manual transcriptions
and translations of meetings of Canada’s House of
Commons and its committees from 2001 to 2009.
Discussions cover a wide variety of topics, and

<bodyText confidence="0.999962444444444">
speaking styles range from prepared speeches by
a single speaker to more interactive discussions.
The part of the corpus drawn from meetings of the
House of Commons, is often also called Hansard,
while committees refers to the transcriptions of
committee meetings.
This corpus is well-suited to the study of mul-
tilingual interactions and their translation for two
main reasons. First, the transcriptions are anno-
tated with the original language for each inter-
vention. Second, the translations are high qual-
ity direct translations between French and English.
In contrast, a French-English sentence pair in the
European Parliament corpus (Koehn, 2005) could
have been generated from an original sentence in
German that was translated into English, and then
in turn from English into French. Direct transla-
tion eliminates the propagation of “translationese”
effects (Volansky et al., 2013), and avoids losing
track of code-switching examples by translation
into a second or third language.
One potential drawback of working with tran-
scribed text is that the transcription process might
remove pauses, repetitions and other disfluencies.
However, it is unclear whether this affects mixed
language utterances differently than single lan-
guage ones.

2.1 Corpus Structure and Processing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963">
The raw corpus consists of one file per meeting.
The file starts with a header containing meta infor-
mation about the meeting (event name, type, time
and date, etc.), followed by a sequence of “frag-
ments”. Each “fragment” corresponds to a short
segment of transcribed speech by a single speaker,
usually several paragraphs. Fragments are the unit
of text that translators work on, so the original lan-
guage of the fragment is tagged in the corpus, as
it determines whether the content should be trans-
lated into French or into English. We use the orig-
inal language tagged as a gold label to define the
primary language of the speaker in our study of
code-switching.
The raw data was processed using the standard
procedure for machine translation data. Process-
ing steps included sentence segmentation and sen-
tence alignment within each fragment, as well as
tokenization of French and English. This process
yields a total of 8,194,055 parallel sentences. We
exclude subsets reserved for the evaluation of ma-
chine translation systems, and work with the re-

2.2 Corpus-level Language Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999328">
English is used more frequently than French: it
accounts for 80% of segments, as can be seen in
Table 1. The French to English ratio is signifi-
cantly higher in the Hansard than in the Commit-
tees section of the corpus. But how often are both
languages used in a single meeting? We use the
“DocumentTitle” tags marked in the metadata in
order to segment our corpus into meetings. Both
French and English segments are found in the re-
sulting 4740 meetings in the committees subcor-
pus and 927 meetings in the Hansard subcorpus.
How many speakers are bilingual? Table 2 de-
scribes language use per speaker per subcorpus.
Here, we define a speaker as bilingual if their
name is associated with both French and English
fragments. Note that this method might overesti-
mate the number of biilingual speakers, as it does
not allow us to distinguish between two different
individuals with the same name. Overall 22% of
speakers are bilingual. The percentage of bilingual
speakers in the Hansard (56%) is more than twice
that in the Committees (26.5%), reflecting the fact
that Hansard speakers are primarily Members of
Parliament and Ministers, while speakers that ad-
dress the Committees represent a much wider sam-
ple of Canadian society.

3.1 Task Definition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975043478261">
We aim to detect code-switching between English
and French only. While we found anecdotal ev-
idence of other languages such as Spanish and
Italian in the corpus4, these occurrences seem ex-
tremely rare and detecting them is beyond the
scope of this study.
We define mixed-language segments as seg-
ments which contain words in the language other
than their “original language”. Recall that the
original language is the manually assigned lan-
guage of the fragment which the segment is part
of (Section 2). We want to automatically (1) de-
tect mixed-language segments, and (2) label the
French and English words that compose them, in
order to enable further processing. These two
goals can be accomplished simultaneously by a
word-level language tagger.
In a second stage, the automatically detected
mixed language segments are used to manually
study code-switching, since our mixed language
tagger does not yet distinguish between code-
switching and other types of mixed language (e.g.,
borrowings).

3.2 Challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986031739130435">
When the identity of the languages mixed is
known, the state-of-the-art approach to word-level
language identification is the weakly supervised
approach proposed by King and Abney (2013).
They frame the task as a sequence labeling prob-
lem with monolingual text samples for train-
ing data. A Conditional Random Field (CRF)
trained with generalized expectation criteria per-
forms best, when evaluated on a corpus compris-
ing 30 languages, including many low resources
languages such as Azerbaijani or Ojibwa.
In our case, there are only two high-resource
languages involved, which could make the lan-
guage detection task easier. However, the Hansard
domain also presents many challenges: English
and French are closely related languages and share
many words; the Hansard corpus contains many
occurrences of proper names from various origins
which can confuse the language detector; the cor-
pus is very large and unbalanced as we expect the
vast majority of segments to be monolingual.

mille”
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996164">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999354">
To address these challenges, we settled on a two
pass approach: (1) select sentences that are likely
to contain mixed language, and (2) apply CRF-
based word-level language tagging to the selected
sentences.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997102">
3.3 Method: Candidate Sentence Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998699">
We select candidates for mixed language tagging
using two complementary sources of information:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977686153846154">
• frequent words in each language: a mixed-
language segment is likely to contain words
that are known to be frequent in the second
language. For instance, if a segment pro-
duced by a French speaker contains the string
“of”, which is frequent in English, then it is
likely to be a mixed language utterance.
• parallel nature of corpus: if a French speaker
uses English in a predominantly French seg-
ment, the English words used are likely to be
found verbatim in the English translation. As
a result, overlap5 between a segment and its
translation can signal mixed language.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9702085">
We devise a straightforward strategy for selecting
segments for word-level language tagging:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999337416666667">
1. identify the top 1000 most frequent words on
each side of the parallel Hansard corpus.
2. exclude words that occur both in the French
and English list (e.g., the string “on” can be
both an English preposition and a French pro-
noun)
3. select originally French sentences where (a)
at least one word from the English list occurs,
and (b) at least two words from the French
sentence overlap with the English translation
4. select originally English sentences in the
same manner.

The selected segments are then tagged using the
CRF-based model proposed by King and Abney
(2013). It requires samples of a few thousand
words of French and English for training. How
can we select samples of English and French that
are strictly monolingual?
We solve this problem by leveraging the parallel
nature of our corpus again: We assume that a seg-
ment is strictly monolingual if there is no overlap

sample of 1000 monolingual French segments and
1000 monolingual English segments. This yields
about 21k/4k word tokens/types for English, and
24k/4.6k for French. Using these samples, we ap-
ply the CRF approach on each candidate sentence
selected during the previous step. For the low re-
source languages used by King and Abney (2013),
the training samples were much smaller (in the
order of hundreds of words per language), and
learning curves suggest that the accuracy reaches
a plateau very quickly. However, we decide to
use larger samples since they are very easy to con-
struct in our large data setting.

At this stage, we do not have any gold annotation
for code-switching or word-level language identi-
fication on the Hansard corpus. We therefore ask
a bilingual human annotator to evaluate the preci-
sion of the approach for detecting mixed language
segments on a small sample of 100 segments for
each original language. The annotator tagged each
example with the following information: (1) does
the segment actually contain mixed language? (2)
are the language boundaries correctly detected?
(3) what does the second language express? (e.g.,
organization name, idiomatic expression, quote,
etc. The annotator was not given predefined cat-
egories) . Table 3 provides annotation examples.

Based on this gold standard, we can first eval-
uate the performance of the segment-level mixed
language detector (Task (1) as defined in Sec-
tion 3.1). Confusion matrices for English and
French sentences are given in Tables 5 and 4 re-
spectively. The gold label counts confirm that the
classes are very unbalanced, as expected.
The comparison of the predictions with the gold
labels yields quite different results for the two lan-
guages. On English sentences, the mixed language
tagger achieves a high precision (95.4%) at a rea-
sonable level of recall (72.4%) , which is encour-
aging. However, on French sentences, the mixed
language tagger achieves a slightly lower preci-
sion (75%) with an extremely low recall (18.75%).
These scores are computed based on a very small
number of positive predictions by the tagger (4
only) on the sample of 100+ sentences. Never-
theless, these results suggest that, while we might
miss positive examples due to the low recall, the
precision of the mixed language detector is suffi-
ciently high to warrant a more detailed study of the
examples of mixed language detected.

4 Patterns of Mixed Language Use
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919411764706">
Discovering patterns of mixed language use, in-
cluding code-switching, requires a large sample of
mixed language segments. Since the gold standard
constructed for the above evaluation (Section 3)
only provides few positive examples, we ask the
human annotator to apply the annotation proce-
dure illustrated in Table 3 to a sample of posi-
tive predictions: French segments where the tag-
ger found English words, and vice versa.
The number of positive examples detected can
be found in Table 6. Only a small percentage of the
original corpus is tagged as positive, but given that
our corpus is quite large, we already have more
than 10,000 examples to learn from.
The human annotator annotated a random sam-
ple of 60+ examples for each original language

<bodyText confidence="0.999262933333333">
scores, both for mixed language detection at the
segment level, and for accurately tagging words
with French and English, are given in Table 7.
For segment level detection, the precision is much
higher on French than on English, as observed
previously. On English data, the annotation re-
veals that most false positives are due to fre-
quent words that occur both in languages (e.g.,
“province”,“Premier”,“plus”), and are incorrectly
tagged as French in our English segment. The
boundaries of French and English segments are
correctly detected for up to 75% of French seg-
ments, but only for 44% at best in English seg-
ments. More work is therefore needed to accu-
rately tag languages at the word-level. Some of
the second language words are usually detected,
but the boundaries are often wrong, especially at
code-switching points.
In addition to correctness, the annotator was
asked to identify the kind of information conveyed
by the second language, and they came up with
categories that reflected the patterns that emerged
from the examples. Examples of these categories
are given for each language in Table 8, and the
percentage of examples observed per category for
each language are plotted in Figure 1.
While many correctly detected mixed language
segments are due to borrowings, use of organiza-
tion names or titles in the other language, we do
find examples of code switching such as:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999928333333333">
• quotes
• multiword expressions or idioms,
• politeness formulas and formality.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938763157895">
The distribution of code-switching across these
categories is very different for French and En-
glish as original languages. Multiword expres-
sions and idioms account for more than 40% of
English use in French segments, while there are no
examples of French idioms in English segments.
Conversely, while politeness formulas in French
account for more than 30% of correctly detected
mixed language use in English segments, there are
only fewer than 5% such instances in French. This
might suggest that French speakers who code-
switch are more proficient in English than En-
glish speakers in French, or that code-switching is
used for different purposes by English and French
speakers in the Hansard context.
While more analysis is definitely needed to bet-
ter understand code-switching patterns and their
use, we have established that code-switching oc-
curs in the Hansard corpus, and that it might be
used differently by French and English speakers.
In the parallel corpus, different types of mixed
language are handled differently by human trans-
lators, which suggests that machine translation
of code-switched data requires specific strategies:
while English idioms, quotes or named entities in
a French segment might be directly copied to the
output when translating into English, other cat-
egories should be handled diffferently. For in-
stance, mixed language that discusses translation
of terms might require to avoid translating the
original French terms in order not to lose the orig-
inal meaning in translation. When English is used
in politeness, the reference translations often per-
form a normalization of titles and capitalization.
In that case, copying the English segments in the
French sentence to the MT output would produce
translations that are understandable, but would not
match the conventions used in the reference.

on detecting code-mixing to let an email trans-
lation system handle words created on the fly
by bilingual English-Spanish speakers (Manan-
dise and Gdaniec, 2011). While code-switched
data is traditionally viewed as noise when train-
ing machine translation systems, Huang and Yates
(2014) showed that appropriately detecting code-
switching can help inform word alignment and im-
prove machine translation quality.
There has been renewed interest on the study
of mixed language recently, focusing on detect-
ing code-switching points (Solorio and Liu, 2008;
Elfardy et al., 2013) and more generally detect-
ing mixed language documents. Lui et al. (2014)
use a generative mixture model reminiscent of La-
tent Dirichlet Allocation to detect mixed language
documents and the languages inside them. Un-
like the CRF-based approach of King and Abney
(2013), the languages involved do not need to be
known ahead of time. In contrast with all these
approaches, we work with parallel data with un-
balanced original languages.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982541666667">
We investigated whether code-switching occurs in
the Canadian Hansard parallel corpus.
We automatically detected mixed language seg-
ments using a two-step approach: (1) candidate
sentence selection based on frequent words in each
language and overlap between the two side of the
parallel corpus, and (2) tag each word in the seg-
ment as French or English using the CRF-based
approach of King and Abney (2013).
Manual evaluation showed that automatic de-
tection can be done with high precision when the
original language is French, but common words
generate many false positives which hurt preci-
sion in English. More research is needed to im-
prove recall, which is lower than precision in both
languages, and particularly low when the original
language is French. Further analysis reveals that
code-switching does occur within the mixed lan-
guage examples detected in the Canadian Hansard,
and suggests that it is used differently by French
and English speakers.
While much work is still needed to construct
larger evaluation suites with gold annotations, and
improving the detection and tagging of mixed

language sentences, this work suggests that the
proceedings of multilingual organizations such as
the Canadian Hansard can provide interesting test
beds for (1) corpus-based study of language choice
and code-switching, which can complement the
direct observation of meetings, as conducted by
Wodak et al. (2012), and (2) investigating the in-
teractions of code-switching and machine transla-
tion. Furthermore, it would be interesting to study
how code-switching in the Hansard differs from
code-switching in more informal settings.

We focus on the Canadian Hansard, and automatically detect mixed language segments based on simple corpus-based rules and an existing word-level language tagger. Manual evaluation shows that the performance of automatic detection varies significantly depending on the primary language. While 95% precision can be achieved when the original language is French, common words generate many false positives which hurt precision in English. Furthermore, we found that codeswitching does occur within the mixed languages examples detected in the Canadian Hansard, and it might be used differently by French and English speakers. This analysis suggests that parallel corpora such as the Hansard can provide interesting test beds for studying multilingual practices, including code-switching and its translation, and encourages us to collect more gold annotations to improve the characterization and detection of mixed language and code-switching in parallel corpora.</abstract>

While this question has been addressed, for instance, by conducting fieldwork in European Union institutions (Wodak et al., 2012), we aim to use natural language processing tools to study language choice directly from text, leveraging the publicly available proceedings of multilingual institutions, which are already widely used for machine translation. Early work on statistical approaches to machine translation (Brown et al., 1990) was made possible by the availability of the bilingual Canadian Hansard in electronic form1. Today, translated texts from the Hong Kong Legislative Council, the United Nations, the European Union are routinely used to build machine translation systems for many languages in addition to English and French (Wu, 1994; Koehn, 2005; Eisele and Chen, 2010, inter alia), and to port linguistic annotation from resource-rich to resource-poor languages (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Das and Petrov, 2011, among many others).

The study also shows that candidates have a wide range of attitudes towards bilingualism and the importance of language to their sense of identity (Hicks, 2007). This suggests that code-switching, and more generally language choice, might reveal an interesting range of multilingual practices in the Hansard. In this paper, we adopt a straightforward strategy to detect mixed language in the Canadian Hansard, using (1) constraints based on the parallel nature of the corpus and (2) a state-of-theart language detection technique (King and Abney, 2013). Based on this automatic annotation, we conduct a detailed analysis of results to address the following questions: • How hard is it to detect mixed language in the Canadian Hansard? What are the challenges raised by the Hansard domain for state-ofthe-art models? • Within these mixed language occurrences, does code-switching occur? What kind of patterns emerge from the code-switched text collected? After introducing the Canadian Hansard corpus (Section 2), we describe our strategy for automatically detecting mixed language use (Section 3). We will see that it is a challenging task: precision v</context>

These two goals can be accomplished simultaneously by a word-level language tagger. In a second stage, the automatically detected mixed language segments are used to manually study code-switching, since our mixed language tagger does not yet distinguish between codeswitching and other types of mixed language (e.g., borrowings). 3.2 Challenges When the identity of the languages mixed is known, the state-of-the-art approach to word-level language identification is the weakly supervised approach proposed by King and Abney (2013). They frame the task as a sequence labeling problem with monolingual text samples for training data. A Conditional Random Field (CRF) trained with generalized expectation criteria performs best, when evaluated on a corpus comprising 30 languages, including many low resources languages such as Azerbaijani or Ojibwa. In our case, there are only two high-resource languages involved, which could make the language detection task easier. However, the Hansard domain also presents many challenges: English and French are closely related languages and share many words; the Hansard corpus contains many </context>

It requires samples of a few thousand words of French and English for training. How can we select samples of English and French that are strictly monolingual? We solve this problem by leveraging the parallel nature of our corpus again: We assume that a segment is strictly monolingual if there is no overlap 5Except for numbers, punctuation marks and acronyms. fr mixed in en gold pos. gold neg. total predicted pos. 21 8 29 predicted neg. 1 109 110 total 22 117 139 Table 4: Confusion matrix for detecting segments containing French words when English is the original language.

It yields a Precision of 75% and a Recall of 18.75% in vocabulary between a segment and its translation. Using this approach, we randomly select a sample of 1000 monolingual French segments and 1000 monolingual English segments. This yields about 21k/4k word tokens/types for English, and 24k/4.6k for French. Using these samples, we apply the CRF approach on each candidate sentence selected during the previous step. For the low resource languages used by King and Abney (2013), the training samples were much smaller (in the order of hundreds of words per language), and learning curves suggest that the accuracy reaches a plateau very quickly. However, we decide to use larger samples since they are very easy to construct in our large data setting. 3.5 Evaluation At this stage, we do not have any gold annotation for code-switching or word-level language identification on the Hansard corpus. We therefore ask a bilingual human annotator to evaluate the precision of the approach for detecting mixed language segments on a small sample of 100 segments for each original lan</context>

Today, translated texts from the Hong Kong Legislative Council, the United Nations, the European Union are routinely used to build machine translation systems for many languages in addition to English and French (Wu, 1994; Koehn, 2005; Eisele and Chen, 2010, inter alia), and to port linguistic annotation from resource-rich to resource-poor languages (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Das and Petrov, 2011, among many others).

The part of the corpus drawn from meetings of the House of Commons, is often also called Hansard, while committees refers to the transcriptions of committee meetings. This corpus is well-suited to the study of multilingual interactions and their translation for two main reasons. First, the transcriptions are annotated with the original language for each intervention. Second, the translations are high quality direct translations between French and English. In contrast, a French-English sentence pair in the European Parliament corpus (Koehn, 2005) could have been generated from an original sentence in German that was translated into English, and then in turn from English into French. Direct translation eliminates the propagation of “translationese” effects (Volansky et al., 2013), and avoids losing track of code-switching examples by translation into a second or third language. One potential drawback of working with transcribed text is that the transcription process might remove pauses, repetitions and other disfluencies.

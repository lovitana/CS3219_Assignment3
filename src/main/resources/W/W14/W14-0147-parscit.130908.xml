IndoWordnet (Bhattacharyya, 2010) is a linked
lexical knowledge base consisting of wordnets of
various Indian languages, where each wordnet is
composed of synsets and semantic relations. This
resource is very useful for various NLP applica-
tions viz., Machine Translation, Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation, Sentimental Analysis, Information
Retrieval, etc. But to use this knowledge in an
effective way, a set of tools are required to que-
ry, retrieve and visualize information from this
knowledge base. Data visualization is the study
of the visual representation of data, meaning &amp;quot;in-
formation that has been abstracted in some
schematic form, including attributes or variables
for the units of information&amp;quot; (Friendly, 2008).
The main goal of visualization is to organize in-
formation clearly and effectively through graph-
ical means. We have developed a user interface
that provides a graphical representation of In-
doWordnet. Till date, no such tool was devel-
oped for visualizing the wordnet database for
Indian languages. The visualizer we developed
takes a word from a specific language as an input
and displays the related concepts of that word
depending upon its semantic and lexical relations
with other words in the wordnet.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2
covers a related work. Section 3 gives an over-
view of IndoWordnet. Section 4 describes In-
doWordnet visualizer. Section 5 gives implemen-
tation details. Conclusion and future work are
covered in Section 6.

There are many wordnet visualizers available for
browsing and exploring wordnets to better un-
derstand the concepts and semantic relations be-
tween them. Some of them include BabelNet ex-
plorer (Navigli, 2013), AndreOrd (Johannsen and
Pedersen, 2011), Visuwords1, Nodebox2, Word-
Ties (Pedersen et. al 2013), WordVis (Ver-
cruysse and Kuiper, 2011) etc. BabelNet explorer
is designed for visualizing the lexical database
BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). It uses
the tree layout for visualization which allows
intuitive navigation. It covers English, Italian,
Catalan, Spanish, German and French languages.
AndreOrd is the wordnet browser developed for
the Danish wordnet, DanNet. It uses the open
source framework Ruby on Rails and the gra-
phing toolkit Protovis3. Visuwords is the online
graphical dictionary designed for accessing
Princeton WorNet (Fellbaum, 1998). It uses a
force-directed graph layout for visualizing the
synset structure. Nodebox visualizer provides the
static layout. It does not use any color or shape
encoding in the graph. WordTies is the wordnet
visualizer designed for Nordic and Baltic word-
nets. It covers seven monolingual and four bilin-
gual wordnets. It has been made available via

3 Overview of IndoWordnet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99906188">
IndoWordnet is the most useful multilingual lex-
ical resource in Indian languages. Hindi wordnet
is created manually using lexical knowledge
from various dictionaries. Wordnets other than
Hindi have been created by using expansion ap-
proach with Hindi as a pivot language. It in-
cludes 18 Indian languages 5 viz., Assamese,
Bengali, Bodo, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri,
Nepali, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Manipu-
ri, Marathi, Nepali, Odiya, Punjabi, Sanskrit,
Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, etc. Expansion approach
makes use of the fact that there are several ‘uni-
versal concepts’ which are independent of the
language. If one language has synsets for univer-
sal concepts, then it makes sense to borrow this
work for some other language. For such univer-
sal concepts, the semantic relations remain same
across the languages. Hence one can directly bor-
row them for other languages. This principle is
used in the creation of IndoWordnet. All the se-
mantic relations for universal synsets are defined
in Hindi and are borrowed by other languages.
Expansion approach works very well for closely
related languages like ‘Hindi and Marathi’. The
current statistics of the IndoWordnet is shown in

5 Wordnets for Indian languages are developed in In-
doWordNet project. Wordnets are available in following
Indian languages: Assamese, Bodo, Bengali, English, Guja-
rati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Konkani, Kannada, Malayalam, Ma-
nipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu
and Urdu. These languages cover 3 different language fami-
lies, Indo Aryan, Sino-Tebetian and Dravidian.

IndoWordnet stores various relations among
words and synsets. These relations give an im-
portant knowledge about the language structure.
These are categorized under two labels viz., lex-
ical relations and semantic relations.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999526">
3.1 Lexical Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999571333333333">
Lexical relations are present between the words.
IndoWordnet contains different types of lexical
relations listed below,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999621888888889">
• Gradation (state, size, light, gender,
temperature, color, time, quality, action,
manner) (for all parts-of-speech)
• Antonymy (action, amount, direction,
gender, personality, place, quality, size,
state, time, color, manner) (for all parts-of-
speech)
• Compound (for nouns)
• Conjunction(for verbs)
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.95301">
3.2 Semantic Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977965">
Semantic relations are present between the
synsets. Different types of semantic relations are
given below,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97983235">
• Hypernymy (for noun and verbs)
• Holonymy ( nouns)
• Meronymy (component object, member
collection, feature, activity, place, area,
face, state, portion, mass, resource, pro-
cess, position, area)
• Troponymy (for verbs)
• Similar Attribute (between noun and ad-
jective)
• Function verb (between noun and verb)
• Ability verb (between noun and verb)
• Capability verb (between noun and verb)
• Also see
• Adverb modifies verb (between adverb
and verb)
• Causative (for verb)
• Entailment (for verb)
• Near synset
• Adjective modifies noun (between adjec-
tive and noun)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949631578948">
IndoWordnet provides extra relations (Na-
rayan et. al., 2002) in comparison with Princeton
wordnet, e.g., gradation, causative form, nominal
and verbal compounds, conjunction etc. All these
relations are covered in IndoWordnet Visualizer.
User can see these relations and understand them
better visually. All these relations are used while
finding the related concepts of a given word. The
need to make entirely different explorer for In-
doWordnet lies in its difference from other
wordnets in terms of the structure and relations.
The entirely different format makes it difficult to
import other visualizers directly. Manually going
through the wordnet relations takes very large
time. Visualizer makes this process extremely
efficient and intuitive. This motivated us to cre-
ate a new visualizer for IndoWordnet. Developed
GUI is enriched with various facilities as ex-
plained in Section 4.

IndoWordnet visualizer is designed for visualiz-
ing the IndoWordnet database. It is made publi-
cally available on IndoWordnet website6. Related
concepts of a given input word are extracted at
different levels and a sub graph is displayed on a
screen. The user interface layout and its features
are described below.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.795499">
4.2 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.911876071428572">
Interface is enhanced with the following fea-
tures, which provide flexibility to the user to
visualize the wordnet database.
• Nodes are automatically arranged on the
screen according to physics and depending
on the total number of nodes. The repul-
sion between the nodes and the link dis-
tance is optimally calculated so as to dis-
play all nodes clearly. Here, nodes are
nothing but the concepts from IndoWord-
net. For a given input word, all related
concepts are extracted from IndoWordnet
and are displayed at appropriate positions
on the screen.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995964689655172">
• The size of the node varies according to
the number of its immediate neighbor. A
node consisting large number of neighbors
is bigger in size than a node with less
number of neighbors. This highlights
more frequent words against less frequent
ones.
• When a user moves a mouse pointer over
a particular node, it highlights all its im-
mediate neighbors along with that node.
(Screenshot 6)
• When a user moves a mouse pointer over
a particular edge, it highlights the type of
relation exist between the nodes. Different
color encodings are used for displaying
the lexical and semantic relations.
(Screenshot 3)
• User can click, drag, expand and fix
nodes for better visibility. (Screenshot 4)
• Zoom in and zoom out facilities are also
provided.
• When a user clicks on a node all its se-
mantic information is displayed on the
screen. It includes synset id, synset words,
gloss, and example sentence.
• Download option is provided in order to
get all the information displayed on a
screen which is helpful for different NLP
applications.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998423">
4.3 Visualization Schemes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9968665">
In an interface, we provided two types of visual
schemes.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9906425">
1. By the number of levels
2. By the number of nodes
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999566941176471">
In the first scheme, for a given concept, relat-
ed concepts are extracted according to different
levels e.g., immediate neighbors, neighbors of
immediate neighbors and so on. Sometimes due
to large number of neighboring concepts user
may face difficulty in visualization. For example,
for the Hindi concept ‘मानवकृति’ (man-made) giv-
en below, the number of extracted related con-
cepts at different levels are shown in Table 2.
As number of levels increases, number of
nodes (related concepts) for the concept also in-
creases drastically. It is very difficult to render
such kind of concepts on a screen. That’s why
we provided a second visualization scheme in
which user has been given a facility to choose
number of nodes to be displayed on the screen
(Screenshot 7).

5 Implementation details
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999937428571429">
The front-end of the IndoWordnet Visualizer
uses Data Driven Documents (D3) JavaScript
library, which allows us to present the data of
nodes and edges from the back-end, graphically.
This library allows us to define geometry for
nodes and edges so as to automatically arrange
them efficiently, while also allowing the user to
click, drag and fix any node for better visibility.
The library uses Scalable Vector Graphics
(SVG), which allows us to zoom into the graph
without pixelating the nodes, links or labels. The
superiority of D3 lies in its support for dynamic
behavior allowing user-friendly interaction and
animation.

<bodyText confidence="0.999931307692308">
We have presented the IndoWordnet visualizer
which can be used for browsing and exploring
IndoWordnet lexical database. It is enhanced
with various functionalities in order to provide
flexibility to the user. It is very useful for word-
net validation process. It can be used in various
Natural Language Processing applications viz.,
Word Sense Disambiguation, Information Re-
trieval, Semantic Relatedness etc. IndoWordnet
visualizer is under development and some more
features are yet to be included like generating the

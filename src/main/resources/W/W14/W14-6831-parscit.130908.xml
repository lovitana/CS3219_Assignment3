Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999369212121212">
Personal attributes extraction plays a significant role
in information mining, event tracing and personal
name disambiguation. It mainly involves two
problems, attribute recognition and decision making
on whether this attribute belongs to the extracted
person. Personal attributes generally involve named
entities, which are recognized mainly by adjusting
word segmentation software. As for those which
cannot be recognized by word segmentation, the
combination of feature words and rules can be used
for their recognition. The combination of sentences
classifications and rules is employed for attribute
ownership decision. At first, all the sentences in the
document are classified into those with attribute
words and those without, with the latter omitted.
The former are then classified into description
sentences with one person and description sentences
with more persons, according to the criterion that
whether there are more than one person described in
the sentence. According to statistics of description
sentences with one person, anaphora resolution is
not necessary, which reduces recognition errors
from anaphora resolution failures. Minimum slicing
is used for description sentences with more persons,
and attribute ownership decision is made within the
minimum language segment with the co-occurrence
of both the person and the attribute. This method
achieves 0.507388780 and 0.489505010
respectively in the lenient evaluation results and the
strict evaluation results of SF_Value in
CIPS-SIGHAN20141 Bakeoff, which turns out to
be the best. The fact has shown that the method is
effective.

inherent in things(Zhuang, 2000). Personal
attribute extraction aims
at automatically extracting in unstructured texts
specific attributes associated with the personal
name, such as the character entity&apos;s date of birth,
work units, spouses, children, education, title, etc.
This plays a significant role in information
mining, event tracing and personal name
disambiguation. International TAC KBP has been
conducted since 2009 (Bikel et al., 2009;
McNamee et al., 2009), and CIPS-SIGHAN2014
has referred to and revised its Slot Filling tasks to
design personal attribute extraction tasks in
Chinese. There are six groups participating this
bakeoff.
Personal attribute extraction mainly involves two
problems, attribute recognition and decision
making on whether this attribute belongs to the
extracted person, and the latter can be called
attribute ownership decision. Personal attributes
are generally named entities, such as personal
names, place names, organization names,
temporal nouns, so named entity recognition
technology is needed in attribute recognition.
Although named entity recognition is one
difficulty in natural language processing, there
are plenty of experiences and methods we can
draw upon as 30 years has witnessed its research
since the introduction of Chinese word
segmentation, as in (Sun et al., 1995; Zhao et al.,
1999; Liao et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2006; Ye et al.,
2007). Therefore, this paper focuses upon
attribute ownership decision after a brief
introduction to personal attribute extraction, since
the former is more complicated with anaphora
resolution and attribute ownership decision
among more persons. Some of bakeoff papers

regarding filling slot have noticed these problems,
as in (Bikel et al., 2009; Burman et al., 2012). In
this paper, we propose attribute ownership
decision through the combination of sentences
classifications and rules in accordance with
natural language features and the task
requirements of our bakeoff. This method has
achieved good results in the evaluation. The rest
of the paper is organized as: Section 2 introduces
main ideas, Section 3 presents the methods of
personal attribute recognition, Section 4

personal attribute ownership decision, Section 5

2 Main ideas
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999810625">
Attribute recognition is mainly named entity
recognition, which is attempted to be settled in
word segmentation in our study. According to
attribute recognition task requirements, the word
segmentation software used in this study has been
adjusted so that it can recognize most named
entities. As for those which cannot be recognized
by the software, the method of feature words
together with rules has been employed. After
attribute recognition, all the sentences in the
document are classified into those with attribute
words and those without, with the latter omitted.
Therefore, attribute ownership decision is merely
conducted to the sentences marked with attribute
words.
Now that the anaphora of personal pronouns are
widely used in most sentences, attribute
ownership decision involves anaphora resolution,
which means the determination of the antecedent
of the anaphor(Wang, 2005). Anaphora resolution
appears to be difficult in Chinese, far from being
settled completely satisfactorily(Wang, 2002;
Wang 2005). In order to decrease the reliance on
anaphora resolution, we have studied the tested
documents and found that the described person in
most of them is the extracted character. When
most sentences in a document describe the
extracted person, it is not necessary to employ
anaphora resolution. Anaphora resolution or some
other methods are needed to find the attribute of
the extracted person only for those sentences with
more persons. In a small number of documents,
there is only one extracted person within the
whole text, such as “马伟明_T1.xml” and “白志
东 _T1.xml”. As such, in attribute ownership
decision, it should be determined whether there
are more than two persons described in the
sentence. In this way, the sentences marked with
attribute words in the document will be classified
as description sentences with one person and
description sentences with more persons through
some methods, which would decrease the
reliance on anaphora resolution and so greatly
improve decision precision by decreasing the
recognition errors from anaphora resolution
failures. The challenge here is how to determine
those sentences with more persons, which will be
expounded later.

3 Personal attribute recognition

<bodyText confidence="0.999914166666667">
Personal attribute recognition involves two jobs.
One is to adjust word segmentation software in
order to achieve full recognition of various types
of named entities, and the other is to annotate
feature words to ensure exact decision of attribute
identity of some named entities.

3.1 Adjusting word segmentation software
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954285714286">
Named entity recognition is mainly completed in
word segmentation. The word segmentation
software used is CUCBst, a dictionary and rule
based software developed by Broadcasting Media
Center, Communications University of China.
The adjustment includes: adjustmenting tagging,
adding words, and adjusting rules.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99336">
3.1.1 Adjustmenting Tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998230857142857">
First, some tags are adjusted in the dictionary.
Take some words associated with titles as an
example. In the dictionary, there are items such as
“程序员(programmer) n”, “雕刻师(sculptor) n”,
“董事长(president) n”, “发明家(inventor) n” and
“检察长(chief-prosecutor) n”. The tag of “n”
within is adjusted to be “tt”. For instance:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6221505">
Example Sentence 1: 可见魏冉
..这位封建社会地
主阶级的政治家,在完成秦王朝统一中国的事
业中所起的作用。
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.961839">
Translation: As a feudal politician of landlord
class, in the cause of uniting China by Qin
dynasty, Wei Ran&apos;s role is clearly demonstrated.
Its tagged version is:
可见/c 魏冉/nr 这位/r 封建社会/ln 地主/n 阶

<page confidence="0.998527">

统一/a 中国/gj 的/u 事业/n 中/f 所/u 起/v 的
/u 作用/n 。/w
Through the tagging adjustment, it is easy to
recognize the title of the extracted person “魏冉
(Wei Ran)” is “政治家(statesman)”. We also
adjust the tagging of death reasons(sw),
nations(gj), provincial cities(sh), cities and
towns(sx). In addition, some feature words are
annotated. For example, the feature words
associated with character birth such as “生于(be
born)”, “出生(be born)” and “诞生(be born)” are
annotated as “bir”.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.947966">
3.1.2 Adding words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922235294118">
There are two stages in adding words:
Stage One is to collect and sort dictionaries in
system development, adding names such as titles,
nations and places to the segmentation dictionary.
Stage Two is to add OOV words to the
segmentation dictionary in evaluation period by
implementing new words automatic recognized
in evaluation corpus with manual intervention. It
should be pointed out that some certain noun
phrase is regarded as one word and then kept in
the dictionary. These noun phrases are mainly
organization titles, nicknames and titles such as
“北平研究院物理研究所(Institute of Physics of
Peking Academy of Sciences)”, “罗彻斯特储蓄
银行(Rochester Bank)”, “橙县小姐(Miss Orange
County)” and “ 名 誉 理 事 长 (Honorary
chairman)”.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99198">
3.1.3 Adjusting rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997428">
CUCBst segmentation system is characterized by
coarse-grained segmentation and fine-grained
segmentation, which is implemented by rules. We
adjust some merging rules so that they can
achieve better attribution recognition. For
example:
Example Sentence 2: 斯托曼 1953 年出生于美
国纽约曼哈顿地区的犹太人家庭。
Translation: Stallman was born of a Jewish
family in Manhattan, New York, in 1953.
Its segmented version before the rule adjustment
is:
coarse-grained segmentation:斯托曼/nr 1953 年
/t 出生/v 于/p 美国纽约曼哈顿地区/ns 的/u
犹太人/n 家庭/n
fine-grained segmentation:斯托曼/nr 1953 年/t
出生/v 于/p 美国/ns 纽约/ns 曼哈顿/ns 地区
/n 的/u 犹太人/n 家庭/n
In the coarse-grained segmentation version, “美
国 纽 约 曼 哈 顿 地 区 ”, which includes two
personal attributes in accordance with evaluation
outline, country of birth and city of birth, is
merged together. Further analyses and processes
are needed for correct recognition. In the
fine-grained segmentation version, “美国纽约曼
哈顿地区” is divided into 4 words as “美国/ns
纽约/ns 曼哈顿/ns 地区/n”, in which country
of birth is correctly segmented. However, city of
birth needs further processes by merging the
following three words. Example Sentence 2’s
segmented version after the rule adjustment is:
斯托曼/nr 1953 年/t 出生/v 于/p 美国/gj
纽约曼哈顿地区/ns 的/u 犹太人/n 家庭/n
In this version, “美 国 纽 约 曼 哈 顿 地 区 ” is
segmented into 2 words as “美国/gj 纽约曼哈
顿地区/ns”, which are country of birth and city
of birth respectively. This makes the recognition
and extraction of related attributes convenient.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9798665">
3.2 Finding nearest named entity through
the feature word
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999334384615384">
Although some specific tagging aimed for named
entities and some personal attributes is conducted
in word segmentation, it should be noted that not
all tagged named entities are personal attributes.
For example, 1998 is not always a person’s date
of birth, since it could be the date for an event or
something else. Therefore, it is necessary to
decide personal attribute through the feature word,
and find nearest named entity through the feature
word within the sentence. Take the example of
time of birth:
Example Sentence 3: 张幼仪/nr 生于/bir 1900
年/t ,/w 比/p 徐志摩/nr 小/a 4/m 岁/q 。/w
Translation: Zhang Youyi was born in 1900, and
she was four years younger than Xu Zhimo.
Example Sentence 4: 鲁桂珍/nr 1904 年/t 生于
/bir 南京/ns
Translation: In 1904, Lu Guizhen was born in
Nanjing.
When segmented, “生于(be born)” is tagged as
“bir”, which means the word is a feature word
associated with a person’s birth. When there is
“bir” in a sentence, the system will iterate before
and after this feature word to find the nearest
time noun, as in Example Sentence 3, 1900 is
after the feature word and in Sentence 4, 1904 is
</bodyText>

before the feature word.
4 Deciding whether the attribute
belongs to the extracted person
In this section, we first classify the sentences in
two levels in order to decide the attribute
ownership in the classified sentence. As for the
description sentence with one person, decide
whether the character is the extracted object. If
not, just omit the sentence. As for the description
sentence with more persons, decide personal
attribute ownership by extracting the personal
attribute within the minimum language segment
with the co-occurrence of both the person and the
attribute.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998094">
4.1 Sentence classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9559284">
Sentence classification involves two levels. First,
the sentences are classified into sentences with or
without attribute marks. Then, classify the
sentences with attribute marks into those with
one person and those with more persons.
4.1.1 Classifying all the sentences into two
types
All the attributes and feature words are marked in
word segmentation. In terms of these marks, all
the sentences are classified into two types. Those
without attribute marks will be directly omitted,
whereas those with attribute marks will be kept
for further processing.
4.1.2 Classifying the sentences with attribute
marks into two types
The sentences with attribute marks are classified
into those with one described person and those
with 2 or more than 2 described persons.
Character recognition is significant in this step.
The forms to recognize characters include
personal names, only surnames or first names,
personal pronouns, zero form and kinship titles,
in which personal names and kinship titles can be
either antecedent or anaphora, the rest three can
only be anaphora.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.450986" genericHeader="method">
(1) personal names
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983772555555556">
Personal names are the most important feature to
detect characters. For example:
Example Sentence 5. 1973 年 7 月 19 日,冯白驹
在北京逝世。
Translation: On July 19, 1973, Feng Baiju passed
away in Beijing.
Example Sentence 6. 次年 1 月,王文明病逝,
冯白驹继任中共琼崖特委书记。
Translation: In January of the next year, Wang
Wenming passed away, and Feng Baiju take
Wang&apos; place to be the Special Secretary of CPC
in Qiongya.
Here, the number of personal names in the
sentence will decide whether the sentence is the
one with one described person. Example
Sentence 5 is the sentence with one described
person, for there is one personal name “冯白驹”
within, whereas Example Sentence 6 is the
sentence with more described persons, for there
are two personal names within, “王文明” and “冯
白驹”.
(2) only surnames or first names
As for non-Chinese names, the whole name is
used first and then generally the surname is used
for anaphora. For example:
Example Sentence 7. 莫奈 ..1840 年 11 月 14 日出
生于法国巴黎 45 街拉菲特第九郡,是阿道夫和
路易斯的第二个儿子。(克劳德·莫奈)
Translation: Monet was born on November 14,
1840, in 45 Street, the 9th canton of Lafayette,
Paris, France; and he was the second son of Adolf
and Louis. (Claude Monet)
When using the surname would be confusing,
first names will be used, as in the introduction to
the twin brothers, “Mike Bryan” and “Bob
Bryan”, in Example Sentence 8.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.6854675">
例句 8. 等到鲍勃
..和迈克

<bodyText confidence="0.908683066666667">
..开始真正对网球产生

Translation: Until Bob and Mike really grew
strong interests in tennis and began their tennis
career, Bryans set up a catch for them. Before 17
years old, the twins were not permitted to
compete in game.
Generally speaking, the whole name is used for
the Chinese name. However, only surnames or
first names could be used. For example:
Example Sentence 9. 七七事变后,日本人邀请
他组建“中日友好协会”,梁意识到,要想不当
汉奸,必须立即离开北平。(梁思成)
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.966242333333333">

Example Sentence 10. 我与泽涵兄交往多了,与
他的家人都处得很熟。(江泽涵)
Translation: After frequent contacts with Bro
Zehan, I got well acquainted with his families.
(Jiang Zehan)
When only surnames or first names are used, it is
a little difficult to recognize them. Once
recognized, it is as easy to decide whether there is
one person or there are more persons in the
sentence, as in the case of personal names.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.78293">
(3) personal pronouns
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975413185185185">
Anaphora means that another component is used
to refer to the prior component in order to avoid
its repeat in the text(Xu 2003). There are three
forms of anaphora, zero anaphora, pronominal
anaphora and NP anaphora(Chen, 1987). In the
personal attribute extraction, personal pronouns
are anaphora with obvious forms and are used as
one of the features to detect characters. For
example:
Example Sentence 11. 江泽涵是中国数学会的
创始人之一,从 1935 年该会成立时起,他就是
副理事长。(江泽涵)
Translation: Jiang Zehan, one of the founders of
the Chinese Mathematics Society, has been the
vice chairman since the association was founded
in 1935. (Jiang Zehan)
When the character is detected, a single personal
pronoun (such as he, she, you and I) used in one
sentence, even with several occurrences, will be
regarded as only one person, for in one sentence,
it is rare to use the same single personal pronoun
to refer to different persons.
Generally the sentence with plural personal
pronouns includes more persons. For example:
Example Sentence 12. 李约瑟一如既往忠于他
的爱妻:“执子之手、与子偕老,”直到 1987
年德萝西 91 岁时去世,他们夫妇共同生活了整

Translation: Joseph Needham was always loyal to
his beloved wife, just as the famous Chinese
saying goes, &amp;quot;Holding your hand, lead our merry
life till old&amp;quot;. Until De Luoxi left at the age of 91
in 1987, the couple had lived together for a full
64 years.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.534661">
(4) kinship titles
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.95854106">
When the extracted person is introduced, some
other related persons will be mentioned.
Relatives, such as parents, the wife and brothers,
are often mentioned. Besides, some other
connections may also be mentioned, such as
teachers, friends and leaders. The kinship titles
have obvious form features and can be used for
detecting characters in the sentence. For example:
Example Sentence 13. 布兰切特的降生充满了
浪漫色彩,爸爸是美国前海军军官,军舰在澳
洲墨尔本停靠时,与布兰切特的母亲相识。(凯
特·布兰切特)
Translation: Blanchett birth is full of romance.
His father, a former US Navy officer, met
Blanchett mother when the warship docked in
Melbourne, Australia. (Cate Blanchett)
In Example Sentence 13, there are three persons,
“Blanchett”, “father” and “mother”.
In addition, we also find that when some
attributes of the extracted person’s teacher,
student, friend or leader are described, this
person’s name will appear. However, when a
teacher, a student or a professor is used in a
general sense, he or she has little thing to do with
attribute extraction, so he or she will not be
regarded as a character. For example:
Example Sentence 14. 但法伊弗却透露,自己上
高中的时候很不受欢迎,“我那时很高,很笨拙,
老师曾经在我的成绩单上写过‘米歇尔是班里
个子最大的女孩’”。
Translation: But Pfeiffer has revealed that she
was very unpopular in high school, &amp;quot;At that time,
I am very tall but somehow clumsy, and my
teacher once wrote on my report card &apos;Michelle is
the tallest Girl in class&apos;&amp;quot;.
Example Sentence 15. 梅耶的死让很多人震惊,
他的同事和学生认为他是一个非常有才华的科
学家和教师。
Translation: Meyer&apos;s death shocked a lot of
people, both his colleagues and students believed
that he was a very talented scientist and teacher.
Example Sentence 16. 需要提出的是,卡罗瑟斯

卡罗瑟斯的基础上,出版了影响整个世界的《高
分子化学原理》一书,该书依然是今天高分子
领域主要的理论基础。
Translation: I must point out that Carothers’
student Paul Flory (1910-1985), on the basis of

<bodyText confidence="0.999727636363636">
the whole globe. The book is still the bible-like
theoretical basis of today&apos;s realm of polymer.
“老师(the teacher)” in Example Sentence 14, “同
事 、 学生 (colleagues, students)” in Example
Sentence 15 are used in a general sense, so both
sentences are ones with one person. Instead,
Example Sentence 16 makes clear the date of
birth, date of death, and some other information,
concerning Carothers’ student, Paul J. Flory(with
a specific name for the student), so the sentence
is one with more persons.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99747">
4.2 Attribute ownership decision
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982491626865672">
By employing the above mentioned character
recognition features to classify the sentences, we
get two sentence sets, the description sentences
with one person (including zero anaphora) and
the description sentences with more persons.
4.2.1 The description sentences with one
person
(1) affirming the extracted person
As for the sentences with personal names,
including with only first names or surnames, the
extracted persons’ names, including first names
or surnames, are used for the match. The
difficulty lies in the sentences with personal
pronouns and zero form. As mentioned above,
most documents in the testing texts mainly
describe extracted persons, thus when the
description sentences with one person involve
personal pronouns and zero form, it can be
hypothesized that extracted persons are directly
used as described persons. In order to test this
hypothesis, we study the use of the third singular
personal pronoun “他(he)” in all the sentences.
Through automated recognition, we obtain 369
sentences with one person which have “他(he)”.
Then we identify all the sentences to see whether
“他(he)” is the anaphora of the extracted person.
Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the results.
As illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, 356 sentences,
in 112 documents, with “他(he)” as the anaphora
of the extracted person, account for 96 percent of
all the sentences, whereas 14 sentences, in 5
documents, with “他(he)” not as the anaphora of
the extracted person, account for only 4 percent
of all the sentences. We study these 5 documents
and find that the chiefly described person is not
the extracted person in 3 documents, which are
“鲁桂珍_T2.xml”, “鲁桂珍_T3.xml” and “陈济
棠_T3.xml”. In “鲁桂珍_T2.xml” and “鲁桂珍
_T3.xml”, the chiefly described person is 鲁桂
珍’s husband, 李约瑟, not the extracted person,
鲁 桂 珍 . In “ 陈 济 棠 _T3.xml”, he chiefly
described person is 陈济棠’s son, 陈树柏, not
the extracted person, 陈济棠. In this document,
there are 5 sentences with one person which have
“他(he)”. There are 4 sentences with “他(he)” not
as the anaphora of the extracted person, while
there is only one sentences with “他(he)” as the
anaphora of the extracted person. Thus we call
this document as one with overlaps. The other
two documents are “马伟明_T3.xml” and “白志
东_T3.xml” respectively. Although the chiefly
described person is the extracted person in both
documents, the narrative perspective is
first-person perspective.
In addition, we also perform statistical analysis of
the use of zero form. As there are a number of
zero anaphora, 193 sentences with zero anaphora
are randomly chosen from 126 documents. Then
we identify all these sentences to see whether
there is the anaphora of the extracted person. The
results are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.
As illustrated in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, zero anaphora
shares similar use with the anaphora of the third
singular pronoun “他(he)”. By analyzing the
documents with zero anaphora not referred to the
extracted person, we find that the chiefly
described person is not the extracted person.

However, there is no first-person perspective,
which is quite different from the case of the third
singular pronoun “他(he)”.
The data above demonstrate that our hypotheses
are in line with reality. If we have had classified
the documents in terms of some features such as
the chiefly described person and narrative
perspectives and then classified the sentences in
documents, we would have achieved better
results.
(2) attribute extraction
The extracted character in the description
sentence with one person is affirmed at first. If
the character is not the extracted object, omit the
sentence. If the character is the extracted object,
attributes are extracted and put into different
attribute lists in terms of marks. For example:
Example Sentence 17. 1943 年 11 月/t ,/w 白
志东/nr 出生/bir 于/p 河北省/sh 乐亭县/sx。/w
Translation: In November, 1943, Bai Zhidong
was born in Leting County, Hebei Province.
According to the feature word “出生(birth)” and
attribute marks, the attributes of “1943 年 11 月
(Nov. 1943)”, “河北省(Hebei province)” and “乐
亭县(Laoting county)” are put into such attribute
lists as date of birth, province of birth and city of
birth(including towns and villages) of the
extracted person “白志东”.

persons
Attribute ownership decision in the description
sentences with more persons turns out be the
challenge of this evaluation task. For example:
Example Sentence 18. 李济深升为军长,陈济棠
升任第十一师师长。(陈济棠)
Translation: Li Jishen was promoted to an army
corps commander, and Chen Jitang was promoted
to be the commander of eleventh division. (Chen
Jitang)
In this sentence, “军长(army commander)” is the
title of “ 李 济 深 ”, while “ 师 长 (divisional
commander)” is the title of “陈济棠”, a person to
be extracted. Attribute ownership decision
requires us to correctly recognize “陈济棠” and
then extract it. We mainly employ minimum
slicing with the co-occurrence of the extracted
person and the attribute and the nearest distance
principle to decide attribute ownership, which
will be expounded below.

<listItem confidence="0.921737">
(1) minimum co-occurrence slicing
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.961288666666667">
When the person and the attribute co-occur in the
same grammatical unit as minimum as possible,
and there is only one person, the attribute belongs
to the person. For example:
Example Sentence 19. 1947 年 4 月冀察热辽军
区部队改编为东北民主联军第八纵队,黄永胜
任司令,丁盛任二十四师师长,之后参加了辽
沈战役。
Translation: In April, 1947, the troops of
Ji-Cha-Re-Liao military region were reorganized
as the 8th Army of the Northeast Democratic
Coalition Force. Huang Yongsheng became the
commander, and Ding Sheng took the post of
commander of 24th division, then they took part
in the Liaoning-Shenyang Campaign.
Example Sentence 20. 1935 年,蒋中正调张学良
东北军剿共,西安出现以西北剿匪总司令部副
总司令张学良、西安绥靖公署主任杨虎城和陕
西省政府主席邵力子为首三种势力并存局面。
(杨虎城)
Translation: In 1935, Chiang Kai-shek dispatched
Zhang Xueliang&apos;s Northeast Army to conquer the
communist power. There coexisted three powers
in Xi&apos;an, ie the power of Zhan Xueliang, who was
the Vice Commander in chief of Northeast
Anti-communist Army; the power of Yang
Hucheng, who was the director of Xi&apos;an
Appeasement Administrative Office; and the
power of Shao Lizi, who as the governor of
Shaanxi provincial government. (Yang Hucheng)
In the two clauses of Example Sentence 19, “黄
永胜任司令” and “丁盛任二十 四师师长”
means the title of “司令(commander)” belongs to
“黄永胜”, while the title of “师长(divisional
commander)” belongs to “丁盛”. In Example
Sentence 20, “副总司令张学良”, “主任杨虎城”
and “主席邵力子” show that the person and the
attribute co-occur in the same subject-predicate
phrase.

<listItem confidence="0.677369">
(2) the nearest distance principle
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999271875">
When there is a long distance between the person
and the attribute, and at the same time, there are
more persons in the sentence, the attribute
belongs to the person with the nearest distance.
Example Sentence 21. 钱三强的父亲钱玄同是

Example Sentence 23. 薛万彻的二哥薛万淑,也

Translation: Xue Wanche&apos;s second brother, Xue
Wanshu also made daring military exploits, who
used to be a general of the right wing, Duke of
Liang Jun, and Commander in Chief of
Changwudao.( Wanren Xue)
In Example Sentence 21, the title “语言文字学家
(linguist)” belongs to “钱玄同” instead of “钱三
强”, for the distance between the title “语言文字
学 家 (linguist)” and the person “ 钱 玄 同 ” is
smaller. The situations in Example Sentence 22
and Example Sentence 23 are also like this. It
should be noted that the nearest distance principle
is not always effective, as in the following
example sentence.
Example Sentence 24. 中共四大后,彭述之以中
央委员身份接替多病的蔡和森担任中央宣传部
长,为了工作方便,蔡和森夫妇、彭述之夫妇

Translation: After the 4th National Congress of
CPC, as a member of the Central Committee of
CPC, Peng Shuzhi take the place of Cai Hesen,
who was sick, to be the minister of the State of
Central Propaganda Ministry. In order to
facilitate the work, both Hesens and Shuzhis
lived in the apartments of Propaganda Ministry.
In Example Sentence 24, the title “ 部 长
(minister)” belongs to “彭 述 之 ”, the person
which has a longer distance. This sentence needs
deeper syntax or semantic analysis, which is a
little difficult to process at present.

system’s efficiencies. The system performance
could be improved in 3 aspects:
1. to establish the word segmentation system
specific for personal attribute extraction.
2. to establish grammatical knowledge system
regarding personal attribute extraction, For
example, “我父亲住在北京(My father lived in
Beijing)” is different from “我和父亲住在北京
(My father and I live in Beijing)”, with “我父亲”
as a modifier-head construction in the former and
“我和父亲” as a parallel construction in the
latter.
3. to establish semantic knowledge system
regarding personal attribute extraction, For
example, in the sentence of “凯利与女演员劳

settled in Goatstown.)”, certain semantic
knowledge is needed to correctly extract the

<bodyText confidence="0.997835363636364">
This bakeoff is full of challenges with a number
of personal attributes to be extracted. CUCBst,
the word segmentation software, plays a
significant role in named entity recognition,
which provides a solid foundation for attribute
extraction. The strategy of sentence
classifications is employed in attribute ownership
decision, which, though cannot solve all the
problems, simplifies analyses. This strategy plays
a role in improving precision in attribute
ownership decision.

<abstract confidence="0.9807392">houmin@cuc.edu.cn tengyonglin@cuc.edu.cn Abstract Personal attributes extraction plays a significant role in information mining, event tracing and personal name disambiguation. It mainly involves two problems, attribute recognition and decision making on whether this attribute belongs to the extracted person. Personal attributes generally involve named entities, which are recognized mainly by adjusting word segmentation software. As for those which cannot be recognized by word segmentation, the combination of feature words and rules can be used for their recognition. The combination of sentences classifications and rules is employed for attribute ownership decision. At first, all the sentences in the document are classified into those with attribute words and those without, with the latter omitted. The former are then classified into description sentences with one person and description sentences with more persons, according to the criterion that whether there are more than one person described in the sentence. According to statistics of description sentences with one person, anaphora resolution is not necessary, which reduces recognition errors from anaphora resolution failures. Minimum slicing is used for description sentences with more persons, and attribute ownership decision is made within the minimum language segment with the co-occurrence of both the person and the attribute. This method achieves 0.507388780 and 0.489505010 respectively in the lenient evaluation results and the strict evaluation results of SF_Value in Bakeoff, which turns out to be the best. The fact has shown that the method is effective.</abstract>

The fact has shown that the method is effective. 1 Introduction Attribute, characterized by its objectivity, is 1 http://www.cipsc.org.cn/clp2014/webpage/en/home_en.htm inherent in things(Zhuang, 2000). Personal attribute extraction aims at automatically extracting in unstructured texts specific attributes associated with the personal name, such as the character entity&apos;s date of birth, work units, spouses, children, education, title, etc. This plays a significant role in information mining, event tracing and personal name disambiguation. International TAC KBP has been conducted since 2009 (Bikel et al., 2009; McNamee et al., 2009), and CIPS-SIGHAN2014 has referred to and revised its Slot Filling tasks to design personal attribute extraction tasks in Chinese. There are six groups participating this bakeoff. Personal attribute extraction mainly involves two problems, attribute recognition and decision making on whether this attribute belongs to the extracted person, and the latter can be called attribute ownership decision. Personal attributes are generally named entities, such as personal names, place names, organization names, temporal nouns, so named entity recognition technology is needed in at</context>

Therefore, this paper focuses upon attribute ownership decision after a brief introduction to personal attribute extraction, since the former is more complicated with anaphora resolution and attribute ownership decision among more persons. Some of bakeoff papers 192 Proceedings of the Third CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing, pages 192–201, Wuhan, China, 20-21 October 2014 regarding filling slot have noticed these problems, as in (Bikel et al., 2009; Burman et al., 2012). In this paper, we propose attribute ownership decision through the combination of sentences classifications and rules in accordance with natural language features and the task requirements of our bakeoff. This method has achieved good results in the evaluation.

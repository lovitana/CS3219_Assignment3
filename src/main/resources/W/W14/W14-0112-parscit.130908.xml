Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998687761904762">
The IndoWordNet1 Consortium consists of mem-
ber institutions developing WordNet using the
expansion approach.
The WordNets developed using expansion ap-
proach are very much influenced by the source
language and may not reflect the richness of the
target language (Walawalikar et al., 2010). And
therefore the IndoWordNet Community decided
to develop concepts which were specific to their
respective language viz. language-specific con-
cepts which will help in increasing the WordNet
coverage. Besides the above requirement it was
also felt that it should be possible to maintain ad-
ditional information about the concepts i.e. an
image, document describing the concept, links to
websites and other resources, etc.
In this paper, we discuss a Concept Space Synset
Management Tool (CSS)2 which was developed
to assist creation of language specific con-
cepts/synsets and manage their linkages to other
Indian language WordNets.

The IndoWordNet is a multilingual WordNet

called as synset Id given to each concept
(Bhattacharyya, 2010). WordNet is designed to
capture the vocabulary of a language and can be
considered as a dictionary cum thesaurus and
much more (Miller, et al., 1993; Miller, 1995;
Fellbaum, 1998).
Synset (Fellbaum, 1998) is composed of a gloss
describing the concept, example sentences and a
set of synonym words that are used for the con-
cept. Besides synset data, WordNet maintains
many lexical and semantic relations. Table1
gives the number of concepts/synsets created by
the language groups of the Indradhanush Word-
Net Consortium which is a part of the In-
doWordNet Consortium.

<bodyText confidence="0.99996125">
Also a sense marked newspaper corpus (sense
marking is a task to tag each word of the corpus
with the WordNet sense) consisting of minimum
1,00,000 words has been created by each of the
members of the Indradhanush WordNet Consor-
tium. The coverage is found to be low. In order
to increase the coverage of the WordNet it was
decided that a corpus will be created by all lan-
guage groups and the corpus will be sense
marked.
To increase the coverage it was decided to add
the concepts which were specific to their respec-
tive language viz. language-specific concepts and
nullify the effect of influence of the source lan-
guage on the target language WordNet. The CSS
Manager Tool3 was developed to assist in crea-
tion of language-specific concepts, linking to
other language WordNets, providing additional
information about synsets, etc. The features and
the detailed framework of the CSS Manager Tool
is explained in section 3 and 4.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows –
section 2 introduces the related work. The fea-
tures of CSS Manager Tool are presented in sec-
tion 3; section 4 presents the architecture of CSS
Manager Tool. Section 5 presents the implemen-

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999762">
For many Indian languages, WordNets are con-
structed using the expansion model where Hindi
WordNet synsets are taken as a source using the
MultiDict Tool (Chatterjee, 2010) created by IIT
Bombay. The tool also had feature to add com-
ments and references but it was not an ideal tool
for creation of language-specific synsets.
The limitations of the MultiDict Tool are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98586775">
• Creating and linking of language-
specific synsets across languages was
not possible,
• finding the overlap of synsets across lan-
guages was not possible,
• Feature to provide additional information
about the synset was not present,
• Validation of synsets was not possible.
• Features to search synsets based on do-
main, date, category was not present.
And therefore the CSS Manager Tool was devel-
oped in order to overcome the above limitations.

3 Features of CSS Tool
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9810265">
CSS Manager Tool is a centralized tool meant
for effective creation and management of
synsets. The features supported currently by the
CSS Manager Tool are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997270454545454">
1. Synset Creation:
• Addition/updation/validation of synsets,
linking of two or more synsets with simi-
lar gloss across languages,
• Comments- Comments can be provided
in case of any issue in the synset content.
• Allows adding additional information
about the synset (images, documents,
links, etc.).
2. Interactive User Interface:
• The CSS Manager Tool is designed
keeping in mind the broadest range of
users and contexts of use.
• Supports both left-to-right and right-to-
left text rendition.
• Allows adjustment of the layout as per
direction in which content language is
written through a simple setting of a flag.
• Viewing various media added for clarity
on synsets, etc.
3. Security:
• The CSS Manager Tool stores infor-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.894739">
mation in a centralized database system
where access control mechanisms can
more easily restrict access to your con-
tent.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998413611111111">
• User Management supports adding/
blocking/ unblocking users, and assigns
privileges to the users.
4. Use of RBAC approach
• Role-based access control (RBAC) is an
approach to restricting system access to
authorized users.
• Roles are created for various functions.
The permissions to perform certain oper-
ations are assigned to specific roles.
• Members or staff are assigned particular
roles, and through those role assignments
acquire the permissions to perform par-
ticular functions.
• Roles can be easily created, changed, or
discontinued as the needs evolve, with-
out having to individually update the
privileges for every user.

4 Architecture of CSS Tool
</note>
<figureCaption confidence="0.949856">
Figure 1 represents the architecture of CSS Man-
ager Tool. The CSS Manager Tool is implement-
ed in three blocks: User block, Super Admin
block, and the Database. The CSS Manager tool
is developed using the Hierarchical Role Based
system with Access Control (RBAC) to control
the access to certain parts and features of the
CSS Manager Tool across different users. Refer
Figure 2 for the block diagram of RBAC.
Figure1: Architecture of CSS Manager Tool
</figureCaption>
<listItem confidence="0.999335090909091">
• The User block is responsible for crea-
tion/updation/validation of synsets, link-
ing of synsets across languages, adding
comments, source, and domain.
• The Super-Admin block is responsible
for the creation of groups, users, roles to
be assigned to the members in a group,
modules and its operations, etc.
• The heart of the CSS Manager Tool is a
centralized database that stores all the
CSS data.
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998907">
4.1 Modules of CSS Manager Tool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997901266666666">
A module is an independent component which
offers specific functionality. Each module is as-
signed different operations related to the module.
The different operations are: Advance search,
add/view/edit/delete/link synsets, and add/delete/
change priority of example, add source, up-
load/delete file/add/view/reply comments, etc.
Only those operations that need to be performed
by members of a language group are assigned to
the modules and these modules are allotted to the
roles. These modules depend on CSS database.
While the addition of new modules does not re-
quire any changes to the CSS database, new ta-
bles may need to be added to store data specific
to module functionality.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.956455142857143">
Presently there are five modules, they are:
1. View All Synset: The view synset mod-
ule allows the linguist to view synsets
belonging to a language group/ category/
domain/source. The linguist/ lexicogra-
pher can perform the operations which
are assigned for this module.
2. Synset Creation: Allows the linguist to
create synsets. The linguist/ lexicogra-
pher can also add source/domain/images/
documents/links in order to give addi-
tional information about the synset.
3. View Linked Synset: Allows the lin-
guist to view the list of synsets linked
across languages.
4. User Management: Allows the adminis-
trator of a group to create new users, to
block/unblock user, to assign privileges
to the users, etc.
5. Synset Validation: Allows validation of
synsets.

4.2 Role-Based system used in CSS Manag-
er Tool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994731714285714">
A role hierarchy is a way of organizing roles to
reflect authority, responsibility, and competency.
Some general operations may be performed by
all the group members such as adding, viewing,
searching synsets. In this situation, it would be
inefficient and administratively cumbersome to
specify repeatedly these general operations for
each role that gets created. Therefore role hierar-
chy is used in order to avoid repetitive tasks. Al-
so when a user is associated with a role, the user
can be given additional privileges.
Currently, the CSS Manager Tool has four roles:
Super admin, Admin, senior linguist and junior
linguist.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995291428571428">
• The super admin is responsible for crea-
tion of groups, users of a group, creation
of roles to be assigned to the members in
a group, addition of new modules and
operations, and various other administra-
tive operations such as adding source,
domain, etc. which other roles cannot
perform.
Figure2: Role Based system with Access Control
• The Admin is responsible for managing
his/her language group created by the
Super admin. The admin of a group can
add/block users to his group. And can
use all the modules which are assigned
to the Admin by the Superadmin.
• The linguists are part of a language
group. The operations (such as creating/
validating/ linking of synsets) performed
by the junior linguists are further vali-
dated and approved by the senior lin-
guists of the group.

5 Implementation Details
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999653636363636">
The CSS Manager Tool is developed using PHP
scripting language and is hosted on a Web Server
supporting PHP version 5.3.15. Currently
MySQL version 5.5.21 is used as database. The
CSS Manager Tool was developed using
XAMPP on 32 bit Microsoft Windows platform.
It has been deployed on Fedora 16 Linux Plat-
form using Apache version 2.2.22 and MySQL
version 5.5.21 which come bundled with Fedora
16 Linux Platform. The screenshots of the tool
are shown at the end of the paper.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9977155">
The advantages of CSS Manager Tool can be
summarized as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997425875">
• Ease in accessing synsets: The synset is
represented by an identification number
called as synset id. Remembering id’s is
difficult for user, than remembering the
concept of the synset. Earlier, the lin-
guists had to remember synset id in order
to perform any operation on synset in fu-
ture. In CSS Manager Tool, the user
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8944035">
need not remember the synset ids, all the
operations can be performed with the
help of concept and synonymous set of
the words.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.633807">
• Decentralized maintenance: Need of
specialized software or any specific kind
of technological environment to access
the tool is not required. Any browser de-
vice connected to the Internet would be
sufficient for the job.
• WordNet Enhancement: Creation of
language specific concepts/synsets, add-
ing additional information about the syn-
set and their linkages to other Indian
language WordNets is possible. The tool
is being enhanced to support validation
of WordNets.

2. SuperAdmin: The super admin is the highest role in the role hierarchy. The super admin
owns all the privileges which the admin, linguist or lexicographer have. The super admin is
accountable for creation of groups, users of a group, creation of roles to be assigned to the
members in a group, addition of new modules and operations, and various other administrative
operations such as adding source, domain, etc. which other roles cannot perform. The snap-
shot of the super admin interface is shown below.
3. User Management: This module allows the administrator to view the users in a group, to add

new users, to block or unblock user, to assign privileges to the users, etc. The User Manage-
ment module is only available to the administrator of the group and not the linguist/ lexicog-
rapher.
To add a new User,
The Modules which are available to the linguist and lexicographers are as follows:
 Create Synset: This module allows the user to create a new synset.
 View All Synset: This module allows the user to view all the synsets created so far. On
selecting ‘View All Synset’ menu link, the user can view synsets belonging to a language.
It also allows the user to select the number of synsets to be displayed per page, to view
synsets based on the date of creation. Each module provides the user with the help files to
assist in tool usage.
The ‘Advance search’ option allows the user to view synsets belonging to a particular
grammatical category i.e Noun, Verb, Adverb, Adjective, a domain, a source and also to
view the synsets created by a user of a group.
Based on the operations assigned to the modules and roles, the user can edit, view or validate the
synsets.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9229196">
• View Linked Synsets: This module is similar to the View All synset module, but it only
allows the users to view the synsets which are linked across languages.
• Change Password: This module allows the user to change the password.
 Log Out: To log out from the CSS Manager Tool, the user needs to click on ‘Log Out’
from the menu list.

The CSS Manager Tool is implemented in three blocks: User block, Super Admin block, and the Database. The CSS Manager tool is developed using the Hierarchical Role Based system with Access Control (RBAC) to control the access to certain parts and features of the CSS Manager Tool across different users. Refer Figure 2 for the block diagram of RBAC. Figure1: Architecture of CSS Manager Tool • The User block is responsible for creation/updation/validation of synsets, linking of synsets across languages, adding comments, source, and domain. • The Super-Admin block is responsible for the creation of groups, users, roles to be assigned to the members in a group, modules and its operations, etc. • The heart of the CSS Manager Tool is a centralized database that stores all the CSS data. 4.1 Modules of CSS Manager Tool A module is an independent component which specific functionality. module is assigned different operations related to the module. The different operations are: Advance search, add/view/edit/delete/link synsets, and add/delete/ change priority of example, add source, upload/delete file/add/view/reply comments, etc. Only those operations that need to be performed by members of a language group are assigned to the modules and these modules are allotted to the roles. These modules depend on CSS database. While the addition of new modules does not reany changes to the CSS database, new tables may need to be added to store data specific to module functionality. Presently there are five modules, they are: View All Synset: view synset module allows the linguist to view synsets belonging to a language group/ category/ domain/source. The linguist/ lexicographer can perform the operations which are assigned for this module. Synset Creation: the linguist to create synsets. The linguist/ lexicographer can also add source/domain/images/ documents/links in order to give additional information about the synset. View Linked Synset: the linguist to view the list of synsets linked across languages. User Management: the administrator of a group to create new users, to block/unblock user, to assign privileges to the users, etc. Synset Validation: validation of synsets. 4.2 Role-Based system used in CSS Manager Tool A role hierarchy is a way of organizing roles to reflect authority, responsibility, and competency.

In this situation, it would be inefficient and administratively cumbersome to specify repeatedly these general operations for each role that gets created. Therefore role hierarchy is used in order to avoid repetitive tasks. Also when a user is associated with a role, the user can be given additional privileges. Currently, the CSS Manager Tool has four roles: Super admin, Admin, senior linguist and junior linguist. • The super admin is responsible for creation of groups, users of a group, creation of roles to be assigned to the members in a group, addition of new modules and operations, and various other administrative operations such as adding source, domain, etc. which other roles cannot perform. Figure2: Role Based system with Access Control • The Admin is responsible for managing his/her language group created by the Super admin. The admin of a group can add/block users to his group. And can use all the modules which are assigned to the Admin by the Superadmin. • The linguists are part of a language group. The operations (such as creating/ validating/ linking of synsets) performed by the junior linguists are further validated and approved by the senior linguists of the group. 5 Implementation Details The CSS Manager Tool is developed using PHP scripting language and is hosted on a Web Server supporting PHP version 5.3.15. Currently MySQL version 5.5.21 is used as database. The CSS Manager Tool was developed using XAMPP on 32 bit Microsoft Windows platform. It has been deployed on Fedora 16 Linux Platform using Apache version 2.2.22 and MySQL version 5.5.21 which come bundled with Fedora 16 Linux Platform. The screenshots of the tool are shown at the end of the paper. 6 Conclusion and Future Work The advantages of CSS Manager Tool can be summarized as follows: Ease in accessing synsets: synset is represented by an identification number as synset id. id’s is difficult for user, than remembering the concept of the synset. Earlier, the linguists had to remember synset id in order to perform any operation on synset in future. In CSS Manager Tool, the user need not remember the synset ids, all the operations can be performed with the help of concept and synonymous set of the words. Decentralized maintenance: of specialized software or any specific kind of technological environment to access the tool is not required. Any browser device connected to the Internet would be sufficient for the job. WordNet Enhancement: of language specific concepts/synsets, adding additional information about the synset and their linkages to other Indian language WordNets is possible. The tool is being enhanced to support validation of WordNets.

Consumers increasingly inform their purchase de-
cisions with opinions and other information found
on the Web. Unfortunately, the ease of posting
content online, potentially anonymously, com-
bined with the public&apos;s trust and growing reliance
on this content, creates opportunities and incen-
tives for abuse. This is especially worrisome in the
case of online reviews of products and services,
where businesses may feel pressure to post decep-
tive opinion spam---fictitious reviews disguised to
look like authentic customer reviews.
In recent years, several approaches have been pro-
posed to identify deceptive opinion spam based on
linguistic cues in a review&apos;s text. In this talk I will
summarize a few of these approaches. I will addi-
tionally discuss some of the challenges research-
ers face when studying this problem, including the
difficulty of obtaining labeled data, uncertainties
surrounding the prevalence of deception, and how
linguistic cues to deceptive opinion spam vary
with the text&apos;s sentiment (e.g., 5-star vs 1- and 2-
star reviews), domain (e.g., hotel vs. restaurant re-
views) and the domain expertise of the author
(e.g., crowdsourced vs. employee-written decep-
tive opinion spam).

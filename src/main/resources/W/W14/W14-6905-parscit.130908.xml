This survey describes recent works in
the field of Emotion Detection from text,
being a part of the broader area of Affective
Computing. This survey has been inspired
on the well-known fact that, despite there is
a lot of work on emotional detection
systems, a lot of work is expected to be
done yet. The increment of these systems is
due to the large amount of emotional data
available in Social Web. Detecting
emotions from text have attracted the
attention of many researchers in
computational linguistics because it has a
wide range of applications, such as suicide
prevention or measuring well-being of a
community. This paper mainly collects
works based on lexical and machine
learning approaches and these works are
classificated in accordance with the
emotional model and the approach used.

This survey describes recent works in the
field of emotion or affect detection from
text. Emotion detection is part of the
broader area of Affective Computing with
aims to enable computers recognize and
express emotions [Picard 1997]. Current
affect detection systems are with respect to
individual modalities or channels, such as
face, voice and text [Calvo 2010]. In this
survey, we have focused on reviewing
works about emotion detection from text.
Emotion detection and analysis has
been widely researched in neuroscience,
psychology and behavior science, as they
are an important element of human nature.
In computer science, this task has also
attracted the attention of many researchers,
especially in the field of human computer
interactions [Strapparava 2008].
In computational linguistics, the
detection of emotion states of a person by
analyzing a text document written by
him/her can have many applications in
different fields, such as in e-learning
environment [Rodriguez 2012] or suicide
prevention [Desmet 2013, Vaassen 2014].
For this reason, we decided to develop a
survey about emotion detection systems
from text and make it available to
researcher community.
In this survey, we classify the most
relevant emotion detection works in
accordance with the emotional model and
the approach used. A numerical comparison
is not possible since each work used
different data sets to evaluate their systems.
Regarding the search strategy used in
the survey, we have looked for all of papers
related to emotion detection from text in
different research databases like Scopus1 or
IEEE Xplore2. Later on, we have reviewed
the papers obtained of these databases and
have selected the best papers that use
lexical approach or machine learning
approach in their emotion detection
systems. The selection criterion used is
based on the relevance of each work in the
field of Affective Computing.
This paper is organized as follows. In
section 2, describes the emotional models.
Section 3, the different computational

approaches for emotion detection is

our conclusions about this survey.

When emotional detection systems are
analyzed, it is important to focus our
interest on describing and explaining how
the emotion models are established, as they
are, the basis of these systems.
According to research in psychology,
there is a number of theories about how to
represent emotions [Cowie 2003] but two
are the most important and the most often
used in existing approaches in Sentiment
Analysis [Francisco 2013]: emotional
categories and emotional dimensions.
Emotional categories approaches are
focused on model emotions based on
distinct emotion classes or labels. The
categorical model assumes that there are
discrete emotion categories. The Ekman’s
basic emotion model is within this
approach. [Ekman 1999] concluded that the
six basic emotions are ANGER,
DISGUST, FEAR, HAPPINESS,
SADNESS and SURPRISE. [Plutchik
1980] define a set of eight basic bipolar
emotions, consisting of a superset of
Ekman’s and with two additions: TRUST
and ANTICIPATION. These eight
emotions are organized into four bipolar
sets: joy vs. sadness, anger vs. fear, trust vs.
disgust, and surprise vs. anticipation.
Emotional dimensions approaches
represent affects in a dimensional form.
Each emotion occupies a location in this
space [Kim 2011]. One of the more
representative model of these approaches is
[Russell 1980]. Rusell’s Circumplex Model
of Affect suggests that emotions are
distributed in a two-dimensional circular
space: valence dimension and arousal
dimension, as show Figure 1. The valence
dimension indicates how much PLEASANT
and UNPLEASANT is an emotion. The
arousal dimension differentiates
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.956805" genericHeader="method">
ACTIVATION and DEACTIVATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999465133333333">
states. In this approach, we also find the
Mehrabian’s model, a model based on a
three-dimensional PAD (Pleasure – Arousal
- Dominance) representation [Mehrabian
1996]. The dominance dimension indicates
whether the subject feels in control of the
situation or not.
Although existing emotional categories
and emotional dimensions for representing
affective states, categorical approaches are
the most commonly used [Calvo 2013], as
we can check out in next section. Most of
computational approaches are based on
emotional categories, due to its simplicity
and familiarity. Nevertheless, emotional
categories may not cover all emotions
adequately because emotion categories are
limited. This is a major benefit of emotional
dimensional models. They are not
correlated to a certain emotional state and
are able to capture subtle emotion concepts
that differ only slightly. In addition, a
dimensional emotion model provides a
means for measuring similarity between
affective states [Kim 2011].
As we can observe, there are not an
emotion model better than other. Both
models have advantages and disadvantages.
The election of an emotion model depends
on the set of emotions that we want detect.

3 Computational approaches for
emotion detection

<bodyText confidence="0.999747142857143">
Emotion detection techniques can be
divided into lexicon based approaches and
machine learning approaches. On the one
hand, lexicon based approaches rely on
lexical resources such as lexicons, bags of
words or ontologies. On the other hand,
Machine Learning (ML) approaches apply

3.1 Lexicon-based approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863573770492">
Lexicon based approaches are approaches
that only use one or several lexical
resources to detect emotions detection.
Among these approaches, we can find
keyword-based approaches that are based
on predetermining a set of terms to classify
the text into emotion categories. In
[Strapparava 2008], as a baseline, they
implemented a simple algorithm that
checked the presence of affective words in
the headlines, and computed a score that
reflected the frequency of the words in this
affective lexicon in the text. They used
WordNet-Affect [Strapparava 2004].
Also among Lexicon based approaches,
we find the ontology-based ones. [Balahur
2011] use EmotiNet - a resource for the
detection of emotion from text based on
commonsense knowledge on concepts, their
interaction and their affective consequence
– to detect emotion. EmotiNet models
situations as chains of actions and their
corresponding emotional effect using an
ontological representation. Their evaluation
consists in testing if by employing the
model they build and the knowledge
contained in the core of EmotiNet, they are
able to detect the emotion expressed in new
examples pertaining to the categories in
International Survey of Emotional
Antecedents and Reactions (ISEAR),
through computing the similarity between
the emotion chain of the new situation and
the EmotiNet emotion chains. Their
evaluation shows that the structure and
content of EmotiNet are appropriate to
address the automatic treatment of
implicitly expressed affect. [Sykora 2013]
also use an ontology approach to solve the
problem of fine-grained emotion detection
in text. Their approach detects a range of
eight high-level emotions; anger, confusion,
disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, shame and
surprise.
Statistical approach is also considered
as a Lexical approach. Most
knowledge-based works use Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA), a statistical
approach for analyzing the relationships
between a set of documents and the terms
mentioned in these documents in order to
produce a set of meaningful patterns related
to the documents and terms [Deerwester
1999]. [Gill 2008] used LSA and the
Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL)
to automatically compute the semantic
similarity between the texts and emotions
keywords. Recently, [Wang 2013] propose
a method that uses an improved LSA
algorithm for text emotion classification on
ISEAR dataset.

3.2 Machine Learning-based
approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999666363636364">
Machine learning is a scientific discipline
that deals with the construction and study of
algorithms that can learn from data [Kovahi
1998]. Such algorithms operate by building
a model based on inputs and using these
inputs to make predictions or decisions,
rather than following only explicitly
programmed instructions [Bishop 2006].
Specifically in emotion detection,
Machine learning algorithms are used to
learn how detect emotions. These
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993538">

<bodyText confidence="0.999118847826087">
approaches can be divided into supervised
and unsupervised learning.
Supervised learning approaches rely on
a labelled training data, a set of training
examples. The supervised learning
algorithm analyses the training data and
infers a function, which we use for mapping
new examples [Mohri 2012].
A labelled corpus is a large and
structured set of text that it is necessary
annotated with emotional tags. In this case,
the annotation process is considered as one
of their most important disadvantages as it
becomes a tedious and time-consuming
task. However, there are recent works
related with emotion detection in Twitter
messages, where the training examples are
automatically labelled through hashtags and
emoticons contained. [Hasan 2014, Wang
2012, Roberts 2012, Suttles 2013] among
others, are proposals that use this method
for labeling training data automatically.
Moreover, [Hasan 2014a] confirms that
hashtags are indeed good emotion labels.
Concerning works that apply supervised
learning algorithms, we can find both the
categorical and the dimensional approaches
to base their emotional models. Categorical
approaches are the most commonly used in
emotion detection [Calvo 2013]. One of the
first works based in this model is [Alm
2005]. This proposal presented an empirical
study of applying supervised machine
learning with the SNoW learning
architecture [Roth 1999]. They used an
annotated corpus with an extended set of
Ekman basic emotions. [Strapparava 2008],
in one of the experiment presented in their
work, applied Naïve Bayes classifier
trained on the blog entries from
LiveJournal.com 3. They used a collection
of blogposts annotated with Ekman’s
emotions. More recently, [Balabantaray
2012] presents an Emotion classifier that is
able to determinate the emotion class of the
person writing. Their emotion classifier is
</bodyText>

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999637395833333">
based on multi-class SVM kernels and
takes decisions according to the basic
emotions identified by Ekman [Ekman
1999]. [Roberts 2012] also use the Ekman’s
six basic emotions and include LOVE
emotion. Their system uses a series of
binary SVM classifiers to detect each of the
seven emotions. Other related work with
categorical emotion models, [Suttles 2013]
classify emotions according to a set of eight
basic bipolar emotions defined by
Plutchick. This allows them to treat the
multi-class problem of emotion
classification as a binary problem for
opposing emotion pairs. Their approach
applies Distant Supervision [Mintz 2009].
About works that apply supervised
learning approach and use dimensional
emotion model, we can find the work of
[Hasan 2014], where they propose an
approach for automatically classifying text
messages of individual to infer their
emotional states. They use the Rusell’s
Circumplex Model of Affect as emotion
model and train supervised classifiers to
detect multiple emotion. Specifically, they
have compared the accuracy of SVM,
KNN, Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes for
classifying Twitter messages.
Regarding unsupervised learning
approaches, these algorithms try to find
hidden structure in unlabeled data in order
to build models for emotion classification
[Mohri 2012].
As occurs in supervised learning,
among unsupervised learning proposals
also it can be found systems based on
categorical and dimensional emotion
models.
With respect to works based in
categorical emotion model, [Strapparava
2008] apply unsupervised techniques
combining LSA with WordNet Affect
[Strapparava 2004]. This proposal used the
Ekman’s basic emotions. [Agrawal 2012]
proposes a novel unsupervised
context-based approach based on a
methodology that does not depend on any

existing affect lexicon, thereby their model
is flexible enough to classify sentences
beyond Ekman’s model of six basic
emotions. [Calvo 2013] presents different
categorical approaches based on Vector
Space Model (VSM) with three
dimensionality reduction techniques: Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic
Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
This work conclude that NMF-based
categorical classification performs the best
among categorical approaches to
classification.
About unsupervised approach with
dimensional emotion model, we find [Calvo
2013]. This work used a normative database
ANEW [Bradley 1999] to produce
tree-dimensional vectors (valence, arousal,
dominance) for each pseudo-document.
The articles presented in this survey are
summarized in Table 1.

4 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910764705882">
In this survey, we have started discussing
the emotion models defined by
psychologies because it is the base of
emotion detection. As concluding by
[Calvo 2013] and we have check out,
categorical approach is the model more
used in emotion detection systems.
Regarding Lexical approaches,
keyword-based approaches are easily
implementable and we can obtain good
accuracy values, even though this approach
has drawbacks: determining the content of
the emotion lexicon is subjective, obtaining
wrong recall values and the select words
may be ambiguous [Suttles 2013].
Moreover, it is not suitable for wide range
of domains.
With respect to approaches based on
ontologies let us use commonsense
knowledge and improve recall values but
the creation of an emotional ontology is a
tedious and time-consuming task.
Consequently, lexical resources usually
are used as features in Machine Learning
algorithms.
As for Machine Learning approaches,
the supervised learning approach is more
used in emotion detection because it usually
leads to better results than unsupervised
learning [Kim 2011]. Although, these
approaches need labelling training
examples and annotating of examples,
which is a time-consuming task. For this
reason, several researches have analyzed as

realize this task automatically and when our
system process Twitter messages, the
messages can be annotated through
hashtags or emotions that it contains.
Although unsupervised learning
approach leads worse results than
supervised learning, it can be a good
election for the emotion detection task
because the emotional interpretations of a
text can be highly subjective and the
annotation task is an error prone task [Kim
2011].
In conclusion, Machine Learning
approaches are better option for detection
emotion task since we obtain a model is
also able to detect emotions in texts that
have only an indirect reference to an
emotions. Although, it is important use a
good lexical resource as features in
Machine Learning algorithms to obtain
good results.
Concerning pending tasks in emotion
detection field, we consider really
important that researcher community
establish an annotated corpus and a set of
metrics that it may be used to evaluate the
different existing systems and the future
systems. Moreover, in emotional detection
systems based on machine learning
approach, we have detected that most of
these systems use features based on a
shallow analysis on the text as: n-grams,
punctuation, emoticons or Part-Of-Speech.
Hence, we propose a new direction focuses
on deep analysis, since we consider that if
we use features based on a deep analysis on
the text we could improve the emotional
detection systems.

Recently, [Wang 2013] propose a method that uses an improved LSA algorithm for text emotion classification on ISEAR dataset. 3.2 Machine Learning-based approaches Machine learning is a scientific discipline that deals with the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data [Kovahi 1998]. Such algorithms operate by building a model based on inputs and using these inputs to make predictions or decisions, rather than following only explicitly programmed instructions [Bishop 2006]. Specifically in emotion detection, Machine learning algorithms are used to learn how detect emotions. These 3 approaches can be divided into supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning approaches rely on a labelled training data, a set of training examples. The supervised learning algorithm analyses the training data and infers a function, which we use for mapping new examples [Mohri 2012]. A labelled corpus is a large and structured set of text that it is necessary annotated with emotional tags. In this case, the annotation process is considered as one of their most important</context>

According to research in psychology, there is a number of theories about how to represent emotions [Cowie 2003] but two are the most important and the most often used in existing approaches in Sentiment Analysis [Francisco 2013]: emotional categories and emotional dimensions. Emotional categories approaches are focused on model emotions based on distinct emotion classes or labels. The categorical model assumes that there are discrete emotion categories. The Ekman’s basic emotion model is within this approach. [Ekman 1999] concluded that the six basic emotions are ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR, HAPPINESS, SADNESS and SURPRISE. [Plutchik 1980] define a set of eight basic bipolar emotions, consisting of a superset of Ekman’s and with two additions: TRUST and ANTICIPATION. These eight emotions are organized into four bipolar sets: joy vs. sadness, anger vs. fear, trust vs. disgust, and surprise vs. anticipation. Emotional dimensions approaches represent affects in a dimensional form. Each emotion occupies a location in this space [Kim 2011]. One of the more representative model of these approaches is [Russell 1980]. Rusel</context>

[Strapparava 2008], in one of the experiment presented in their work, applied Naïve Bayes classifier trained on the blog entries from LiveJournal.com 3. They used a collection of blogposts annotated with Ekman’s emotions. More recently, [Balabantaray 2012] presents an Emotion classifier that is able to determinate the emotion class of the person writing. Their emotion classifier is 3 http://www.livejournal.com/ based on multi-class SVM kernels and takes decisions according to the basic emotions identified by Ekman [Ekman 1999]. [Roberts 2012] also use the Ekman’s six basic emotions and include LOVE emotion. Their system uses a series of binary SVM classifiers to detect each of the seven emotions. Other related work with categorical emotion models, [Suttles 2013] classify emotions according to a set of eight basic bipolar emotions defined by Plutchick. This allows them to treat the multi-class problem of emotion classification as a binary problem for opposing emotion pairs. Their approach applies Distant Supervision [Mintz 2009].

Most of computational approaches are based on emotional categories, due to its simplicity and familiarity. Nevertheless, emotional categories may not cover all emotions adequately because emotion categories are limited. This is a major benefit of emotional dimensional models. They are not correlated to a certain emotional state and are able to capture subtle emotion concepts that differ only slightly. In addition, a dimensional emotion model provides a means for measuring similarity between affective states [Kim 2011]. As we can observe, there are not an emotion model better than other. Both models have advantages and disadvantages. The election of an emotion model depends on the set of emotions that we want detect. 3 Computational approaches for emotion detection Emotion detection techniques can be divided into lexicon based approaches and machine learning approaches. On the one hand, lexicon based approaches rely on lexical resources such as lexicons, bags of words or ontologies. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) approaches apply 2 ML algorithms based on linguistic features. Figure 1: Graphical r</context>

Moreover, it is not suitable for wide range of domains. With respect to approaches based on ontologies let us use commonsense knowledge and improve recall values but the creation of an emotional ontology is a tedious and time-consuming task. Consequently, lexical resources usually are used as features in Machine Learning algorithms. As for Machine Learning approaches, the supervised learning approach is more used in emotion detection because it usually leads to better results than unsupervised learning [Kim 2011]. Although, these approaches need labelling training examples and annotating of examples, which is a time-consuming task. For this reason, several researches have analyzed as 5 Table 1: Emotion Detection approaches realize this task automatically and when our system process Twitter messages, the messages can be annotated through hashtags or emotions that it contains. Although unsupervised learning approach leads worse results than supervised learning, it can be a good election for the emotion detection task because the emotional interpretations of a text can be highly subjective and the annot</context>

Emotion detection is part of the broader area of Affective Computing with aims to enable computers recognize and express emotions [Picard 1997]. Current affect detection systems are with respect to individual modalities or channels, such as face, voice and text [Calvo 2010].

This paper reports the preliminary results of re-
search by the Research Laboratory for Law, Log-
ic &amp; Technology (LLT Lab) on a corpus of judi-
cial decisions that we have annotated for patterns
of argumentation. We first describe the sample of
judicial decisions, and report the frequency of
argument types using a coarse typology based on
logical connectives. We then discuss three addi-
tional approaches to a finer-grained typology,
based on types of inference, types of evidence,
and types of evidentiary discrepancies. We con-
clude by discussing our working hypotheses for
developing a type system for arguments, as well
as discussing prior related work.

2 The Sample of Vaccine-Injury Com-

The research in this paper is based on a sample
of 10 judicial decisions in the United States, in
which the petitioner was seeking compensation,
under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation
Program (NVICP), for injuries allegedly caused
by a covered vaccine (Ashley and Walker 2013;
Walker 2009; Walker et al. 2011, 2013). The
sample is part of the Vaccine/Injury Project Cor-
pus (V/IP Corpus), which comprises every deci-
sion filed during a 2-year period (a total of 35
decision texts, typically 15 to 40 pages each) that
applied a 3-prong test of causation, enunciated
by a federal court in Althen (2005). These deci-
sions are authored by special masters attached to
the Court of Federal Claims, who function as
factfinders in contested cases. According to the

Automated argumentation mining re-
quires an adequate type system or anno-
tation scheme for classifying the patterns
of argument that succeed or fail in a cor-
pus of legal documents. Moreover, there
must be a reliable and accurate method
for classifying the arguments found in
natural language legal documents. With-
out an adequate and operational type sys-
tem, we are unlikely to reach consensus
on argument corpora that can function as
a gold standard. This paper reports the
preliminary results of research to anno-
tate a sample of representative judicial
decisions for the reasoning of the fact-
finder. The decisions report whether the
evidence adduced by the petitioner ade-
quately supports the claim that a medical
theory causally links some type of vac-
cine with various types of injuries or ad-
verse medical conditions. This paper
summarizes and discusses some patterns
of reasoning that we are finding, using
examples from the corpus. The pattern
types and examples presented here
demonstrate the difficulty of developing
a type or annotation system for character-
izing the logically important patterns of
reasoning.

Althen test, in order to prevail the petitioner must
establish three propositions, each by a prepon-
derance of the evidence: (1) that a “medical theo-
ry causally connects” the type of vaccine with
the type of injury; (2) that there was a “logical
sequence of cause and effect” between the par-
ticular vaccination and the particular injury; and
(3) that a “proximate temporal relationship” ex-
isted between the vaccination and the injury.
Proving these causation conditions generally re-
quires integrating expert, scientific evidence with
non-expert evidence, and reconciling scientific
standards of proof with non-scientific (legal or
common-sense) standards of proof. In 5 of the
decisions, the petitioner succeeded in proving all
three Althen conditions and ultimately won the
case (Cusati, Roper, Casey, Werderitsh, and
Stewart), while in the remaining 5 cases the peti-
tioner lost on the Althen first condition and the
government won the case (Meyers, Sawyer,
Wolfe, Thomas, and Walton).
This paper examines patterns of argument and
reasoning found in the factfinding portions of
these vaccine-compensation cases. And we have
examined primarily the patterns of reasoning
provided by the factfinder in support of the find-
ings of fact. There are several reasons for taking
this approach. First, focusing on the reported
findings and reasoning of the factfinder also pro-
vides information about which arguments were
successful (persuasive) and which were not. Se-
cond, in writing a decision, the factfinder is more
likely to report her own reasoning with more care
and detail than she might use in relating the ar-
gument of a witness or party. Third, in probably
many situations, the reasoning reported by a fact-
finder was in fact also an argument made origi-
nally by a party, which was then adopted by the
factfinder. Fourth, in most decisions it is easier to
identify and count all of the reported findings
and reasons of the factfinder, because they are
often gathered together in a “Discussion” section
of the decision; by contrast, counting the total
number of arguments of the parties is more diffi-
cult.
Moreover, we have limited ourselves in this
paper primarily to patterns that address the first
of these Althen conditions: that is, whether there
was at the time of the litigation a medical theory
that causally linked the type of vaccine involved
with the type of injury alleged. We have selected
this issue for this paper because it involves an
issue and style of proof that is general in nature,
and less dependent upon the plausibility of par-
ticular facts that are peculiar to the specific case.
Indeed, proving that “the vaccine can cause this
type of injury, at least sometimes” is likely to
exhibit patterns of reasoning common in many
domains, both inside and outside of law.
In general, we expect both the arguments by
the parties or witnesses and the reasoning given
by the factfinder for a finding of fact to exhibit
the same “argument patterns.” That is, we expect
the same types of patterns to occur, whether a
party puts forth an argument for the factfinder to
adopt, or the factfinder reports certain reasoning
as being persuasive. As a matter of terminology,
the term “argument” is typically applied to the
argumentative reasoning of a party, whether or
not it proves to be persuasive to the factfinder,
and the term “reasoning” is often reserved for the
supporting reasoning provided by the legal deci-
sion maker. However, from the perspective of
exhibiting reasoning patterns, we consider “ar-
guments” and “reasoning” to be equivalent – the
only difference being attribution (the agent using
the pattern, or to whom the pattern is attributed).

In order to provide quality assurance in identi-
fying the structure of the factfinder’s reasoning,
our methodology integrated analyses by three
annotators in three steps. First, a student re-
searcher trained in the LLT Lab’s logic modeling
protocols annotated a legal decision for elements
of the factfinder’s reasoning. Second, another
student (who was usually more experienced than
the first student) then reviewed those annota-
tions, and the two researchers reached a consen-
sus on any discrepancies. Third, Lab Director
Walker performed an independent analysis, and
he and the two student researchers discussed and
documented any annotation issues, and decided
on the final annotations. The resulting “logic
model” of the reasoning for a single case inte-
grates numerous units of reasoning into a single
logical structure, with each unit consisting of one
conclusion and one or more immediately sup-
porting reasons (premises).
Walker et al. (2011, pp. 296-300) provide de-
tails on the default-logic framework and on the
logical connectives used in the LLT Lab’s logic
models to connect the supporting reasons (prem-
ises) to the conclusion. Because evidentiary
propositions (both conclusions and premises)
have plausibility-values based on a seven-valued
scale (from “highly plausible” through “undecid-
ed” to “highly implausible”), the logical connec-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.900704333333333">
tives must operate on a many-valued scale. The
four logical connectives we use in our logic
models are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998445304347826">
• “MIN” assigns to the conclusion the
lowest plausibility-value possessed by
any of its supporting premises (MIN
functions like a conjunctive AND);
• “MAX” assigns to the conclusion the
highest plausibility-value possessed by
any of its supporting premises (MAX
functions like a disjunctive OR);
• “EVIDENCE FACTORS” merely lists
relevant reasons or premises, but does
not provide a computable formula for
producing a plausibility-value for the
conclusion as a function of the values of
the premises; and
• “REBUT” assigns to the conclusion a
degree of implausibility inverse to the
degree of plausibility of the rebutting
(defeating) premise, when (but only
when) the rebutting premise is plausible
to some degree (for example, if the re-
butting premise is “highly plausible,”
then the conclusion is “highly implausi-
ble”; but if the rebutting premise is only
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999439269230769">
“slightly plausible,” then the conclusion
is only “slightly implausible”).
Using the kind of logical connective employed
as a coarse typology, we can classify the argu-
ments found within the factfinding. Table 1
summarizes the results of the argument frequen-
cies within the LLT Lab’s logic models for the
10 decisions in the sample, under Althen Prong 1
only, by type of connective. A single argument is
defined as a single conclusion supported by an
immediate level of reasoning – that is, a single
conclusion supported by one or more premises or
reasons. Where a single conclusion rests on both
prima facie supporting premises and a defeater,
we classified that argument by the connective
occurring in the prima facie line of reasoning. In
Table 1, for example, the reasoning of the fact-
finder under Althen Prong 1 in the Roper deci-
sion consisted of 7 arguments containing the EV-
IDENCE FACTORS connective, 2 arguments
connected by MIN, and 1 argument connected by
REBUT. The numeral “1” in square brackets in
the REBUT column of Table 1 indicates that
there was a second REBUT connective in the
decision, but it occurred as a defeater attached to
some other prima facie line of reasoning.

<bodyText confidence="0.99998415">
An examination of the results in Table 1
shows one reason why we regard this classifica-
tion of arguments by logical connective as
providing only a high-level or coarse typology,
but not an adequately informative or useful ty-
pology. By far the most common form of argu-
ment stated is simply a conclusion, supported by
a list of relevant considerations (the arguments
containing simply the EVIDENCE FACTORS
connective). In these arguments, no other struc-
ture is expressly indicated, beyond a listing of
supporting reasons. Nearly 79% of the arguments
(56 out of 71) contained no internal truth-
functional structure, but were merely lists of
supporting information considered by the fact-
finder to be relevant to drawing that conclusion.
This provides motivation for developing a more
informative typology for arguments or reasoning
patterns, beyond the connectives normally used
in propositional logic.

However, we express a word of caution about
maintaining descriptive accuracy in annotation.
We have considered it critical to annotate pat-
terns of reasoning in a way that accurately repre-
sents the reported reasoning of the factfinder. If
there exists no semantic cue indicating a more
structured form than merely a list of supporting
reasons, then we believe that accurate annotation
would represent the list form of the original doc-
ument. It might be possible to interpret a list as a
more structured line of reasoning, but the data
themselves (as contrasted with the interpretation
of those data) should not be contaminated with
information not already expressed in the original
source. Thus, we believe that it should always be
possible to distinguish between annotations that
are strictly faithful to the text in representing the
author’s stated meaning, and annotations that add
the interpretations of commentators. The kind of
type system we are discussing in this paper is the
former kind, with which we can accurately cap-
ture the meaning of the author of the text.

4 Patterns by Types of Inference
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999936">
This section discusses the possible approach of
identifying patterns of argumentation or reason-
ing that exhibit some type of inference from
premises to conclusion (beyond the propositional
connectives discussed in Section 3). This ap-
proach would draw upon inference methods stud-
ied in fields other than law, such as deductive
logic, probability or statistics, science or medi-
cine. We discuss some of these types of infer-
ence that we find in the vaccine cases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995126">
4.1 Deductive Reasoning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997272">
Occasionally reasoning is deductive in form –
that is, if the premises are true then the conclu-
sion must be true as well, and the sole avenue for
undermining the argument is attacking the truth
of the premises (Copi and Cohen 1998, p. 25). In
such patterns, the supporting reasons are not
merely a list, but rather a list of jointly sufficient
reasons for drawing the inference as a necessary
conclusion. For example, in Casey (p. 26), the
conclusion that the varicella vaccine can nega-
tively affect the nervous system was supported
by a conjunction of two causal relations: that the
vaccine can cause a direct viral infection, and
that a direct viral infection can negatively affect
the nervous system.
Deductive patterns of reasoning, however,
would have premises connected to the conclusion
by the propositional connective MIN, because
the conclusion would be true (or plausible)
whenever all of the premises are true (plausible).
At most, therefore, 8 of the 71 arguments found
in the 10 sample cases would be deductive in
form. We find that it is extremely rare for the
factfinders in the vaccine cases to explicitly lay
out reasoning in a deductively valid format.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997635">
4.2 Probabilistic or Statistical Reasoning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997055555556">
Reasoning that is probabilistic or statistical in
form could be sub-divided into many types –
e.g., reasoning based on premises that are explic-
itly regarded as merely probable, or reasoning
proceeding from a premise that most (or some
percentage of) members of one class are mem-
bers of another class. For example, in Sawyer (p.
10), the petitioner’s expert relied on the generali-
zation that “it would be reasonable for someone
with [the petitioner’s] condition to have some
days that are less painful than others, but it
should generally be a constant pain.” And in
Walton (p. 33), when the petitioner’s expert ar-
gued that the MMR vaccine can cause myocardi-
tis, the government’s expert rebutted that if it
were possible, then “we would have seen it by
now because millions of doses of the vaccine
have been given and this has not been reported.”
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998938">
4.3 Scientific or Medical Reasoning
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939730769231">
While deductive and probabilistic inferences do
not rely upon methods developed within any par-
ticular discipline, legal factfinders are often per-
suaded by inference methods familiar from sci-
ence or medicine. For example, in Walton (p.
35), an expert for the petitioner and an expert for
the government agreed that “an acute reaction
from a vaccine-caused myocarditis would be ex-
pected to manifest within days to two weeks of
infection.” Yet the petitioner’s “symptoms oc-
curred well over three weeks after her vaccina-
tion.” The special master found that “[p]erhaps
the most significant problem” with the petition-
er’s theory of causation was “the lack of tem-
poral connection between the MMR vaccination
and evidence of a cardiac illness.”
Scientific, medical and other expert witnesses
sometimes reach a conclusion by balancing vari-
ous factors and arriving at a considered profes-
sional judgment, and this process itself might be
persuasive to the legal factfinder. For example,
the opinions of two medical experts that the spe-
cial master found credible in Stewart (pp. 36, 38)
were supported by lists of reasons. An expert’s
scientific argument may be presented in a way
that lends itself to a legal and logical structure,
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.98795">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999559375">
providing an expert judgment in weighing the
same evidence that the Special Master can rely
on in reaching a conclusion.
Sometimes the appeal to scientific reasoning is
mediated by evidence that scientists themselves
have already reached a conclusion on the issue.
In Meyers (p. 10), the special master noted that
the “scientific community has rejected [the ex-
pert’s] theories as detailed in his articles because
the human studies that have been conducted do
not support his conclusions and his analytical
methods do not comport with the Daubert re-
quirement of reliability.” Daubert was a decision
by the U.S. Supreme Court discussing factors
relevant to assessing the evidentiary reliability of
a scientific expert opinion in court.

5 Patterns by Types of Evidence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973">
This section discusses another approach to classi-
fying patterns of argument and reasoning, one
that is based upon the type of evidence in one or
more of the premises. The form of reasoning or
inference that relies on that evidence to arrive at
a conclusion can be varied (as discussed in Sec-
tion 4).
This section illustrates some of the types of
evidence we find recurring in vaccine cases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977844">
5.1 Legal Precedent as Basis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987294117647">
One of the most common patterns of legal rea-
soning involves the citation of prior legal deci-
sions as precedents. Precedent-based reasoning
occurs when judges or factfinders utilize prior
cases as providing a binding rule or applicable
principle, or as providing guidance by analogy to
explain or justify an outcome in the undecided
matter before them (Cross et al., 2010, pp. 490-
512; Levi 1949, pp. 8-27).
In vaccine decisions, the special masters have
utilized precedent-based reasoning in various
ways. In Wolfe (pp. 9-11), for example, the peti-
tioner’s expert based his theory of causation
solely on the temporal relationship between the
vaccination and the onset of the injury, together
with a lack of alternative theories of causation.
The special master found that argument to fall
short of the established burden, citing the Federal
Circuit’s decision in Grant (p. 1148) for the
proposition that mere temporal relationship and
lack of alternative causes is not enough to create
a prima facie case. In Werderitsh (p. 44), the
government challenged the petitioner’s prima
facie case by pointing to “the failure of valid ep-
idemiologic studies to show a relationship” and
“the absence of the knowledge of the appropriate
biologic mechanisms responsible.” The special
master countered that “[l]egally, the absence of
epidemiologic support for linking hepatitis B
vaccine and MS, and the lack of identification of
the specific biologic mechanism at work if hepa-
titis B vaccine causes MS do not prevent peti-
tioner from satisfying her burden of proof,” cit-
ing the Federal Circuit’s decision in Knudsen.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998981">
5.2 Legal Policy as Basis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988846153846">
Sometimes an important basis for the reasoning
is not merely a precedent, but an authoritatively
established legal policy that is considered opera-
tive. For example, in Casey (p. 26), the special
master decided that the petitioner “provided suf-
ficient proof of a medical theory of causation,”
and explained in part that “[i]t is precisely be-
cause individuals experience adverse reactions to
safe vaccines on rare occasions that Congress
created the Vaccine Program.” It is possible, for
example, that a weaker statistical inference (Sec-
tion 4.2) might combine with a policy objective
to produce a persuasive argument.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997383">
5.3 Medical or Scientific Studies as Basis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992411764706">
In vaccine decisions, it is often the case that ar-
guments are based upon medical or scientific
studies, either published in medical or scientific
journals or reported in medical treatises. For
example, in Stewart (pp. 38-39), the special mas-
ter relied in part on medical literature reporting a
connection between the hepatitis A virus and
cerebellar ataxia, in finding for the petitioner in a
case involving hepatitis A vaccine and the same
adverse medical condition. On the other hand, in
Meyers (pp. 12-14), the special master refused to
credit an expert opinion that was based on arti-
cles and reports that failed to address the relevant
vaccine or injuries in the case. And in Werderitsh
(p. 43), the special master was not persuaded by
an article whose authors admitted that their study
was small and its statistical power was reduced.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995466">
5.4 Case Reports as Basis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998992">
A case report is a descriptive study of a single
patient’s experience (Cetrulo 2013). Such anec-
dotal evidence is extremely weak evidence of
causation, due to the lack of a control group for
testing comparisons (Kaye et al., 2014). Howev-
er, despite their obvious statistical shortcomings,
case reports have been utilized by special masers
in their reasoning. In Roper (pp. 5-9), the special
master explicitly addressed the inability of case
reports to provide “scientific certainty” by noting
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.984996">
5
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995725">
that the petitioner’s burden is subject to a much
lower “more probable than not” standard, and
that accumulated circumstantial evidence of
probability can become sufficient to prove causa-
tion. In Stewart (p. 36), the special master found
the case report filed by the government to be rel-
evant for showing a plausible medical theory.
And in Werderitsh (p. 46), the special master was
convinced of causation in large part by the ex-
pert’s analogy with another vaccine case, and by
the similarity of the timing pattern of the relevant
symptoms in the two cases.

5.5 Fact Testimony as Basis

ny of a lay witness as an evidentiary basis, alt-

6 Patterns Based on Evidentiary Dis-
crepancies
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974086956522">
This section discusses a third approach to classi-
fying patterns of argumentation and reasoning,
one that is based on the insight that in law, per-
haps more than in other domains involving fact-
finding, cases are often decided primarily by re-
solving inconsistencies or discrepancies in the
evidence. When the parties or their expert wit-
nesses agree on a proposition, then the legal fact-
finder generally accepts that proposition as un-
contested fact, for purposes of the litigation. For
example, in Cusati (pp. 11-14), the opposing par-
ties’ experts agreed on the fact that the MMR
vaccine causes fever, and, in turn, that fever
causes seizures. The special master utilized that
consensus as part of the basis for concluding that
the petitioner had met the prima facie standard
with respect to causation. Similarly, in Casey (p.
26), all experts agreed that the temporal sequence
of petitioner’s symptoms was appropriate. The
special master deemed that consensus entirely
determinative as to the third condition of Althen
and did not even engage in further temporal
analysis.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99951">
6.1 Credibility of Source: Expert vs. Expert
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989260869565">
When opposing expert witnesses disagree on
some proposition or issue within their expertise,
then one approach of the decision maker is to
weigh the credibility of the experts, either indi-
vidually or in comparison. For example, in Saw-
yer (pp. 16-20), the special master found the ex-
pert to be so unreliable that this ultimately be-
came the main basis for the decision: “This is a
case of unreliable expert testimony.” The special
master devoted 41/2 pages of his single-spaced
decision to detailing his supporting reasoning. In
Stewart (pp. 41-42), the special master looked to
the lack of credibility of the government’s expert
in reaching a finding for the petitioner. The ex-
pert was found to be “less than candid or credi-
ble” due to an insistence on an assumption that
was directly contradicted by medical records,
and his failure to take videotape evidence suffi-
ciently into account. And in Walton (p. 35), the
special master discussed why she “found Dr.
Charash [the petitioner’s expert] to be far less
persuasive than Dr. Glezen or Dr. Brinker [ex-
perts for the government].”

ed upon that source’s taking irrelevant factors
into account, or failing to take relevant factors
into account. In Walton (p. 35), for example, the
petitioner’s expert “relied upon assertions of fact
not supported by contemporaneous medical rec-
ords, failed to address the significance of nega-
tive cardiac testing, relied upon a temporal rela-
tionship between vaccination and onset of symp-
toms not established by the evidence, failed to
demonstrate any support for his theories in re-
search, and failed to address the contrary re-
search evidence submitted by respondent’s ex-
perts.”

for Arguments

<bodyText confidence="0.999594052631579">
Our objective is to develop a type system for ar-
gument patterns using high-level categories such
as those illustrated in Sections 4-6, and develop-
ing sub-types based on lower-level categories.
The features of sub-categories that are important
are those that help to identify arguments that
were successful or unsuccessful in the vaccine
cases. For example, under the category of medi-
cal or scientific studies as basis (see Section 5.3
above), a sub-category might be studies that re-
port negative results (no evidence of a statistical-
ly significant causal relationship), and important
features might include sample size and statistical
power (see Werderitsh, p. 43). In developing a
type system, we have formulated several work-
ing hypotheses from the approaches and exam-
ples discussed above.
First, it might be difficult to construct a well-
defined taxonomy for types of argument patterns
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999992317073171">
in a specific legal domain. That is, it might not
be feasible to devise a classification system un-
der which every argument instance would fit in
one and only one category, even in principle. An
argument instance might well fit under multiple
categories. Moreover, this theoretical point is
quite separate from the difficulty of devising a
methodology for reliably and accurately placing
each argument instance into the correct category.
As a result, it might be more realistic to devel-
op a list of significant categories and features of
arguments, and to score a profile for any particu-
lar argument instance on those categories and
features. For example, an argument instance
might involve a combination of attacking the
credibility of a source through inadequate expla-
nation (Section 6.2), by relying on a scientific
study (Section 5.3) while employing probabilistic
reasoning (Seciton 4.2). Then, instead of an iden-
tity relation (two arguments being “the same
type”), a fuzzier relation of similarity might be
useful, computed as a function of the profile
scores of two argument instances.
Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that
the optimal list of argument categories and fea-
tures might be in part a function of the task to be
performed, and some a priori list might not be
optimal for all uses. This is an empirical question
that remains to be answered.
Third, if it proves to be the case that the opti-
mal list of argument categories and features is
both a function of the task to be performed and
widely variant from domain area to domain area,
then the most promising approach might be ma-
chine learning on training texts that have been
only lightly parsed in standard ways. That is, a
coarser-grained semantic markup (e.g., sentences
or clauses tagged merely as “evidence” and
“finding,” or “premise” and “conclusion”) might
be less costly to achieve, might have higher in-
ter-annotator reliability, and might be entirely
adequate for machine learning. In order to test
this hypothesis, however, we still need to devel-
op an adequate annotation scheme and a gold
standard corpus of argument patterns.
Finally, once an adequate annotation scheme
is developed, we will face the challenge of out-
come evaluation. Argument patterns may differ
in weight with respect to the overall conclusion
and ultimate outcome of the case. For example,
in the context of vaccine decisions, a finding that
petitioner’s expert was entirely unreliable may
singlehandedly support dismissal of the entire
claim (see Sawyer, pp. 16-20). In addition, it is
far from clear whether case reports alone can
support a medical theory connecting the vaccine
to the injury (see Roper, pp. 5-9; Stewart, p. 36).
Thus, comparative research and assignment of
weights to argument patterns may be useful.
In addition to keeping these working hypothe-
ses in mind, when deciding upon the tentative
adoption of any annotation scheme or type sys-
tem, we give consideration to: (1) the cost (in
terms of both resources and risk of error) of
manually applying the scheme to the number of
legal documents needed to allow machine train-
ing and testing; (2) the feasibility of successfully
automating the detection and annotation of new
texts using the scheme; (3) the adequacy of the
scheme as a means of performing various tasks,
such as generating new arguments in new cases,
or predicting ultimate case outcomes; and (4) the
interoperability of the scheme with existing on-
tologies and datasets. Although many researchers
have tested systems for automatically annotating
legal texts (see references discussed in Section
8), we believe that critical work remains to be
done on empirically developing an annotation
scheme that is adequate for representing natural
language arguments in legal texts, for the pur-
pose of assisting in the generation of new argu-
ments in new cases.

8 Prior Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995488">
Our strategic approach is both empirical and log-
ical in nature. Our approach is empirical because
we consider it crucial to use a corpus of diverse
and linguistically rich legal decisions to gain in-
sights into actual argument patterns. We also
take the typical approach of logic in looking for
patterns of successful and unsuccessful argument
at a “local” level, in the relationships among
premises and conclusions (the distinction be-
tween “local” and “global” is due to Mochales
and Moens, 2011, pp. 3-8). Local argument pat-
terns (which frequently occur within a single
paragraph) are distinguished from the global ar-
gument pattern that supports the ultimate deci-
sion on a claim (often the conclusion of an entire
decision) (id.). We briefly mention here recent
research bearing on our work.
Mochales and Moens (2011, pp. 5-6; 2008, pp.
12-14) annotated a corpus of 47 judicial deci-
sions from the European Court of Human Rights
using a system of argumentation schemes devel-
oped by Walton (1996; Walton et al., 2008).
They focused on “The Law” sections of the judi-
cial opinions, which discuss the arguments of the
parties and the court’s reasons supporting its de-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99995638028169">
cision. Thus, their focal point within the judicial
decisions is similar to that in our study of the
vaccine cases (factfinder reasoning) and their
attention to the local argument patterns is similar
to ours. One major difference might be that the
reasoning in our judicial decisions usually rests
heavily upon scientific and medical evidence,
including expert opinions.
Saravanan and Ravindran (2010, pp. 47-53,
65-66) manually annotated sentences in a corpus
of 200 decisions (approximately 16,000 sentenc-
es) from Indian courts using a “rhetorical” anno-
tation scheme containing 7 categories: “identify-
ing the case,” “establishing facts of the case,”
“arguing the case,” “history of the case,” “argu-
ments (analysis),” “ratio decidendi (ratio of the
decision),” and “final decision (disposal).” It is
unclear how many of these rhetorical categories
will play a role in defining useful local argument
patterns in U.S. cases.
Ashley and BrŸninghaus (2009, pp. 132-43;
BrŸninghaus and Ashley 2005, pp. 65-67) inves-
tigated 146 cases involving trade secret misap-
propriation. “Squibs” of these cases (manually
prepared textual descriptions of the case facts)
contained sentences that were manually annotat-
ed with respect to being positive instances of 26
factors (a positive instance was a sentence “from
which it could be reasonably inferred” that the
factor “applied in the case”). A “factor” is a cat-
egory of facts that helps to predict the case out-
come for either the plaintiff or the defendant –
for example, Factor F4 represents the fact pattern
in which the defendant entered into a non-
disclosure agreement with the plaintiff, and F4
favors an ultimate decision for the plaintiff.
Chorley and Bench-Capon (2005) supplemented
these factors with “values,” in the context of
building a “theory.” Wyner and Peters (2010)
selected 39 of these cases and a limited number
of base factors, and developed semantically sali-
ent terms and synonyms for these factors. Even
assuming that case squibs retain the linguistic
richness of the original documents and contain a
sufficient number of negative instances (sentenc-
es that are irrelevant to argumentation), the goal
of annotating sentences for factors is to predict
the ultimate outcome in domain cases, and such
factors may or may not be relevant to local ar-
gument patterns within the case.
Biagioli et al. (2005), using a dataset of para-
graphs selected from Italian legislative texts,
classified the paragraphs into eleven types of
legislative “provision” (e.g., definition, obliga-
tion, prohibition, permission). Each type of pro-
vision takes various arguments – for example,
the provision type “obligation” takes as argu-
ments the “addressee,” the “action,” and a “third-
party.” Such types of provisions might well ap-
pear in local argument patterns, which apply le-
gal rules to evidence in a particular case.
Wyner et al. (2013, p. 167) annotated intellec-
tual property appellate cases using 32 annota-
tions, which were selected as being “those used
in practice in the analysis of cases in law
schools.” Annotation types ranged from “Judge
Name” to “Legal Facts” (“the legally relevant
facts of the case that are used in arguing the is-
sues”). While some of these annotation types
might be relevant to local argument patterns,
others probably are not.

9 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986421052632">
We have reported the preliminary results of our
efforts to develop an adequate type system or
annotation scheme for marking up successful and
unsuccessful patterns of argument in U.S. judi-
cial decisions. We are working from a corpus of
vaccine-injury compensation cases that report
factfinding about causation, based on both scien-
tific and non-scientific evidence and reasoning.
We have summarized and illustrated the patterns
of reasoning we are finding, and have discussed
our strategy for future research. What seems
clear is that the task of developing an adequate
type or annotation system is both difficult and
important. Without an adequate and operational
type system, we are unlikely to reach consensus
on argument corpora that can function as a gold
standard, or to make robust and useful progress
on automating the annotation of judicial deci-
sions for argumentation.

A “factor” is a category of facts that helps to predict the case outcome for either the plaintiff or the defendant – for example, Factor F4 represents the fact pattern in which the defendant entered into a nondisclo</context>

Chorley and Bench-Capon (2005) supplemented these factors with “values,” in the context of building a “theory.” Wyner and Peters (2010) selected 39 of these cases and a limited number of base factors, and developed semantically salient terms and synonyms for these factors.

This approach would draw upon inference methods studied in fields other than law, such as deductive logic, probability or statistics, science or medicine. We discuss some of these types of inference that we find in the vaccine cases. 4.1 Deductive Reasoning Occasionally reasoning is deductive in form – that is, if the premises are true then the conclusion must be true as well, and the sole avenue for undermining the argument is attacking the truth of the premises (Copi and Cohen 1998, p. 25). In such patterns, the supporting reasons are not merely a list, but rather a list of jointly sufficient reasons for drawing the inference as a necessary conclusion. For example, in Casey (p. 26), the conclusion that the varicella vaccine can negatively affect the nervous system was supported by a conjunction of two causal relations: that the vaccine can cause a direct viral infection, and that a direct viral infection can negatively affect the nervous system. Deductive patterns of reasoning, however, would have premises connected to the conclusion by the propositional connective MIN,</context>

This section illustrates some of the types of evidence we find recurring in vaccine cases. 5.1 Legal Precedent as Basis One of the most common patterns of legal reasoning involves the citation of prior legal decisions as precedents. Precedent-based reasoning occurs when judges or factfinders utilize prior cases as providing a binding rule or applicable principle, or as providing guidance by analogy to explain or justify an outcome in the undecided matter before them (Cross et al., 2010, pp. 490- 512; Levi 1949, pp. 8-27). In vaccine decisions, the special masters have utilized precedent-based reasoning in various ways. In Wolfe (pp. 9-11), for example, the petitioner’s expert based his theory of causation solely on the temporal relationship between the vaccination and the onset of the injury, together with a lack of alternative theories of causation.

Our approach is empirical because we consider it crucial to use a corpus of diverse and linguistically rich legal decisions to gain insights into actual argument patterns. We also take the typical approach of logic in looking for patterns of successful and unsuccessful argument at a “local” level, in the relationships among premises and conclusions (the distinction between “local” and “global” is due to Mochales and Moens, 2011, pp. 3-8). Local argument patterns (which frequently occur within a single paragraph) are distinguished from the global argument pattern that supports the ultimate decision on a claim (often the conclusion of an entire decision) (id.). We briefly mention here recent research bearing on our work. Mochales and Moens (2011, pp. 5-6; 2008, pp. 12-14) annotated a corpus of 47 judicial decisions from the European Court of Human Rights using a system of argumentation schemes developed by Walton (1996; Walton et al., 2008).

They focused on “The Law” sections of the judicial opinions, which discuss the arguments of the parties and the court’s reasons supporting its de7 cision. Thus, their focal point within the judicial decisions is similar to that in our study of the vaccine cases (factfinder reasoning) and their attention to the local argument patterns is similar to ours. One major difference might be that the reasoning in our judicial decisions usually rests heavily upon scientific and medical evidence, including expert opinions.

Third, Lab Director Walker performed an independent analysis, and he and the two student researchers discussed and documented any annotation issues, and decided on the final annotations. The resulting “logic model” of the reasoning for a single case integrates numerous units of reasoning into a single logical structure, with each unit consisting of one conclusion and one or more immediately supporting reasons (premises). Walker et al. (2011, pp. 296-300) provide details on the default-logic framework and on the logical connectives used in the LLT Lab’s logic models to connect the supporting reasons (premises) to the conclusion. Because evidentiary propositions (both conclusions and premises) have plausibility-values based on a seven-valued scale (from “highly plausible” through “undecided” to “highly implausible”), the logical connec2 tives must operate on a many-valued scale.

A “factor” is a category of facts that helps to predict the case outcome for either the plaintiff or the defendant – for example, Factor F4 represents the fact pattern in which the defendant entered into a nondisclosure agreement with the plaintiff, and F4 favors an ultimate decision for the plaintiff. Chorley and Bench-Capon (2005) supplemented these factors with “values,” in the context of building a “theory.” Wyner and Peters (2010) selected 39 of these cases and a limited number of base factors, and developed semantically salient terms and synonyms for these factors. Even assuming that case squibs retain the linguistic richness of the original documents and contain a sufficient number of negative instances (sentences that are irrelevant to argumentation), the goal of annotating sentences for factors is to predict the ultimate outcome in domain cases, and such factors may or may not be relevant to local argument patterns within the case.

Biagioli et al. (2005), using a dataset of paragraphs selected from Italian legislative texts, classified the paragraphs into eleven types of legislative “provision” (e.g., definition, obligation, prohibition, permission). Each type of provision takes various arguments – for example, the provision type “obligation” takes as arguments the “addressee,” the “action,” and a “thirdparty.” Such types of provisions might well appear in local argument patterns, which apply legal rules to evidence in a particular case. Wyner et al. (2013, p. 167) annotated intellectual property appellate cases using 32 annotations, which were selected as being “those used in practice in the analysis of cases in law schools.” Annotation types ranged from “Judge Name” to “Legal Facts” (“the legally relevant facts of the case that are used in arguing the issues”). While some of these annotation types might be relevant to local argument patterns, others probably are not. 9 Conclusion We have reported the preliminary results of our efforts to develop an adequate type system or annotation scheme for marking up successful and unsuccessful patterns o</context>

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999861944444444">
This research discusses preliminary efforts to
expand the coverage of the PropBank lexicon
to multi-word and idiomatic expressions, such
as take one for the team. Given overwhelming
numbers of such expressions, an efficient way
for increasing coverage is needed. This re-
search discusses an approach to adding multi-
word expressions to the PropBank lexicon in
an effective yet semantically rich fashion. The
pilot discussed here uses double annotation
of take multi-word expressions, where anno-
tations provide information on the best strat-
egy for adding the multi-word expression to
the lexicon. This work represents an impor-
tant step for enriching the semantic informa-
tion included in the PropBank corpus, which
is a valuable and comprehensive resource for
the field of Natural Language Processing.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964789473684">
The PropBank (PB) corpus provides informa-
tion associating semantic roles with certain syn-
tactic structures, thereby contributing valuable
training data for Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) applications (Palmer et al., 2005).
For example, recent research shows that us-
ing semantic role information in machine trans-
lation systems improves performance (Lo, Be-
loucif &amp; Wu, 2013). Despite these successes,
PB could be improved with greater coverage
of multi-word expressions (MWEs). The PB
lexicon (http://verbs.colorado.edu/PB/framesets-
english) is comprised of senses of verb, noun and
adjective relations, with a listing of their seman-
tic roles (thus a sense is referred to as a ‘roleset’).
Although the lexicon encompasses nearly 12,000
rolesets, relatively few of these apply to instances
of MWEs. PB has previously treated language
as if it were purely compositional, and has there-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999939888888889">
fore lumped the majority of MWEs in with lexi-
cal verb usages. For example, annotations of the
single PB sense of take meaning acquire, come to
have, choose, bring with you from somewhere in-
clude MWEs such as take measures, take comfort
and take advantage, and likely others. Although
PB senses typically, and this sense especially, are
quite coarse-grained, valuable semantic informa-
tion is lost when these distinct MWEs are lumped
together with other lexical senses.
The importance of coverage for MWEs is
underscored by their prevalence. Jackendoff
(1997:156) estimates that the number of MWEs
in a speaker’s lexicon is approximately equal to
the number of single words, and in WordNet
1.7 (Fellbaum, 1998), 41% of the entries were
MWEs (cited in Sag et al., 2002). Furthermore,
Sag (2002) estimates the vocabularies of special-
ized domains will continue to contribute more
MWEs than simplex words. For systems like PB
to continue to provide adequate training data for
NLP systems, coverage must extend to MWEs.
The lack of coverage in this area has already
become problematic for the recently developed
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) project
(Banarescu et al., 2013), which relies upon the PB
lexicon, or ‘frame files’ as the groundwork for its
annotations. As AMR and PB have extended into
more informal domains, such as online discussion
forums and SMS texts, the gaps in coverage of
MWEs have become more and more problematic.
To address this issue, this research discusses a pi-
lot approach to increasing the coverage of the PB
lexicon to a variety of MWEs involving the verb
take, demonstrating a methodology for efficiently
augmenting the lexicon with MWEs.

2 PB Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.934179230769231">
PB annotation was developed to provide training
data for supervised machine learning classifiers.
It provides semantic information, including the
Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2014), pages 94–98,

basic “who is doing what to whom,” in the form of
predicate-by-predicate semantic role assignments.
The annotation firstly consists of the selection of a
roleset, or a coarse-grained sense of the predicate,
which includes a listing of the roles, expressed
as generic argument numbers, associated with
that sense. Here, for example, is the roleset for
Take.01, mentioned previously:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.709182">
Take.01: acquire, come to have, choose, bring
Arg0: Taker
Arg1: Thing taken
Arg2: Taken-from, source of thing taken
</footnote>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.7977" genericHeader="method">
Arg3: Destination
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999825">
These argument numbers, along with a variety
of modifier tags, such as temporal and locative,
are assigned to natural language sentences drawn
from a variety of corpora. The roleset and example
sentences serve as a guide to annotators on how to
assign argument numbers to annotation instances.
The goal is to assign these simple, general-purpose
labels consistently across the many possible syn-
tactic realizations of the same event participant or
semantic role.
PB has recently undertaken efforts to expand
the types of predicates that are annotated. Pre-
viously, annotation efforts focused on verbs, but
events generally, and even the same event, can of-
ten be expressed with a variety of different parts of
speech, or with MWEs. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9996785">
1. He fears bears.
2. His fear of bears...
3. He is afraid of bears.
4. He has a fear of bears.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930818181818">
Thus, it has been necessary to expand PB annota-
tions to provide coverage for noun, adjective and
complex predicates. While this greatly enriches
the semantics that PB is able to capture, it has also
forced the creation of an overwhelming number of
new rolesets, as generally each new predicate type
receives its own set of rolesets. To alleviate this,
PB has opted to begin unifying frame files through
a process of ‘aliasing’(Bonial et al., 2014). In
this process, etymologically related concepts are
aliased to each other, and aliased rolesets are uni-
fied, so that there is a single roleset representing,
for example the concept of ‘fear,’ and this roleset
is used for all syntactic instantiations of that con-
cept.
This methodology is suited to complex pred-
icates, such as light verb constructions (LVCs),
wherein the eventive noun, carrying the bulk of the
event semantics, may have an etymologically re-
lated verb that is identical in its participants or se-
mantic roles (for a description of LVC annotation,
see (Hwang et al., 2010). Thus, have a fear above
is aliased to fear, as take a bath would be aliased
to bathe. In this research, the possibility of ex-
tending aliasing to a variety of MWEs is explored,
such that take it easy, as in “I’m just going to take
it easy on Saturday,” would be aliased to the exist-
ing lexical verb roleset for relax. In many cases,
the semantics of MWEs are quite complex, adding
shades of meaning that no lexical verb quite cap-
tures. Thus, additional strategies beyond aliasing
are developed; each strategy is discussed in the
following sections.

3 Take Pilot
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981346153846">
For the purposes of this pilot, the take MWEs
were gathered from WordNet’s MWE and phrasal
verb entries (Fellbaum, 1998), the Prague Czech-
English Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc-2012), and
Afsaneh Fazly’s dissertation work (Fazly, 2007).
Graduate student annotators were trained to use
WordNet, Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al., 2004)
and PB to complete double-blind annotation of
these MWEs as a candidate for one of the three fol-
lowing strategies for increasing roleset coverage:
1) Aliasing the MWE to a lexically-similar verb
or noun roleset from PB, 2) proposing the creation
of groups of expressions for which one or several
rolesets will be created, or 3) simply designating
the MWE as an idiomatic expression. First, anno-
tators were to try to choose a verb or noun roleset
from PB that most closely resembled the syntax
and semantics of the MWE. Annotators also made
comments as necessary for difficult cases. The
annotators were considered to have agreed if the
proposed lexical verb or noun alias was the same.
Strategies (2) and (3) were pursued during adjudi-
cation if the annotators were unable to agree upon
an appropriate alias. Each of the possible strate-
gies for increasing coverage is discussed in turn in
the following sections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998491">
3.1 Aliasing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998569666666667">
Aliasing involves proposing an existing roleset
from PB as a suitable roleset for future MWE an-
notation. LVCs were the simplest of these to alias
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.994796">
95
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992692307692">
since the eventive or stative noun predicate (e.g.:
take a look) may already have an existing role-
set, or there is likely an existing, etymologically
related verb roleset (e.g. verb roleset Look.01).
Some other MWEs were not so straightforward.
For instance, take time off does not include an et-
ymologically related predicate that would easily
encompass the semantics of the MWE, so the an-
notators proposed a roleset that is not as intuitive,
but captures the semantics nonetheless: the role-
set for the noun vacation. This frame allows for
an Agent to take time off, and importantly, what
time is taken off from: take time off from work,
school etc. Selecting an appropriate alias is the
ideal strategy for increasing coverage, because it
does not require the time and effort of manually
creating a new roleset or rolesets.
Both of the instances discussed above are rather
simple cases, where their coverage can be ad-
dressed efficiently through aliasing. However,
many MWE instances were considerably more
difficult to assign to an equivalent roleset. One
such example includes take shape, for which the
annotators decided that shape was an appropriate
roleset. Yet, shape does not quite cover the unique
semantics of take shape, which lacks the possibil-
ity of an Agent. In these cases, the MWEs may
still be aliased, but they should also include an
semantic constraint to convey the semantic differ-
ence, such as “-Agent” Thus, in some cases, these
types of semantic constraints were used for aliases
that were almost adequate, but lacked some shade
of meaning conveyed by the MWE. In other cases,
the semantic difference between an MWE and ex-
isting lexical verb or noun roleset was too great
to be captured by the addition of such constraints,
thus a new roleset or group of rolesets was created
to address coverage of such MWEs, as described
in the next section.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9952475">
3.2 Groups of Syntactically/Lexically Similar
Rolesets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969814814815">
In cases in which it was not possible to find a
single adequate alias for an MWE, a group of
rolesets representing different senses of the same
MWE was created. For example, take down can
mean to write something down, to defeat some-
thing, or to deconstruct something. Thus, a group
of take down rolesets were added, with each role-
set reflecting one of these senses.
Similarly, some of the proposed rolesets for
take MWEs were easily subsumed under a more
coarse-grained, new frame in PB. For instance,
take one’s lumps and take it on the chin both
more or less mean to endure or atone for, so com-
bining these in a coarser-grained MWE frame is
both efficient and allows for valuable distinctions
in terms of semantic role labeling. Namely, the
Agent choosing to atone for something, and what
the entity is atoning for. However, such situations
in which it’s possible to create new coarse-grained
MWE rolesets seem to be rare. Some MWEs ini-
tially seem similar enough to combine into a sin-
gle roleset, but further exploration of usages shows
that they are semantically different. Take comfort
and take heart in both involve improving mood,
but take heart in might be more closely-related to
hope in meaning, while take comfort in might sim-
ply mean to cheer up.

3.3 Idiomatic Expression Designation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966516129032">
In cases in which PB annotation would be very dif-
ficult for annotators, due to polysemy or semantics
that cannot be conveyed by aliasing to an exist-
ing roleset, MWEs will be listed for future annota-
tion as Idiomatic Expressions (IE), which get spe-
cial treatment. This designation indicates that the
MWE is so unique that it would require its own
new roleset(s) in PB, and even with these role-
sets, annotators may still have difficulty determin-
ing the appropriate roleset choice or sense of the
MWE. As mentioned previously, creating multi-
ple rolesets for each expression is inefficient, es-
pecially so if the rolesets manually created will be
difficult to distinguish; thus, currently such cases
are simply marked with the generic IE roleset.
The MWE take the count is an illustrative exam-
ple of this type of case. Undergraduate and grad-
uate annotators trained in linguistics tend to have
difficulty with detailed sports references in anno-
tation instances, regardless of how much context
is provided. This MWE applies to several sports
scenarios: one can take the count in boxing or
take the (full) count in baseball, and some usages
were even found for football, where many speak-
ers would use run down the clock. Annotators
unfamiliar with the somewhat esoteric meanings
of these phrases would undoubtedly have trouble
distinguishing the rolesets and arguments of the
rolesets, thus take the count in sports contexts (as
opposed to the LVC take the count, meaning to
count) will simply be designated IE.
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999837333333333">
Currently, IE instances are simply set aside
from the rest of the PB corpus, so as to avoid these
instances adding noise to the data. In the future,
these IE expressions will need to be treated indi-
vidually to determine the best way to capture their
unique semantics.

4 Results &amp; Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939181818182">
One way of analyzing the validity of this method-
ology is to examine the Inter-Annotator Agree-
ment (IAA) on the proposed alias. After the
training period (in which about 60 MWEs were
investigated as a group), annotators worked on
double-blind annotation of 100 additional MWEs.
Of these, 17 were found to be repeats of earlier
MWEs. Of the remaining 83, annotators agreed
on the exact alias in 32 cases, giving a rather poor,
simple IAA of about 39%. However, the stan-
dards used to calculate IAA were rigid, as only
instances in which the annotators aliased the mul-
tiword expressions to exactly the same lexical verb
or noun roleset were counted as an agreement.
Annotators often disagreed on lexical verbs, but
still chose verbs that were extraordinarily similar.
Take, for example, the MWE take back. One an-
notator chose to alias this MWE to retract while
the other annotator chose reclaim. It is safe to say
that both of these lexical verbs are equally logical
choices for take back and have similar semantic
and syntactic qualities. In other cases, annotators
had discovered different senses in their research
of usages, and therefore the aliases reflect differ-
ent senses of the MWE. Instances like these were
marked as disagreements, resulting in a mislead-
ingly low IAA. After discussion of disagreements,
IAA for these 83 MWEs rose to 78%, leaving 18
MWEs for which the annotators were unable to
agree on a strategy. Annotation proceeded with an
additional 76 MWEs, and for this set annotators
disagreed on only 6 MWEs. This process demon-
strates that although annotators may not agree on
the first alias that comes to mind, they tend to
agree on similar verbs that can capture the seman-
tics of an MWE appropriately. In a final adjudica-
tion pass, adjudicators discussed the cases of dis-
agreement with the annotators and made a final de-
cision on the strategy to be pursued.
In all, 159 unique MWEs were examined in
double-blind annotation. Of these, 21 were dis-
carded either because annotators felt they were
not truly MWEs, and could be treated composi-
tionally, or because they were very slight variants
of other MWEs. The following table shows how
many of the remaining 138 MWEs were agreed
upon for aliasing (and how many of these were
thought to be LVCs), how many cases led to the
addition of new rolesets, how many will be la-
beled IE in future annotation, and how many will
remain classed with the existing Take senses (note
that 4 MWEs were classed as having both a poten-
tial alias for LVC usages, and requiring rolesets
or another strategy for other usages; for example,
take the count discussed above). Overall, this pilot

demonstrated that the approach is promising, con-
sidering that it requires only about 20 new rolesets
to be created, as opposed to over 138 (given that
some MWEs have multiple senses, requiring mul-
tiple rolesets). As annotations move on to addi-
tional MWEs involving other verbs, a similar re-
duction in the roleset workload will be invaluable
to expanding PB.

5 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955666666667">
The next step in this research is to complete the
roleset unification, which allows the aliasing to
take effect. This process is currently underway.
Once this is complete, an investigation of take
annotations using the unified rolesets will be un-
dertaken, with special focus on whether IAA for
take instances is improved, and whether perfor-
mance of automatic Semantic Role Labeling and
Word Sense Disambiguation applications trained
on this data is improved. If results in these areas
are promising, this research will shift to analyzing
make, get, and have MWEs with this methodology.

In this process, etymologically related concepts are aliased to each other, and aliased rolesets are unified, so that there is a single roleset representing, for example the concept of ‘fear,’ and this roleset is used for all syntactic instantiations of that concept. This methodology is suited to complex predicates, such as light verb constructions (LVCs), wherein the eventive noun, carrying the bulk of the event semantics, may have an etymologically related verb that is identical in its participants or semantic roles (for a description of LVC annotation, see (Hwang et al., 2010). Thus, have a fear above is aliased to fear, as take a bath would be aliased to bathe. In this research, the possibility of extending aliasing to a variety of MWEs is explored, such that take it easy, as in “I’m just going to take it easy on Saturday,” would be aliased to the existing lexical verb roleset for relax.

This work represents an important step for enriching the semantic information included in the PropBank corpus, which is a valuable and comprehensive resource for the field of Natural Language Processing. 1 Introduction The PropBank (PB) corpus provides information associating semantic roles with certain syntactic structures, thereby contributing valuable training data for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications (Palmer et al., 2005). For example, recent research shows that using semantic role information in machine translation systems improves performance (Lo, Beloucif &amp; Wu, 2013). Despite these successes, PB could be improved with greater coverage of multi-word expressions (MWEs). The PB lexicon (http://verbs.colorado.edu/PB/framesetsenglish) is comprised of senses of verb, noun and adjective relations, with a listing of their semantic roles (thus a sense is referred to as a ‘roleset’). Although the lexicon encompasses nearly 12,000 rolesets, relatively few of these apply to instances of MWEs. PB has previously treated </context>

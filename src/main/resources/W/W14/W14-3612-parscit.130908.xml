This paper describes the process of creating a
novel resource, a parallel Arabizi-Arabic
script corpus of SMS/Chat data. The lan-
guage used in social media expresses many
differences from other written genres: its vo-
cabulary is informal with intentional devia-
tions from standard orthography such as re-
peated letters for emphasis; typos and non-
standard abbreviations are common; and non-
linguistic content is written out, such as
laughter, sound representations, and emoti-
cons. This situation is exacerbated in the
case of Arabic social media for two reasons.
First, Arabic dialects, commonly used in so-
cial media, are quite different from Modern
Standard Arabic phonologically, morphologi-
cally and lexically, and most importantly,
they lack standard orthographies. Second,
Arabic speakers in social media as well as
discussion forums, SMS messaging and
online chat often use a non-standard romani-
zation called Arabizi. In the context of natu-
ral language processing of social media Ara-
bic, transliterating from Arabizi of various
dialects to Arabic script is a necessary step,
since many of the existing state-of-the-art re-
sources for Arabic dialect processing expect
Arabic script input. The corpus described in
this paper is expected to support Arabic NLP
by providing this resource.

The language used in social media expresses
many differences from other written genres: its
vocabulary is informal with intentional devia-
tions from standard orthography such as repeated
letters for emphasis; typos and non-standard ab-
breviations are common; and non-linguistic con-
tent is written out, such as laughter, sound repre-
sentations, and emoticons.
This situation is exacerbated in the case of Ar-
abic social media for two reasons. First, Arabic
dialects, commonly used in social media, are
quite different from Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) phonologically, morphologically and lex-
ically, and most importantly, they lack standard
orthographies (Maamouri et.al. 2014). Second,
Arabic speakers in social media as well as dis-
cussion forums, Short Messaging System (SMS)
text messaging and online chat often use a non-
standard romanization called “Arabizi” (Dar-
wish, 2013). Social media communication in
Arabic takes place using a variety of orthogra-
phies and writing systems, including Arabic
script, Arabizi, and a mixture of the two. Alt-
hough not all social media communication uses
Arabizi, the use of Arabizi is prevalent enough to
pose a challenge for Arabic NLP research.
In the context of natural language processing
of social media Arabic, transliterating from
Arabizi of various dialects to Arabic script is a
necessary step, since many of the existing state-
of-the-art resources for Arabic dialect processing
and annotation expect Arabic script input (e.g.,
Salloum and Habash, 2011; Habash et al. 2012c;
Pasha et al., 2014).
To our knowledge, there are no naturally oc-
curring parallel texts of Arabizi and Arabic
script. In this paper, we describe the process of
creating such a novel resource at the Linguistic
Data Consortium (LDC). We believe this corpus
will be essential for developing robust tools for
converting Arabizi into Arabic script.

The rest of this paper describes the collection
of Egyptian SMS and Chat data and the creation
of a parallel text corpus of Arabizi and Arabic
script for the DARPA BOLT program.1 After
reviewing the history and features in Arabizi
(Section 2) and related work on Arabizi (Section
3), in Section 4, we describe our approach to col-
lecting the Egyptian SMS and Chat data and the
annotation and transliteration methodology of the
Arabizi SMS and Chat into Arabic script, while
in Section 5, we discuss the annotation results,
along with issues and challenges we encountered
in annotation.

2.1 What is Arabizi?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961285714286">
Arabizi is a non-standard romanization of Arabic
script that is widely adopted for communication
over the Internet (World Wide Web, email) or
for sending messages (instant messaging and
mobile phone text messaging) when the actual
Arabic script alphabet is either unavailable for
technical reasons or otherwise more difficult to
use. The use of Arabizi is attributed to different
reasons, from lack of good input methods on
some mobile devices to writers’ unfamiliarity
with Arabic keyboard. In some cases, writing in
Arabizi makes it easier to code switch to English
or French, which is something educated Arabic
speakers often do. Arabizi is used by speakers of
a variety of Arabic dialects.
Because of the informal nature of this system,
there is no single “correct” encoding, so some
character usage overlaps. Most of the encoding
in the system makes use of the Latin character
(as used in English and French) that best approx-
imates phonetically the Arabic letter that one
wants to express (for example, either b or p cor-
responds to ب). This may sometimes vary due to
regional variations in the pronunciation of the
Arabic letter (e.g., j is used to represent ﺝ in the
Levantine dialect, while in Egyptian dialect g is
used) or due to differences in the most common
non-Arabic second language (e.g., sh corre-
sponds to ش in the previously English dominated
Middle East Arab countries, while ch shows a
predominantly French influence as found in
North Africa and Lebanon). Those letters that do
not have a close phonetic approximate in the Lat-
in script are often expressed using numerals or
other characters, so that the numeral graphically

erational_Language_Translation_%28BOLT%29.aspx
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999467875">
approximates the Arabic letter that one wants to
express (e.g., the numeral 3 represents ع because
it looks like a mirror reflection of the letter).
Due to the use of Latin characters and also
frequent code switching in social media Arabizi,
it can be difficult to distinguish between Arabic
words written in Arabizi and entirely unrelated
foreign language words (Darwish 2013). For
example, mesh can be the English word, or
Arabizi for شم “not”. However, in context these
cases can be clearly labeled as either Arabic or a
foreign word. An additional complication is that
many words of foreign origin have become Ara-
bic words (“borrowings”). Examples include
banadoora ةرودنب “tomato” and mobile ليابوم
“mobile phone”. It is a well-known practical and
theoretical problem to distinguish borrowings
(foreign words that have become part of a lan-
guage and are incorporated fully into the mor-
phological and syntactic system of the host lan-
guage) from actual code switching (a bilingual
writer switches entirely to a different language,
even if for only a single word). Code switching
is easy to identify if we find an extended passage
in the foreign language which respects that lan-
guage’s syntax and morphology, such as Bas eh
ra2yak I have the mask. The problem arises
when single foreign words appear without Arabic
morphological marking: it is unclear if the writer
switched to the foreign language for one word or
whether he or she simply is using an Arabic
word of foreign origin. In the case of banadoora
ةرودنب “tomato”, there is little doubt that this has
become a fully Arabic word and the writer is not
code switching into Italian; this is also signaled
by the fact that a likely Arabizi spelling (such as
banadoora) is not in fact the Italian orthography
(pomodoro). However, the case is less clear cut
with mobile ليابوم “mobile phone”: even if it is a
borrowing (clearly much more recent than bana-
doora ةرودنب “tomato”), a writer will likely spell
the word with the English orthography as mobile
rather than write, say, mubail. More research is
needed on this issue. However, because of the
difficulty of establishing the difference between
code switching and borrowing, we do not attempt
to make this distinction in this annotation
scheme.

2.2 Egyptian Arabic Dialect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9590194">
Arabizi is used to write in multiple dialects of
Arabic, and differences between the dialects
themselves have an effect on the spellings cho-
sen by individual writers using Arabizi. Because
Egyptian Arabic is the dialect of the corpus cre-

ated for this project, we will briefly discuss some
of the most relevant features of Egyptian Arabic
with respect to Arabizi transliteration. For a
more extended discussion of the differences be-
tween MSA and Egyptian Arabic, see Habash et
al. (2012a) and Maamouri et al. (2014).
Phonologically, Egyptian Arabic is character-
ized by the following features, compared with
MSA:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.668459833333333">
(a) The loss of the interdentals /ð/ and /θ/
which are replaced by /d/ or /z/ and /t/ or /s/
respectively, thus giving those two original
consonants a heavier load. Examples in-
clude ركذ /zakar/ “to mention”, حبذ /dabaħ/
“to slaughter”, جلث /talg/ “ice”, نمث /taman/
“price”, and تبث /sibit/ “to stay in place,
become immobile”.
(b) The exclusion of /q/ and /ǰ/ from the conso-
nantal system, being replaced by the /?/ and
/g/, e.g., نطق /?uṭn/ “cotton”, and لمج
/gamal/ “camel”.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99892194117647">
At the level of morphology and syntax, the
structures of Egyptian Arabic closely resemble
the overall structures of MSA with relatively mi-
nor differences to speak of. Finally, the Egyptian
Arabic lexicon shows some significant elements
of semantic differentiation.
The most important morphological difference
between Egyptian Arabic and MSA is in the use
of some Egyptian clitics and affixes that do not
exist in MSA. For instance, Egyptian Arabic has
the future proclitics h+ and ħ+ as opposed to the
standard equivalent s+.
Lexically, there are lexical differences be-
tween Egyptian Arabic and MSA where no ety-
mological connection or no cognate spelling is
available. For example, the Egyptian Arabic صب
/buṣṣ/ “look” is رظنأ /’unZur/ in MSA.

Arabizi-Arabic Script Transliteration Previ-
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931193548387">
ous efforts on automatic transliterations from
Arabizi to Arabic script include work by Chalabi
and Gerges (2012), Darwish (2013) and Al-
Badrashiny et al. (2014). All of these approaches
rely on a model for character-to-character map-
ping that is used to generate a lattice of multiple
alternative words which are then selected among
using a language model. The training data used
by Darwish (2013) is publicly available but it is
quite limited (2,200 word pairs). The work we
are describing here can help substantially im-
prove the quality of such system. We use the
system of Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014) in this pa-
per as part of the automatic transliteration step
because they target the same conventional or-
thography of dialectal Arabic (CODA) (Habash
et al., 2012a, 2012b), which we also target.
There are several commercial products that con-
vert Arabizi to Arabic script, namely: Microsoft
Maren, 2 Google Ta3reeb, 3 Basis Arabic chat
translator4 and Yamli.5 Since these products are
for commercial purposes, there is little infor-
mation available about their approaches, and
whatever resources they use are not publicly
available for research purposes. Furthermore, as
Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014) point out, Maren,
Ta3reeb and Yamli are primarily intended as in-
put method support, not full text transliteration.
As a result, their users’ goal is to produce Arabic
script text not Arabizi text, which affects the
form of the romanization they utilize as an in-
termediate step. The differences between such
“functional romanization” and real Arabizi in-
clude that the users of these systems will use less
or no code switching to English, and may em-
ploy character sequences that help them arrive at
the target Arabic script form faster, which other-
wise they would not write if they were targeting
Arabizi (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014).
Name Transliteration There has been some
work on machine transliteration by Knight and
Graehl (1997). Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002)
introduced an approach for machine translitera-
tion of Arabic names. Freeman et al. (2006) also
introduced a system for name matching between
English and Arabic. Although the general goal
of transliterating from one script to another is
shared between these efforts and ours, we are
considering a more general form of the problem
in that we do not restrict ourselves to names.
Code Switching There is some work on code
switching between Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA). Zaidan and
Callison-Burch (2011) were interested in this
problem at the inter-sentence level. They
crawled a large dataset of MSA-DA news com-
mentaries, and used Amazon Mechanical Turk to
annotate the dataset at the sentence level.
Elfardy et al. (2013) presented a system, AIDA,
that tags each word in a sentence as either DA or
MSA based on the context. Lui et al. (2014)
proposed a system for language identification in

multilingual documents using a generative mix-
ture model that is based on supervised topic
modeling algorithms. Darwish (2013) and Voss
et al. (2014) deal with exactly the problem of
classifying tokens in Arabizi as Arabic or not.
More specifically, Voss et al. (2014) deal with
Moroccan Arabic, and with both French and
English, meaning they do a three-way classifica-
tion. Darwish (2013)&apos;s data is more focused on
Egyptian and Levantine Arabic and code switch-
ing with English.
Processing Social Media Text Finally, while
English NLP for social media has attracted con-
siderable attention recently (Clark and Araki,
2011; Gimpel et al., 2011; Gouws et al., 2011;
Ritter et al., 2011; Derczynski et al., 2013), there
has not been much work on Arabic yet. Darwish
et al. (2012) discuss NLP problems in retrieving
Arabic microblogs (tweets). They discuss many
of the same issues we do, notably the problems
arising from the use of dialectal Arabic such as
the lack of a standard orthography. Eskander et
al. (2013) described a method for normalizing
spontaneous orthography into CODA.

This work was prepared as part of the DARPA
Broad Operational Language Translation
(BOLT) program which aims at developing tech-
nology that enables English speakers to retrieve
and understand information from informal for-
eign language sources including chat, text mes-
saging and spoken conversations. LDC collects
and annotates informal linguistic data of English,
Chinese and Arabic, with Egyptian Arabic being
the representative of the Arabic language family.
Egyptian Arabic has the advantage over all other
dialects of Arabic of being the language of the
largest linguistic community in the Arab region,
and also of having a rich level of internet com-
munication.

4.1 SMS and Chat Collection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968379310345">
In BOLT Phase 2, LDC collected large volumes
of naturally occurring informal text (SMS) and
chat messages from individual users in English,
Chinese and Egyptian Arabic (Song et al., 2014).
Altogether we recruited 46 Egyptian Arabic par-
ticipants, and of those 26 contributed data. To
protect privacy, participation was completely
anonymous, and demographic information was
not collected. Participants completed a brief lan-
guage test to verify that they were native Egyp-
tian Arabic speakers. On average, each partici-
pant contributed 48K words. The Egyptian Ara-
bic SMS and Chat collection consisted of 2,140
conversations in a total of 475K words after
manual auditing by native speakers of Egyptian
Arabic to exclude inappropriate messages and
messages that were not Egyptian Arabic. 96% of
the collection came from the personal SMS or
Chat archives of participants, while 4% was col-
lected through LDC’s platform, which paired
participants and captured their live text messag-
ing (Song et al., 2014). A subset of the collec-
tion was then partitioned into training and eval
datasets.
Table 1 shows the distribution of Arabic script
vs. Arabizi in the training dataset. The conversa-
tions that contain Arabizi were then further anno-
tated and transliterated to create the Arabizi-

only 15% of conversations are entirely written in
Arabic script, while 66% are entirely Arabizi.
The remaining 19% contain a mixture of the two
at the conversation level. Most of the mixed
conversations were mixed in the sense that one
side of the conversation was in Arabizi and the
other side was in Arabic script, or in the sense
that at least one of the sides switched between
the two forms in mid-conversation. Only rarely
are individual messages in mixed scripts. The
annotation for this project was performed on the
Arabizi tokens only. Arabic script tokens were
not touched and were kept in their original
forms.
The use of Arabizi is predominant in the SMS
and Chat Egyptian collection, in addition to the
presence of other typical cross-linguistic text ef-
fects in social media data. For example, the use
of emoticons and emoji is frequent. We also ob-
served the frequent use of written out representa-
tions of speech effects, including representations
of laughter (e.g., hahaha), filled pauses (e.g.,
um), and other sounds (e.g., hmmm). When these
representations are written in Arabizi, many of
them are indistinguishable from the same repre-
sentations in English SMS data. Neologisms are
also frequently part of SMS/Chat in Egyptian
Arabic, as they are in other languages. English
words use Arabic morphology or determiners, as
in el anniversary “the anniversary”. Sometimes
English words are spelled in a way that is closer
phonetically to the way an Egyptian speaker
would pronounce them, for example lozar for
“loser”, or beace for “peace”.
The adoption of Arabizi for SMS and online
chat may also go some way to explaining the
high frequency of code mixing in the Egyptian
Arabic collection. While the auditing process
eliminated messages that were entirely in a non-
target language, many of the acceptable messag-
es contain a mixture of Egyptian Arabic and
English.

the two annotation tasks, which allowed annota-

To speed up the annotation process, we utilized
an automatic Arabizi-to-Arabic script translitera-
tion system (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014) which
was developed using a small vocabulary of 2,200
words from Darwish (2013) and an additional
6,300 Arabic-English proper name pairs (Buck-
walter, 2004). The system has an accuracy of
69.4%. We estimate that using this still allowed
us to cut down the amount of time needed to type
in the Arabic script version of the Arabizi by
two-thirds. This system did not identify Foreign
words or Names and transliterated all of the
words. In one quarter of the errors, the provided
answer was plausible but not CODA-compliant
(Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014).

4.5 Correction and Normalization of the
Transliteration According to CODA
Conventions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989461538461">
The goal of this task was to correct all spelling in
the Arabic script transliteration to CODA stand-
ards (Habash et al., 2012a, 2012b). This meant
that annotators were required to confirm both (1)
that the word was transliterated into Arabic script
correctly and also (2) that the transliterated word
conformed to CODA standards. The automatic
transliteration was provided to the annotators,
and manually corrected by annotators as needed.
Correcting spelling to a single standard (CO-
DA), however, necessarily included some degree
of normalization of the orthography, as the anno-
tators had to correct from a variety of dialect
spellings to a single CODA-compliant spelling
for each word. Because the goal was to reach a
consistent representation of each word, ortho-
graphic normalization was almost the inevitable
effect of correcting the automatic transliteration.
This consistent representation will allow down-
stream annotation tasks to take better advantage
of the SMS/Chat data. For example, more con-
sistent spelling of Egyptian Arabic words will
lead to better coverage from the CALIMA mor-
phological analyzer and therefore improve the
manual annotation task for morphological anno-
tation, as in Maamouri et al. (2014).

Consonantal ambiguities
Many consonants are ambiguous when written
in Arabizi, and many of the same consonants are
also difficult for the automatic transliteration
script. Annotators were instructed to correct any
errors of this type.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99550347826087">
• S vs. s/ ص vs. س
o use SAyg غياص and not sAyg غياس for

o use DAbT طباض and not ZAbT طباظ for
“officer”
o use Zlmp ةملظ and not Dlmp ةملض for
“darkness”
• Dotted ya vs. Alif Maqsura/ ي vs. ى. Alt-
hough the dotted ya/ ي and Alif Maqsura/ ى
are often used interchangeably in Egyptian
Arabic writing conventions, it was neces-
sary to make the distinction between the
two for this task.
o use Ely يلع and not ElY ىلع for “Ali”
(the proper name)
• Taa marbouta. In Arabizi and so also in the
Arabic script transliteration, the taa mar-
bouta/ ة may be written for both nominal fi-
nal -h/ ه and verbal final -t/ ت, but for dif-
ferent reasons.
o mdrsp Ely يلع ةسردم “Ali’s school”

Morphological ambiguities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.880534333333333">
Spelling variation and informal usage can
combine to create morphological ambiguities as
well. For example, the third person masculine
&apos; Both Arabic script and the Buckwalter transliteration
(http://www.qamus.org/transliteration.htm) are shown for
the transliterated examples in this paper.
singular pronoun and the third person plural ver-
bal suffix can be ambiguous in informal texts.
For example:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9252898">
• use byHbwA bED ضعب اوبحيب and not byHbh
bED ضعب هبحيب for “(They) loved each oth-
er”
• use byEmlwA اولمعيب and not byEmlh هلمعيب
for “(They) did” or “(They) worked”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998909">
In addition, because final -h is sometimes re-
placed in speech by final /-uw/, it was occasion-
ally necessary to correct cases of overuse of the
third person plural verbal suffix (-wA) to the
pronoun -h as well.
Merging and splitting tokens written with in-
correct word boundaries
Annotators were instructed to correct any
word that was incorrectly segmented. The anno-
tation tool allowed both the merging and splitting
of tokens.
Clitics were corrected to be attached when
necessary according to (MSA) standard writing
conventions. These include single letter proclit-
ics (both verbal and nominal) and the negation
suffix -$, as well as pronominal clitics such as
possessive pronouns and direct object pronouns.
For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.973002333333333">
• use fAlbyt تيبلاف and not
fAl byt تيب لاف or flbyt تيبلف for “in the
house”
• use EAlsTH حطسلاع and not
EAl sTH حطس لاع or ElsTH حطسلع for “on the
roof”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9810775">
The conjunction w- / -و is always attached to
its following word.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.86653325">
• use wkAn ناكو and not w kAn ناك و for
“and was”
• use wrAHt تحارو and not w rAHt تحار و
for “and (she) left”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9847545">
Words that were incorrectly segmented in the
Arabizi source were also merged. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.832421384615385">
• use msHwrp ةروحسم and not
ms Hwrp ةروح سم for “bewitched
(fem.sing.)”
• use $ErhA اهرعش and not $Er hA اه رعش for
“her hair”
Particles that are not attached in standard
MSA written forms were corrected as necessary
by the splitting function of the tool. For exam-
ple,
• use yA Emry يرمع اي and not yAEmry
يرمعاي for “Hey, dear!”
• use lA trwH حورت لا and not lAtrwH حورتلا

Abbreviations in Arabizi
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993958">
Three abbreviations in Arabizi received spe-
cial treatment: msa, isa, 7ma. These three abbre-
viations only were expanded out to their full
form using Arabic words in the corrected Arabic
script transliteration.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982565333333333">
• msa: use mA $A&apos; All—h الله ءاش ام for “As
God wills”
• isa: use &lt;n $A&apos; All—h الله ءاش نإ for “God
willing”
• 7ma: use AlHmd ll—h for دمح لا “Thank
God, Praised be the Lord”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.978187666666667">
All other Arabic abbreviations were not ex-
panded, and were transliterated simply letter for
letter. When the abbreviation was in English or
another foreign language, it was kept as is in the
transliteration, using both consonants and semi-
vowels to represent it.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977026333333333">
• use Awkyh هيكا for “OK” (note that this is
an abbreviation in English, but not in Egyp-
tian Arabic)

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.955076">
Correcting Arabic typos
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999764">
Annotators were instructed to correct typos in
the transliterated Arabic words, including typos
in proper names. However, typos and non-
standard spellings in the transliteration of a for-
eign words were kept as is and not corrected.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999135">
• Ramafan نافمر should be corrected to
rmDAn ناضمر for “Ramadan”
• babyy ييبب since it is the English word “ba-
by” it should not be corrected
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.949732166666667">
Flagged tokens in the correction task
Tokens flagged during task 1 as Sound and
Foreign were transliterated into Arabic script but
were not corrected during task 2. Note that even
when a whole phrase or sentence appeared in
English, the transliteration was not corrected.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.960937666666667">
• ks سك for “kiss”
• Dd yA hAf fAn ناف فاه اي دض for “did you
have fun”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999635">
The transliteration of proper names was cor-
rected in the same way as all other words.
Emoticons and emoji were replaced in the
transliteration with #. Emoticons refer to a set of
numbers or letters or punctuation marks used to
express feelings or mood. Emoji refers to a spe-
cial set of images used in messages. Both Emot-
icons and Emoji are frequent in SMS/Chat data.
Annotation and transliteration were performed
on all sentence units that contain Arabizi. Sen-
tence units that contain only Arabic script were
ignored and untouched during annotation. In
total, we reviewed 1270 conversations, among
which over 42.6K sentence units (more than
300K words) were deemed to be containing
Arabizi and hence annotated and transliterated.
The corpus files are in xml format. All con-
versations have six layers: source, annotation on
the source Arabizi tokens, automatic translitera-
tion via 3ARRIB, manual correction of the au-
tomatic transliteration, re-tokenized corrected
transliteration, and human translation. See Ap-
pendix A for examples of the file format.
Each conversation was annotated by one anno-
tator, with 10 percent of the data being reviewed
by a second annotator as a QC procedure. Twen-
ty six conversations (roughly 3400 words) were
also annotated dually by blind assignment to
gauge inter-annotator agreement.
As we noted earlier, code switching is fre-
quent in the SMS and Chat Arabizi data. There
were about 23K words flagged as foreign words.
Written out speech effects in this type of data are
also prevalent, and 6610 tokens were flagged as
Sounds (laughter, filled pause, etc.). Annotators
most often agreed with each other in the detec-
tion and flagging of tokens as Foreign, Name,
Sound or Punctuation, with over 98% agreement
for all flags.
The transliteration annotation was more diffi-
cult than the flagging annotation, because apply-
ing CODA requires linguistic knowledge of Ara-
bic. Annotators went through several rounds of
training and practice and only those who passed
a test were allowed to work on the task. In an
analysis of inter-annotator agreement in the dual-
ly annotated files, the overall agreement between
the two annotators was 86.4%. We analyzed all
the disagreements and classified them in four
high level categories:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.63788575">
• CODA 60% of the disagreements were related
to CODA decisions that did not carefully follow
the guidelines. Two-fifths of these cases were
related to Alif/Ya spelling (mostly Alif Hamza-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.984324857142857">
tion, rules of hamza support) and about one-fifth
involved the spelling of common dialectal words.
An additional one-third were due to non-CODA
root, pattern or affix spelling. Only one-tenth of
the cases were because of split or merge deci-
sions. These issues suggest that additional train-
ing may be needed. Additionally, since some of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9990955">
the CODA errors may be easy to detect and cor-
rect using available tools for morphological
analysis of Egyptian Arabic (such as the CALI-
MA-ARZ analyzer), we will consider integrating
such support in the annotation interface in the
future.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.914258368421053">
• Task In 23% of the overall disagreements, the
annotators did not follow the task guidelines for
handling punctuation, sounds, emoticons, names
or foreign words. Examples include disagree-
ment on whether a question mark should be split
or kept attached, or whether a non-Arabic word
should be corrected or not. Many of these cases
can also be caught as part of the interface; we
will consider the necessary extensions in the fu-
ture.
• Ambiguity In 12% of the cases, the annota-
tors’ disagreement reflected a different reading
of the Arabizi resulting in a different lemma or
inflectional feature. These differences are una-
voidable and reflect the natural ambiguity in the
task.
• Typos Finally, in less than 5% of the cases,
the disagreement was a result of a typographical
error unrelated to any of the above issues.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955333333333">
Among the cases that were easy to adjudicate,
one of the two annotators was correct 60% more
than the other. This is consistent with the obser-
vation that more training may be needed to fill in
some of the knowledge gaps or increase the an-
notator’s attention to detail.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872761904762">
This is the first Arabizi-Arabic script parallel
corpus that supports research on transliteration
from Arabizi to Arabic script. We expect to
make this corpus available through the Linguistic
Data Consortium in the near future.
This work focuses on the novel challenges of
developing a corpus like this, and points out the
close interaction between the orthographic form
of written informal genres of Arabic and the spe-
cific features of individual Arabic dialects. The
use of Arabizi and the use of Egyptian Arabic in
this corpus come together to present a host of
spelling ambiguities and multiplied forms that
were resolved in this corpus by the use of CODA
for Egyptian Arabic. Developing a similar cor-
pus and transliteration for other Arabic dialects
would be a rich area for future work.
We believe this corpus will be essential for
NLP work on Arabic dialects and informal gen-
res. In fact, this corpus has recently been used in
development by Eskander et al. (2014).

<abstract confidence="0.999525258064516">This paper describes the process of creating a novel resource, a parallel Arabizi-Arabic script corpus of SMS/Chat data. The language used in social media expresses many differences from other written genres: its vocabulary is informal with intentional deviations from standard orthography such as repeated letters for emphasis; typos and nonstandard abbreviations are common; and nonlinguistic content is written out, such as laughter, sound representations, and emoticons. This situation is exacerbated in the case of Arabic social media for two reasons. First, Arabic dialects, commonly used in social media, are quite different from Modern Standard Arabic phonologically, morphologically and lexically, and most importantly, they lack standard orthographies. Second, Arabic speakers in social media as well as discussion forums, SMS messaging and online chat often use a non-standard romanization called Arabizi. In the context of natural language processing of social media Arabic, transliterating from Arabizi of various dialects to Arabic script is a necessary step, since many of the existing state-of-the-art resources for Arabic dialect processing expect Arabic script input. The corpus described in this paper is expected to support Arabic NLP by providing this resource.</abstract>

(2014). All of these approaches rely on a model for character-to-character mapping that is used to generate a lattice of multiple alternative words which are then selected among using a language model. The training data used by Darwish (2013) is publicly available but it is quite limited (2,200 word pairs). The work we are describing here can help substantially improve the quality of such system. We use the system of Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014) in this paper as part of the automatic transliteration step because they target the same conventional orthography of dialectal Arabic (CODA) (Habash et al., 2012a, 2012b), which we also target. There are several commercial products that convert Arabizi to Arabic script, namely: Microsoft Maren, 2 Google Ta3reeb, 3 Basis Arabic chat translator4 and Yamli.5 Since these products are for commercial purposes, there is little information available about their approaches, and whatever resources they use are not publicly available for research purposes. Furthermore, as Al-Badrashiny et al. (2014) poi</context>

As a result, their users’ goal is to produce Arabic script text not Arabizi text, which affects the form of the romanization they utilize as an intermediate step. The differences between such “functional romanization” and real Arabizi include that the users of these systems will use less or no code switching to English, and may employ character sequences that help them arrive at the target Arabic script form faster, which otherwise they would not write if they were targeting Arabizi (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014). Name Transliteration There has been some work on machine transliteration by Knight and Graehl (1997). Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) introduced an approach for machine transliteration of Arabic names. Freeman et al. (2006) also introduced a system for name matching between English and Arabic. Although the general goal of transliterating from one script to another is shared between these efforts and ours, we are considering a more general form of the problem in that we do not restrict ourselves to names.

The system has an accuracy of 69.4%. We estimate that using this still allowed us to cut down the amount of time needed to type in the Arabic script version of the Arabizi by two-thirds. This system did not identify Foreign words or Names and transliterated all of the words.

First, Arabic dialects, commonly used in social media, are quite different from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) phonologically, morphologically and lexically, and most importantly, they lack standard orthographies (Maamouri et.al. 2014). Second, Arabic speakers in social media as well as discussion forums, Short Messaging System (SMS) text messaging and online chat often use a nonstandard romanization called “Arabizi” (Darwish, 2013). Social media communication in Arabic takes place using a variety of orthographies and writing systems, including Arabic script, Arabizi, and a mixture of the two. Although not all social media communication uses Arabizi, the use of Arabizi is prevalent enough to pose a challenge for Arabic NLP research.

Due to the use of Latin characters and also frequent code switching in social media Arabizi, it can be difficult to distinguish between Arabic words written in Arabizi and entirely unrelated foreign language words (Darwish 2013). For example, mesh can be the English word, or Arabizi for شم “not”. However, in context these cases can be clearly labeled as either Arabic or a foreign word. An additional complication is that many words of foreign origin have become Arabic words (“borrowings”). Examples include banadoora ةرودنب “tomato” and mobile ليابوم “mobile phone”. It is a well-known practical and theoretical problem to distinguish borrowings (foreign words that have become part of a language and are incorporated fully into the morphological and syntactic system of the host language) from actual code switching (a bili</context>

Code Switching There is some work on code switching between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA).

For a more extended discussion of the differences between MSA and Egyptian Arabic, see Habash et al. (2012a) and Maamouri et al. (2014). Phonologically, Egyptian Arabic is characterized by the following features, compared with MSA: (a) The loss of the interdentals /ð/ and /θ/ which are replaced by /d/ or /z/ and /t/ or /s/ respectively, thus giving those two original consonants a heavier load. Examples include ركذ /zakar/ “to mention”, حبذ /dabaħ/ “to slaughter”, جلث /talg/ “ice”, نمث /taman/ “price”, and تبث /sibit/ “to stay in place, become immobile”.

<context position="3383" citStr="Salloum and Habash, 2011" startWordPosition="482" endWordPosition="485">013). Social media communication in Arabic takes place using a variety of orthographies and writing systems, including Arabic script, Arabizi, and a mixture of the two. Although not all social media communication uses Arabizi, the use of Arabizi is prevalent enough to pose a challenge for Arabic NLP research. In the context of natural language processing of social media Arabic, transliterating from Arabizi of various dialects to Arabic script is a necessary step, since many of the existing stateof-the-art resources for Arabic dialect processing and annotation expect Arabic script input (e.g., Salloum and Habash, 2011; Habash et al. 2012c; Pasha et al., 2014). To our knowledge, there are no naturally occurring parallel texts of Arabizi and Arabic script. In this paper, we describe the process of creating such a novel resource at the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). We believe this corpus will be essential for developing robust tools for converting Arabizi into Arabic script. 93 Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Arabic Natural Langauge Processing (ANLP), pages 93–103, October 25, 2014, Doha, Qatar. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics The rest of this paper describes the collection of E</context>

LDC collects and annotates informal linguistic data of English, Chinese and Arabic, with Egyptian Arabic being the representative of the Arabic language family. Egyptian Arabic has the advantage over all other dialects of Arabic of being the language of the largest linguistic community in the Arab region, and also of having a rich level of internet communication. 4.1 SMS and Chat Collection In BOLT Phase 2, LDC collected large volumes of naturally occurring informal text (SMS) and chat messages from individual users in English, Chinese and Egyptian Arabic (Song et al., 2014). Altogether we recruited 46 Egyptian Arabic participants, and of those 26 contributed data. To protect privacy, participation was completely anonymous, and demographic information was not collected. Participants completed a brief language test to verify that they were native Egyptian Arabic speakers. On average, each participant contributed 48K words. The Egyptian Arabic SMS and Chat collection consisted of 2,140 conversations in a total of 475K words after manual auditing by native speakers of Egyptian Arabic to exclude inappropriate messages and messages that were not Egyptian Arabic. 96% o</context>

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) introduced an approach for machine transliteration of Arabic names. Freeman et al. (2006) also introduced a system for name matching between English and Arabic. Although the general goal of transliterating from one script to another is shared between these efforts and ours, we are considering a more general form of the problem in that we do not restrict ourselves to names. Code Switching There is some work on code switching between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA). Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011) were interested in this problem at the inter-sentence level. They crawled a large dataset of MSA-DA news commentaries, and used Amazon Mechanical Turk to annotate the dataset at the sentence level. Elfardy et al.

<bodyText confidence="0.999445409090909">
In this paper we present the first appli-
cation of Native Language Identification
(NLI) to Arabic learner data. NLI, the task
of predicting a writer’s first language from
their writing in other languages has been
mostly investigated with English data, but
is now expanding to other languages. We
use L2 texts from the newly released Ara-
bic Learner Corpus and with a combina-
tion of three syntactic features (CFG pro-
duction rules, Arabic function words and
Part-of-Speech n-grams), we demonstrate
that they are useful for this task. Our sys-
tem achieves an accuracy of 41% against
a baseline of 23%, providing the first evi-
dence for classifier-based detection of lan-
guage transfer effects in L2 Arabic. Such
methods can be useful for studying lan-
guage transfer, developing teaching mate-
rials tailored to students’ native language
and forensic linguistics. Future directions
are discussed.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998833733333333">
Researchers in Second Language Acquisition
(SLA) investigate the multiplex of factors that
influence our ability to acquire new languages
and chief among these factors is the role of the
learner’s mother tongue. Recently this fundamen-
tal factor has been studied in Native Language
Identification (NLI), which aims to infer the native
language (L1) of an author based on texts writ-
ten in a second language (L2). Machine Learning
methods are usually used to identify language use
patterns common to speakers of the same L1.
The motivations for NLI are manifold. The use
of such techniques can help SLA researchers iden-
tify important L1-specific learning and teaching
issues. In turn, the identification of such issues can

enable researchers to develop pedagogical mate-
rial that takes into consideration a learner’s L1 and
addresses them. It can also be applied in a forensic
context, for example, to glean information about
the discriminant L1 cues in an anonymous text.
While almost all NLI research to date has fo-
cused on English L2 data, there is a growing need
to apply the techniques to other language in or-
der to assess the cross-language applicability. This
need is partially driven by the increasing number
of learners of various other languages.
One such case is the teaching of Arabic as a
Foreign Language, which has experienced unpar-
alleled growth in the past two decades. For a long
time the teaching of Arabic was not considered a
priority, but this view has now changed. Arabic is
now perceived as a critical and strategically use-
ful language (Ryding, 2013), with enrolments ris-
ing rapidly and already at an all time high (Wahba
et al., 2013). This trend is also reflected in the
NLP community, evidenced by the continuously
increasing research focus on Arabic tools and re-
sources (Habash, 2010).
A key objective of this study is to investigate
the efficacy of syntactic features for Arabic, a lan-
guage which is significantly different to English.
Arabic orthography is very different to English
with right-to-left text that uses connective letters.
Moreover, this is further complicated due to the
presence of word elongation, common ligatures,
zero-width diacritics and allographic variants. The
morphology of Arabic is also quite rich with many
morphemes that can appear as prefixes, suffixes or
even circumfixes. These mark grammatical infor-
mation including case, number, gender, and defi-
niteness amongst others. This leads to a sophisti-
cated morphotactic system.
Given the aforementioned differences with En-
glish, the main objective of this study is to deter-
mine if NLI techniques can be effective for detect-
ing L1 transfer effects in L2 Arabic.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99797505882353">
NLI has drawn the attention of many researchers
in recent years. With the influx of new researchers,
the most substantive work in this field has come
in the last few years, leading to the organization
of the inaugural NLI Shared Task in 2013 which
was attended by 29 teams from the NLP and SLA
areas. A detailed exposition of the shared task re-
sults and a review of prior NLI work can be found
in Tetreault et al. (2013).
While there exists a large body of literature pro-
duced in the last decade, almost all of this work
has focused exclusively on L2 English. The most
recent work in this field successfully presented
the first application of NLI to a large non-English
dataset (Malmasi and Dras, 2014a), evidencing the
usefulness of syntactic features in distinguishing
L2 Chinese texts.

3 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999553103448276">
Although the majority of currently available
learner corpora are based on English L2 (Granger,
2012), data from learners of other languages such
as Chinese have also attracted attention in the past
several years.
No Arabic learner corpora were available for a
long time. This paucity of data has been noted by
researchers (Abuhakema et al., 2008; Zaghouani
et al., 2014) and is thought to be due to issues such
as difficulties with non-Latin script and a lack of
linguistic and NLP software to work with the data.
More recently, the first version of the Arabic
Learner Corpus1 (ALC) was released by Alfaifi
and Atwell (2013). The corpus includes texts by
Arabic learners studying in Saudi Arabia, mostly
timed essays written in class. In total, 66 different
L1 backgrounds are represented. While texts by
native Arabic speakers studying to improve their
writing are also included, we do not utilize these.
We use the more recent second version of the
ALC (Alfaifi et al., 2014) as the data for our exper-
iments. While there are 66 different L1s in the cor-
pus, the majority of these have less than 10 texts
and cannot reliably be used for NLI. Instead we
use a subset of the corpus consisting of the top
seven native languages by number of texts. The
languages and document counts in each class are
shown in Table 1.

In this study we employ a supervised multi-class
classification approach. The learner texts are or-
ganized into classes according on the author’s L1
and these documents are used for training and test-
ing in our experiments. A diagram conceptualiz-
ing our NLI system is shown in Figure 1.

We experiment using three syntactic feature types
described in this section. As the ALC is not bal-
anced for topic, we do not consider the use of lex-
ical features such as word n-grams in this study.
Topic bias can occur as a result of the subject mat-
ters or topics of the texts to be classified not not
evenly distributed across the classes. For exam-
ple, if in our training data all the texts written by
English L1 speakers are on topic A, while all the
French L1 authors write about topic B, then we
have implicitly trained our classifier on the topics
as well. In this case the classifier learns to dis-
tinguish our target variable through another con-
founding variable.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999827317073171">
The most prominent finding here is that NLI tech-
niques can be successfully applied to Arabic, a
morphologically complex language differing sig-
nificantly from English, which has been the focus
of almost all previous research.
This is one of the very first applications of NLI
to a language other than English and an important
step in the growing field of NLI, particularly with
the current drive to investigate other languages.
This research, though preliminary, presents an ap-
proach to Arabic NLI and can serve as a step to-
wards further research in this area.
NLI technology has practical applications in
various fields. One potential application of NLI
is in the field of forensic linguistics (Gibbons,
2003; Coulthard and Johnson, 2007), a juncture
where the legal system and linguistic stylistics
intersect (Gibbons and Prakasam, 2004; McMe-
namin, 2002). In this context NLI can be used as a
tool for Authorship Profiling (Grant, 2007) in or-
der to provide evidence about the linguistic back-
ground of an author.
There are a number of situations where a text,
such as an anonymous letter, is the central piece of
evidence in an investigation. The ability to extract
additional information from an anonymous text
can enable the authorities and intelligence agen-
cies to learn more about threats and those respon-
sible for them. Clues about the native language
of a writer can help investigators in determining
the source of anonymous text and the importance
of this analysis is often bolstered by the fact that in
such scenarios, the only data available to users and
investigators is the text itself. One recently studied
example is the analysis of extremist related activ-
ity on the web (Abbasi and Chen, 2005).
Accordingly, we can see that from a forensic
point of view, NLI can be a useful tool for intel-
ligence and law enforcement agencies. In fact, re-
cent NLI research such as that related to the work
presented by (Perkins, 2014) has already attracted
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.993012033707865">
interest and funding from intelligence agencies
(Perkins, 2014, p. 17).
In addition to applications in forensic linguis-
tics, Arabic NLI can aid the development of re-
search tools for SLA researchers investigating lan-
guage transfer and cross-linguistic effects. Simi-
lar data-driven methods have been recently applied
to generate potential language transfer hypothe-
ses from the writings of English learners (Malmasi
and Dras, 2014c). With the use of an error anno-
tated corpus, which was not the case in this study,
the annotations could be used in conjunction with
similar linguistic features to study the syntactic
contexts in which different error types occur (Mal-
masi and Dras, 2014b).
Results from such approaches could be used
to create teaching material that is customized for
the learner’s L1. This approach has been pre-
viously shown to yield learning improvements
(Laufer and Girsai, 2008). The need for such
SLA tools is particularly salient for a complex lan-
guage such as Arabic which has several learning
stages (Mansouri, 2005), such as phrasal and inter-
phrasal agreement morphology, which are hierar-
chical and generally acquired in a specific order
(Nielsen, 1997).
The key shortcoming of this study, albeit be-
yond our control, is the limited amount of data
available for the experiments. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the smallest dataset used for this
task in terms of document count and length. In this
regard, we are surprised by relatively high classifi-
cation accuracy of our system, given the restricted
amount of training data available.
While it is hard to make comparisons with
most other experiments due to differing number
of classes, one comparable study is that of Wong
and Dras (2009) which used some similar features
on 7-class English dataset. Despite their use of
a much larger dataset7, our individual models are
only around 10% lower in accuracy.
We believe that this is a good result, given
our limited data. In their study of NLI corpora,
Brooke and Hirst (2011) showed that increasing
the amount of training data makes a very signifi-
cant difference in NLI accuracy for both syntactic
and lexical features. This was verified by Tetreault
et al. (2012) who showed that there is a very steep
rise in accuracy as the corpus size is increased to-

erage text lengths of more than 600 words.
wards 11,000 texts8. Based on this, we are con-
fident that given similarly sized training data, an
Arabic NLI system can achieve similar accuracies.
On a broader level, this highlights the need for
more large-scale L2 Arabic corpora.
Future work includes the application of our
methods to large-scale Arabic learner data as it be-
comes available. With the ongoing development
of the Arabic Learner Corpus and other projects
like the Qatar Arabic Language Bank (Mohit,
2013), this may happen in the very near future.
The application of more linguistically sophisti-
cated features also merits further investigation, but
this is limited by the availability of Arabic NLP
tools and resources. From a machine learning per-
spective, classifier ensembles have been recently
used for this task and shown to improve classifi-
cation accuracy (Malmasi et al., 2013; Tetreault et
al., 2012). Their application here could also in-
crease system accuracy.
We also leave the task of interpreting the lin-
guistic features that differentiate and characterize
L1s to future work. This seems to be the next log-
ical phase in NLI research and some methods to
automate the detection of language transfer fea-
tures have been recently proposed (Swanson and
Charniak, 2014; Malmasi and Dras, 2014c). This
research, however, is still at an early stage and
could benefit from the addition of more sophisti-
cated machine learning techniques.
More broadly, additional NLI experiments with
different languages are needed. Comparative stud-
ies using equivalent syntactic features but with dis-
tinct L1-L2 pairs can help us better understand
Cross-Linguistic Influence and its manifestations.
Such a framework could also help us better un-
derstand the differences between different L1-L2
language pairs.

In this work we identified the appropriate data and
tools to perform Arabic NLI and demonstrated that
syntactic features can be successfully applied, de-

techniques can be used to generate cross-linguistic
hypotheses and build research tools for Arabic
SLA. As the first machine learning based inves-
tigation of language transfer effects in L2 Ara-
bic, this work contributes important additional ev-

<abstract confidence="0.999386">In this paper we present the first application of Native Language Identification (NLI) to Arabic learner data. NLI, the task of predicting a writer’s first language from their writing in other languages has been mostly investigated with English data, but is now expanding to other languages. We use L2 texts from the newly released Arabic Learner Corpus and with a combination of three syntactic features (CFG production rules, Arabic function words and we demonstrate that they are useful for this task. Our system achieves an accuracy of 41% against a baseline of 23%, providing the first evidence for classifier-based detection of language transfer effects in L2 Arabic. Such methods can be useful for studying language transfer, developing teaching materials tailored to students’ native language and forensic linguistics. Future directions are discussed.</abstract>

The ability to extract additional information from an anonymous text can enable the authorities and intelligence agencies to learn more about threats and those responsible for them. Clues about the native language of a writer can help investigators in determining the source of anonymous text and the importance of this analysis is often bolstered by the fact that in such scenarios, the only data available to users and investigators is the text itself. One recently studied example is the analysis of extremist related activity on the web (Abbasi and Chen, 2005). Accordingly, we can see that from a forensic point of view, NLI can be a useful tool for intelligence and law enforcement agencies. In fact, recent NLI research such as that related to the work presented by (Perkins, 2014) has already attracted 183 interest and funding from intelligence agencies (Perkins, 2014, p. 17).

In this regard, we are surprised by relatively high classification accuracy of our system, given the restricted amount of training data available. While it is hard to make comparisons with most other experiments due to differing number of classes, one comparable study is that of Wong and Dras (2009) which used some similar features on 7-class English dataset. Despite their use of a much larger dataset7, our individual models are only around 10% lower in accuracy. We believe that this is a good result, given our limited data. In their study of NLI corpora, Brooke and Hirst (2011) showed that increasing the amount of training data makes a very significant difference in NLI accuracy for both syntactic and lexical features. This was verified by Tetreault et al. (2012) who showed that there is a very steep rise in accuracy as the corpus size is increased to7Wong and Dras (2009) had 110 texts per class, with average text lengths of more than 600 words. wards 11,000 texts8.

One such case is the teaching of Arabic as a Foreign Language, which has experienced unparalleled growth in the past two decades. For a long time the teaching of Arabic was not considered a priority, but this view has now changed. Arabic is now perceived as a critical and strategically useful language (Ryding, 2013), with enrolments rising rapidly and already at an all time high (Wahba et al., 2013). This trend is also reflected in the NLP community, evidenced by the continuously increasing research focus on Arabic tools and resources (Habash, 2010). A key objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of syntactic features for Arabic, a language which is significantly different to English. Arabic orthography is very different to English with right-to-left text that uses connective letters. Moreover, this is further complicated due to the presence of word elongation, common ligatures, zero-width diacritics and allographic variants. The morphology of Arabic is also quite rich with many morphemes that can appear as prefixes, suffixes or even circumfixes. These mark grammatical information including case, number, gender, and definit</context>

This research, though preliminary, presents an approach to Arabic NLI and can serve as a step towards further research in this area. NLI technology has practical applications in various fields. One potential application of NLI is in the field of forensic linguistics (Gibbons, 2003; Coulthard and Johnson, 2007), a juncture where the legal system and linguistic stylistics intersect (Gibbons and Prakasam, 2004; McMenamin, 2002). In this context NLI can be used as a tool for Authorship Profiling (Grant, 2007) in order to provide evidence about the linguistic background of an author. There are a number of situations where a text, such as an anonymous letter, is the central piece of evidence in an investigation. The ability to extract additional information from an anonymous text can enable the authorities and intelligence agencies to learn more about threats and those responsible for them. Clues about the native language of a writer can help investigators in determining the source of anonymous text and the importance </context>

One recently studied example is the analysis of extremist related activity on the web (Abbasi and Chen, 2005). Accordingly, we can see that from a forensic point of view, NLI can be a useful tool for intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

Arabic orthography is very different to English with right-to-left text that uses connective letters. Moreover, this is further complicated due to the presence of word elongation, common ligatures, zero-width diacritics and allographic variants. The morphology of Arabic is also quite rich with</context>

The key shortcoming of this study, albeit beyond our control, is the limited amount of data available for the experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the smallest dataset used for this task in terms of document count and length. In this regard, we are surprised by relatively high classification accuracy of our system, given the restricted amount of training data available. While it is hard to make comparisons with most other experiments due to differing number of classes, one comparable study is that of Wong and Dras (2009) which used some similar features on 7-class English dataset. Despite their use of a much larger dataset7, our individual models are only around 10% lower in accuracy. We believe that this is a good result, given our limited data. In their study of NLI corpora, Brooke and Hirst (2011) showed that increasing the amount of training data makes a very significant difference in NLI accuracy for both syntactic and lexical features. This was verified by Tetreault et al. (2012) who showed that there is a very steep rise in accuracy as the corpus size is increased to7Wong and Dras (2009) had 110 texts </context>

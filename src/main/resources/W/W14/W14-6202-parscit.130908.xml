The rapid growth in IT in the last two decades has led to a growth in the amount of information
available online. A new style for sharing information is social media. Social media is a contin-

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988">
The rapid growth in IT in the last two decades has led to a growth in the amount of information available
on the World Wide Web. A new style for exchanging and sharing information is social media. Social
media refers to the means of interaction among people in which they create, share, and exchange infor-
mation and ideas in virtual communities and networks (like Twitter and Facebook). According to CNN1,
more Americans get their news from the Internet than from newspapers or radio, and three-fourths say
they hear of news via e-mail or updates on social media sites. Social media, in many cases, provide more
up-to-date information than conventional sources like online news. To make use of this vast amount
of information, it is required to extract structured information out of these heterogeneous unstructured
information. Information Extraction (IE) is the research field that enables the use of such a vast amount
of unstructured distributed information in a structured way. IE systems analyse human language text
in order to extract information about different types of events, entities, or relationships. Structured in-
formation could be stored in Knowledge-bases (KB) which hold facts and relations extracted from the
free style text. A KB is an information repository that provides a means for information to be collected,
organized, shared, searched and utilized. It can be either machine-readable or intended for human use.
In this paper, we introduce a framework for IE from unstructured user generated contents on social
media. Although IE is a field of research that has been studied for long time, there is very few work
done on that field for social media contents. (Bontcheva et al., 2013) proposed TwitIE, an open-source
NLP pipeline customised to microblog text. However, TwitIE doesn’t provide mechanisms for messages
filtering or named entity disambiguation or relation/fact extraction. All efforts on IE field focus on facts
extraction from encyclopaedias like Wikipedia (Suchanek et al., 2007; Auer and Lehmann, 2007), or
from web pages (Nakashole et al., 2011; Carlson et al., 2010; Kushmerick et al., 1997; Crescenzi et al.,
2001).
IE from text is an important task in text mining. The general goal of information extraction is to
discover structured information from unstructured or semi-structured text. For example, given the tweets
shown in figure 1, we can extract the following information:

As we can see in the examples, IE can be applied for open or closed domain. Open IE is to extract
all possible relations and facts stated in a post as in examples 1 and 2. Closed domain IE is to extract
facts for a specific target domain or fill in predefined templates like example 3. Other meta data could
be extracted like the time or the source of the extracted fact. This could help in improving the precision
of the extraction process. For instance, in the 3rd example, it is not stated where exactly is the “1600
Belmont Avenue” or “2900 Avenue G.”. We could infer this extra knowledge from the source
of the tweet “Fort Worth Fire Dept”. Same with example 2, the word “Tottenham” is am-
biguous. Further information about the entity “Nacer Chadli” should help to link “Tottenham” to
“Tottenham Hotspur Football Club”.

2 Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9223615">
Application of the State-Of-The-Art approaches on social media is not reasonable for the following
challenges:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999678">
• Informal language: Posted texts are noisy and written in an informal setting, include misspellings,
lack punctuation and capitalisation, use non-standard abbreviations, and do not contain grammati-
cally correct sentences. Traditional KB construction approaches rely mostly on capitalization and
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.98138">
10
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.890028">
Part-Of-Speech tags to extract the named entities. The lack of such features in social media posts
makes the IE task more challenging.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9837065">
• Short context: There is a post length limit on some social media networks like Twitter. This
limit forces the users to use more abbreviations to express more information in their posts. The
shortness of the posts makes it more challenging to disambiguate mentioned entities and to resolve
co-references among tweets.
• Noisy sparse contents: The users’ posts on social media are not always important nor contain
useful information. Around 40% of twitter messages content are pointless babble2. Filtering is a
pre-processing step that is required to purify the input posts stream.
• Information about non-famous entities: The IE State-Of-The-Art approaches link the entities
involved in the extracted information to a KB. However, people normally use social media to express
information about themselves or about some small local events (street festival or accident) and thus
the involved entities are not contained in a KB. New ways of entity linkage need to be introduced
to suit IE from social media posts.
• Uncertain contents: Of course not every available information is trustworthy. In addition to errors
that may take place during the IE process, information contained in users’ contributions is often
partial, subject to evolution over time, in conflict with other sources, and sometimes untrustworthy.
It is required to handle the uncertainty involved in the extracted facts.

3 The State-Of-The-Art
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999454666666667">
In order to extract information from text, a set of subtasks has to be applied on the input text. Figure 2
shows the subtasks modules of a traditional IE system. Those modules are described according to the
State-Of-The-Art IE approaches as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99860045">
• Named Entity Extraction: A named entity is a sequence of words that designates some real world
entity (e.g. “California”, “Steve Jobs” and “Apple Inc.”). The task of named entity extraction (NEE),
is to identify named entities from free-form text. This task cannot be simply accomplished by string
matching against pre-compiled gazetteers because named entities of a given entity type usually do
not form a closed set and therefore any gazetteer would be incomplete. NEE approaches mainly
use capitalization features and Part-Of-Speech tags for recognizing named entities. Part-Of-Speech
(POS) tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular
Part-Of-Speech, based on both its definition, as well as its context (i.e. relationship with adjacent
and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph). A simplified form of this is commonly taught
to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.
• Named Entity Disambiguation: In natural language processing, named entity disambiguation
(NED) or entity linking is the task of determining the identity of entities mentioned in text. For
example, to link the mention “California” to the Wikipedia article “http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/California”. It is distinct from named entity extraction (NEE) in that it identifies
not the occurrence of names but their reference. NED needs a KB of entities to which names can
be linked. A popular choice for entity linking on open domain text is Wikipedia (Cucerzan, 2007;
Hoffart et al., 2011).
• Fact Extraction: In open IE, the goal of the fact extraction (FE) module is to detect and characterize
the semantic relations between entities in text or relations between entities and values. In closed
domain IE, the goal is to fill in a predefined template using the extracted named entities.

4 Proposed Framework
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999527">
To overcome the challenges facing IE from social media, State-Of-The-Art approaches need to be
adapted to suit the nature of social media posts. Here, we describe the key components and aspects
of our proposed framework (see figure 2) and show how it would overcome the challenges.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993278235294118">
• Noisy Text Filtering: There are millions of social media posts every day. For example, the average
number of tweets exceeds 140 million tweet per day sent by over 200 million users around the
world. These numbers are growing exponentially3. This huge number of posts not always contains
useful information about users, locations, events, etc. It is required to filter non-informative posts.
Filtering could be done based on domain or language or other criteria to make sure to keep only
relevant posts that contains information about the domain need to be processed. For example, if
we want to extract the results of all the football World Cup matches from tweets, we need to filter
millions of tweets to get only the subset of tweets that contain information about results of matches,
note that even this subset may contains predicted results or results changing during the matches.
• Named Entity Extraction: With the lack of formal writing style, we need new approaches for NEE
that don’t rely heavily on syntactic features like capitalization and POS. In (Habib et al., 2013), we
participated in a challenge to extract named entities from microposts of tweets, we proposed a new
approach that combines State-Of-The-Art techniques with clues derived from disambiguation step
to detect named entities. Our system named to be the best among all the challenge participants
(Basave et al., 2013).
• Named Entity Disambiguation: As stated in the State-Of-The-Art section, researchers normally
link entities to Wikipedia articles or to KB entries. For social media posts, sometimes this is not
</listItem>

possible as many of the mentioned entities cannot be linked to Wikipedia articles or a KB entries.
However, normally users have home pages or profiles on a social media network. Furthermore,
festivals and local events also commonly have home pages representing these events. In (Habib and
van Keulen, 2013), we proposed an open world approach for NED for tweets. Named entities are
disambiguated by linking them to a home page or a social network profile page in case they don’t
have a Wikipedia article. Target tweets (tweets revolving around same event) are used to enrich the
tweet context and hence to improve the effectiveness of finding the correct entity page. Other meta
data from users profiles could also be used to improve the disambiguation process.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.914973">
• Feedback Loops: In figure 2, we can see, in the traditional IE framework, the pipeline of the
subtasks. Each subtask processes the input and generates an output and passes this output to the
next subtask. There is no possibility of modifying or refining the output of one subtask once it is
already generated. In our framework, feedback plays a key role in the system. Every subtask gives
a feedback to the preceding subtask which allows for possibility of iterations of refinement (Habib
and van Keulen, 2012). For example, if the NEE module extracted the mention “Apple”. And
when NED module tries to disambiguate the extracted mention, it finds that it could not be linked
to any entity. This means that most probably this mention “Apple” refers to the fruit rather than
the company. In traditional approaches, such feedback cannot be passed, and the NED has to find
a page to link the extracted mention anyway. Furthermore, as “Apple” is not considered a named
entity anymore this may affect the decision made that this piece of text in non-informative and thus
should be filtered. This is typically how human beings interpret text. In (Habib et al., 2014), we
applied the proposed feedback loop on the #Microposts 2014 Named Entity Extraction and Linking
Challenge. Our system is ranked second among all the challenge participants (Cano Basave et al.,
2014).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984475">
Similarly, the feedback loop takes place between the FE and the NED modules. This feedback helps
resolving errors that took place earlier in the disambiguation step. For example in figure 3a, one
might interpret that the tweet refers to a match of “FC Twente” versus “Ajax Amsterdam” in the
Dutch football league. Unfortunately, this turns to be a wrong assumption after checking the tweet
in figure 3b which shows that the match was between “FC Tygerberg” and “Ajax Cape Town” in the
South African second division football league. A feedback from the FE module should trigger and
correct the wrong decision made earlier in the NED module. It is also possible that the FE module
sends a feedback message to the noisy text filtering module that the message is non-informative if
it failed to extract the required information or if the extracted fact contradicts other facts or rules.
For example, if we want to extract facts about the football World Cup, and we found a tweet the
contains a fact about football club (not national team) then a feedback message is sent back to the
noisy text filtering module to mark this tweet as irrelevant one.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.945611">
• Uncertainty Handling: As mentioned in the challenges, the information contained in the social
media posts involves high degree uncertainty due to many reason. We envision an approach that
fundamentally treats annotations and extracted information as uncertain throughout the process.
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.99858">
13
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964352941177">
(Goujon, 2009) models this uncertainty in a fuzzy way, however we believe that a probabilistic ap-
proach would be a better solution to handle such uncertainty. Probabilistic knowledge-bases (PKB)
are KBs where each fact is associated with a probability indicating how trustworthy is this fact.
Probabilities are updated according to many factors like time, users, contradiction or compatibility
with other facts, etc.
Using the same example (figure 3a) mentioned above, the mention “FCT” is linked to “FC Twente”
with some certainty confidence. This probability should be adjusted after processing the second
tweet shown in figure 3b which holds a contradicting fact about the mention “FCT”. Furthermore, a
new fact is added to the KB indicating that “FCT” is linked to “FC Tygerberg”. The benefit of using
a PKB is that we can keep both interpretations “FC Twente” and “FC Tygerberg” with different
probabilities assigned to them. Using a PKB, all information is preserved.
Another source of uncertainty is the knowledge updating. One true fact at certain point of time may
be wrong at a later point of time. Scores of sport games change over time. Twitter users normally
tweet about the score during and after the game. They may also write their predictions on the game
prior to the game itself. A probabilistic model should be developed to handle those uncertainties
using evidences like number of tweets with the same extracted result, number of re-tweets, time of
the tweets, last extracted result about the game, etc.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98700175">
• Modules Portability: Each module from our proposed framework could be customized and reused
individually or embedded inside other frameworks. For example, NEE and NED modules could be
used in a sentiment analysis system that measures the users opinions towards some product. Noisy
text filtering could be embedded inside a search engine for social media posts.

5 Knowledge exchange and impact
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991225">
The aim of this position paper is to propose a framework for information extraction from unstructured
user generated contents on social media. IE systems analyse human language text in order to extract
information about different types of events, entities, or relationships. Structured information could be
stored in KB which hold facts and relations extracted from the free style text. A KB is a special kind of
database for knowledge management. A KB is an information repository that provides a means for infor-
mation to be collected, organized, shared, searched and utilized. Information extraction has applications
in a wide range of domains. There is many stakeholders that would benefit from such framework. Here,
we give some examples for applications of information extraction:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978000166666667">
• Financial experts always look for specific information to help their decision making. Social media
is a very important source of information about shareholders attitudes and behaviours. For example,
a finance company may need to know the shareholders reaction towards some political action. Au-
tomatically finding such information from users posts on social media requires special information
extraction technologies to analyse social media streams and capture such information at runtime.
• Security agencies normally analyse large amounts of text manually to search for information about
people involved in criminal or terrorism activities. Social media is a continuously instantly updated
source of information. Football hooligans sometimes start their fight electronically on social media
networks even before the sport event. This information could be helpful to take actions to prevent
such violent, and destructive behaviours.
• With the fast growth of the Web, search engines have become an integral part of people’s daily
lives, and users’ search behaviours are much better understood now. Search based on bag-of-word

<bodyText confidence="0.9630706">
representation of documents provides less satisfactory results for the new challenges and demands.
More advanced search problems such as entity search, and question answering can provide users
with better search experience. To facilitate these search capabilities, information extraction is often
needed as a pre-processing step to enrich document representation or to populate an underlying
database.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996674">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925444444444">
Our main goal of this proposal is to provide an open source set of portable and customizable modules that
can be used by different stakeholders with different application needs on social media contents. Open
source software is a computer software with its source code made available and licensed with a license in
which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change and distribute the software to anyone and
for any purpose. This enables the ICT community from not only using but also developing and extending
the system according to their needs. Individuals and organizations always choose open source software
for their zero cost, and its adaptability.
Reusability would be a key feature in our framework design. In software industry, reusability is the
likelihood that a part of a system can be used again to add new functionalities with slight or no modifica-
tion. Reusable modules reduce implementation time and effort. As an example for possible contribution
to the society, we contribute to the TEC4SE project 4. The aim of the project is to improve the operational
decision-making within the security domain by gathering as much information available from different
sources (like cameras, police officers on field, or social media posts). Then these information is linked
and relationships between different information streams are found. The result is a good overview of what
is happening in the field of security in the region. Our contribution to this project to filter twitter stream
messages and enrich it by extracting named entities at run time. It will be more valuable to this project
to complete the whole IE process by building a complete KB from the extracted information for further
or later investigations.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997156">
IE for social media is an emerging field of research. The noisy contents, shortness of posts, informality
of used language, and the uncertainty involved, add more challenges to IE for social media over those of
formal news articles. In this paper we propose a framework to cope with those challenges through set
of portable modules. Messages filtering, feedback loops, and uncertainty handling are the key aspects of
our framework.

In traditional approaches, such feedback cannot be passed, and the NED has to find a page to link the extracted mention anyway. Furthermore, as “Apple” is not considered a named entity anymore this may affect the decision made that this piece of text in non-informative and thus should be filtered. This is typically how human beings interpret text. In (Habib et al., 2014), we applied the proposed feedback loop on the #Microposts 2014 Named Entity Extraction and Linking Challenge. Our system is ranked second among all the challenge participants (Cano Basave et al., 2014). Similarly, the feedback loop takes place between the FE and the NED modules. This feedback helps resolving errors that took place earlier in the disambiguation step. For example in figure 3a, one might interpret that the tweet refers to a match of “FC Twente” versus “Ajax Amsterdam” in the Dutch football league. Unfortunately, this turns to be a wrong assumption after checking the tweet in figure 3b which shows that the match was between “FC Tygerberg” and “Ajax Cape Town” in the South African second division football league. A feedback from the FE module should trigger and correct the wrong</context>

For example, to link the mention “California” to the Wikipedia article “http://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/California”. It is distinct from named entity extraction (NEE) in that it identifies not the occurrence of names but their reference. NED needs a KB of entities to which names can be linked. A popular choice for entity linking on open domain text is Wikipedia (Cucerzan, 2007; Hoffart et al., 2011). • Fact Extraction: In open IE, the goal of the fact extraction (FE) module is to detect and characterize the semantic relations between entities in text or relations between entities and values. In closed domain IE, the goal is to fill in a predefined template using the extracted named entities. 2http://web.archive.org/web/20110715062407/www.pearanalytics.com/blog/wp-content/ uploads/2010/05/Twitter-Study-August-2009.pdf 11 Figure 2: Traditional IE framework versus our proposed IE framework. 4 Proposed Framework To overcome the challenges facing IE from social media, S</context>

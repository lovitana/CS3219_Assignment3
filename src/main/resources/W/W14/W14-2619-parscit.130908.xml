Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999634473684211">
This paper illustrates the use of deep se-
mantic processing for sentiment analysis.
Existing methods for sentiment analysis
use supervised approaches which take into
account all the subjective words and or
phrases. Due to this, the fact that not all
of these words and phrases actually con-
tribute to the overall sentiment of the text
is ignored. We propose an unsupervised
rule-based approach using deep semantic
processing to identify only relevant sub-
jective terms. We generate a UNL (Uni-
versal Networking Language) graph for
the input text. Rules are applied on the
graph to extract relevant terms. The sen-
timent expressed in these terms is used to
figure out the overall sentiment of the text.
Results on binary sentiment classification
have shown promising results.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904862068966">
Many works in sentiment analysis try to make use
of shallow processing techniques. The common
thing in all these works is that they merely try to
identify sentiment-bearing expressions as shown
by Ruppenhofer and Rehbein (2012). No effort
has been made to identify which expression actu-
ally contributes to the overall sentiment of the text.
In Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya (2012) these ex-
pressions are given weight-age according to their
position w.r.t. the discourse elements in the text.
But it still takes into account each expression.
Semantic analysis is essential to understand the
exact meaning conveyed in the text. Some words
tend to mislead the meaning of a given piece of text
as shown in the previous example. WSD (Word
Sense Disambiguation) is a technique which can
been used to get the right sense of the word. Bal-
amurali et al., (2012) have made use of Word-
Net synsets for a supervised sentiment classifica-
tion task. Tamare (2010) and Rentoumi (2009)
have also shown a performance improvement by
using WSD as compared to word-based features
for a supervised sentiment classification task. In
Hasan et al., (2012), semantic concepts have been
used as additional features in addition to word-
based features to show a performance improve-
ment. Syntagmatic or structural properties of
text are used in many NLP applications like ma-
chine translation, speech recognition, named en-
tity recognition, etc. A clustering based approach
which makes use of syntactic features of text has
been shown to improve performance in Kashyap
et al., (2013). Another approach can be found
in Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya (2012) which
makes use of lightweight discourse for sentiment
analysis. In general, approaches using seman-
tic analysis are expensive than syntax-based ap-
proaches due to the shallow processing involved
in the latter. As pointed out earlier, all these works
incorporate all the sentiment-bearing expressions
to evaluate the overall sentiment of the text. The
fact that not all expressions contribute to the over-
all sentiment is completely ignored due to this.
Our approach tries to resolve this issue. To do this,
we create a UNL graph for each piece of text and
include only the relevant expressions to predict the
sentiment. Relevant expressions are those which
satisfy the rules/conditions. After getting these ex-
pressions, we use a simple dictionary lookup along
with attributes of words in a UNL graph to calcu-
late the sentiment.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 ex-
plains our approach in detail. The experimental
setup is explained in Section 4. Results of the ex-
periments are presented in Section 5. Section 6
discusses these results followed by conclusion in
Section 7. Section 8 hints at some future work.

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982926829268">
There has been a lot of work on using semantics
in sentiment analysis. Hasan et al., (2012) have
made use of semantic concepts as additional fea-
tures in a word-based supervised sentiment classi-
fier. Each entity is treated as a semantic concept
e.g. iPhone, Apple, Microsoft, MacBook, iPad,
etc.. Using these concepts as features, they try to
measure their correlation with positive and nega-
tive sentiments. In Verma et al., (2009), effort has
been made to construct document feature vectors
that are sentiment-sensitive and use world knowl-
edge. This has been achieved by incorporating
sentiment-bearing words as features in document
vectors. The use of WordNet synsets is found in
Balamurali et al., (2012), Rentoumi (2009) and
Tamara (2010). The one thing common with these
approaches is that they make use of shallow se-
mantics.An argument has been made in Choi and
Carde (2008) for determining the polarity of a
sentiment-bearing expression that words or con-
stituents within the expression can interact with
each other to yield a particular overall polarity.
Structural inference motivated by compositional
semantics has been used in this work. This work
shows use of deep semantic information for the
task of sentiment classification. A novel use of
semantic frames is found in Ruppenhofer and Re-
hbein (2012). As a step towards making use
of deep semantics, they propose SentiFrameNet
which is an extension to FrameNet. A semantic
frame can be thought of as a conceptual struc-
ture describing an event, relation, or object and
the participants in it. It has been shown that po-
tential and relevant sentiment bearing expressions
can be easily pulled out from the sentence using
the SentiFrameNet. All these works try to bridge
the gap between rule-based and machine-learning
based approaches but except the work in Ruppen-
hofer and Rehbein (2012), all the other approaches
consider all the sentiment-bearing expressions in
the text.

Before devising any solution to a problem, it is ad-
visable to have a concise definition of the prob-
lem. Let us look at the formal definition of the
sentiment analysis problem as given in Liu (2010).
Before we do that, let us consider the following
review for a movie, ”1) I went to watch the new
James Bond flick, Skyfall at IMAX which is the
best theater in Mumbai with my brother a month
ago. 2) I really liked the seating arrangement over
there. 3) The screenplay was superb and kept me
guessing till the end. 4) My brother doesnt like the
hospitality in the theater even now. 5) The movie
is really good and the best bond flick ever.” This is
a snippet of the review for a movie named Skyfall .
There are many entities and opinions expressed in
it. 1) is an objective statement. 2) is subjective but
is intended for the theater and not the movie. 3) is
a positive statement about the screenplay which is
an important aspect of the movie. 4) is a subjective
statement but is made by the authors brother and
also it is about the hospitality in the theater and
not the movie or any of its aspects. 5) reflects a
positive view of the movie for the author. We can
see from this example that not only the opinion but
the opinion holder and the entity about which the
opinion has been expressed are also very impor-
tant for sentiment analysis. Also, as can be seen
from 1),4) and 5) there is also a notion of time as-
sociated with every sentiment expressed. Now, let
us define the sentiment analysis problem formally
as given in Liu (2010).
A direct opinion about the object is a quintuple
&lt; oj, fjk, ooijkl, hi, tl &gt;, where oj is the the ob-
ject, fjk is the feature of the object oj, ooijkl is the
orientation or polarity of the opinion on feature
fjk of object oj, hi is the opinion holder and ti is
the time when the opinion is expressed by hi.
As can be seen from the formal definition of
sentiment analysis and the motivating example,
not all sentiment-bearing expressions contribute to
the overall sentiment of the text. To solve this
problem, we can make use of semantic roles in the
text. Semantic role is the underlying relationship
that the underlying participant has with the main
verb. To identify the semantic roles, we make use
of UNL in our approach.

UNL (Universal Networking Language)

<bodyText confidence="0.999857">
UNL is declarative formal language specifically
designed to represent semantic data extracted from
natural language texts. In UNL, the information
is represented by a semantic network, also called
UNL graph. UNL graph is made up of three dis-
crete semantic entities, Universal Words, Univer-
sal Relations, and Universal Attributes. Universal
Words are nodes in the semantic network, Univer-
sal Relations are arcs linking UWs, and Universal
attributes are properties of UWs. To understand

Here, ”I”, ”like”, ”bad”, and ”boy” are the

(modifier) are the Universal Relations. Universal
attributes are the properties associated with UWs

with the rules of our algorithm.

Syntax of a UNL relation is as shown below,
&lt; rel &gt;:&lt; scope &gt;&lt; source &gt;; &lt; target &gt;
Where, &lt; rel &gt; is the name of the rela-
tion, &lt; scope &gt; is the scope of the relation,
&lt; source &gt; is the UW that assigns the relation,
and &lt; target &gt; is the UW that receives the
relation
We have considered the following Universal re-
lations in our approach,
1) agt relation : agt stands for agent. An agent is
a participant in action that provokes a change of
state or location. The agt relation for the sentence
”John killed Mary” is agt( killed, John ). This
means that the action of killing was performed by
John.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993752583333333">
2) obj relation : obj stands for patient. A patient is
a participant in action that undergoes a change of
state or location. The obj relation for the sentence
”John killed Mary” is obj( killed, Mary ). This
means that the patient/object of killing is Mary.
3) aoj relation : aoj stands for object of an at-
tribute. In the sentence ”John is happy”, the aoj
relation is aoj( happy, John ).
4) mod relation: mod stands for modifier of an ob-
ject. In the sentence ”a beautiful book”, the mod
relation is mod( book, beautiful).
5) man relation : man relation stands for manner.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.959844774193549">
It is used to indicate how the action, experience or
process of an event is carried out. In the sentence
”The scenery is beautifully shot”, the man relation
is man( beautifully, shot).
6) and relation : and relation is used to state a
conjunction between two entities. In the sen-
tence ”Happy and cheerful”, the and relation is
and(Happy,cheerful).
Architecture
As show in Figure 1, the modifier ”bad” is associ-
ated with the object of the main verb. It shouldn’t
affect the sentiment of the main agent. Therefore,
we can ignore the modifier relation of the main ob-
ject in such cases. After doing that, the sentiment
of this sentence can be inferred to be positive. The
approach followed in the project is to first generate
a UNL graph for the given input sentence. Then a
set of rules is applied and used to infer the sen-
timent of the sentence. The process is shown in
Figure 2. The UNL generator shown in the Figure
2 has been developed at CFILT.1 Before, the given
piece of text is passed on to the UNL generator,
it goes through a number of pre-processing stages.
Removal of redundant punctuations, special char-
acters, emoticons, etc. are part of this process.
This is extremely important because the UNL gen-
erator is not able to handle special characters at the
moment. We can see that, the performance of the
overall system is limited by this. A more robust
version of the UNL generator will certainly allow
the system to infer the sentiment more accurately.

Rules

There is a separate rule for each relation. For each

by the system are as follows,

1) If a given UW is source of the agt relation, then
its polarity is added to the overall polarity of the

text. e.g., ”I like her”. Here, the agt relation will
be agt ( like, I ). The polarity of like being posi-
tive, the overall polarity of the text is positive. e.g,
”I don’t like her”. Here the agt relation will be agt
( like@not, I ). The polarity of like is positive but
it has an attribute @not so its polarity is negative.
The overall polarity of the text is negative in this
case.
2) If a given UW is source or target of the obj rela-
tion and has the attribute @entry then its polarity
is added to the overall polarity of the text. This
rule merely takes into account the main verb of
the sentence into account, and the it’s is polarity
considered. e.g., ”I like her”, here the obj relation
will be obj ( like@entry , her ). The polarity of
like being positive, the overall polarity of the text
is positive
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7517535">
3) If a given UW is the source of the aoj rela-
tion and has the attribute @entry then its polarity
is added to the overall polarity of the text. e.g.,
”Going downtown tonight it will be amazing on
the waterfront with the snow”. Here, the aoj re-
lation is aoj ( amazing@entry , it ). amazing has
a positive polarity and therefore overall polarity is
positive in this case.
4) If a given UW is the target of the mod relation
and the source UW has the attribute @entry or has
the attribute @indef then polarity of the target UW
is added to the overall polarity of the text. e.g., ”I
like that bad boy”. Here, the aoj relation is mod
( boy, bad ). bad has a negative polarity but the
source UW, boy does not have an @entry attribute.
So, in this case negative polarity of bad is not con-
sidered as should be the case. e.g., ”She has a
gorgeous face”. Here, the mod relation is mod (
face@indef , gorgeous). gorgeous has a positive
polarity and face has an attribute @indef. So, po-
larity of gorgeous should be considered.
5) If a given UW is the target of the man relation
and the source UW has the attribute @entry then
polarity of the target UW is added to the overall
polarity of the text. Or if the target UW has the
attribute @entry then also we can consider polar-
ity of the target UW. e.g., ”He always runs fast”.
Here, the aoj relation is mod ( run@entry , fast ).
fast has a positive polarity and the source UW, run
has the @entry attribute. So, in this case positive
polarity of fast is added to the overall polarity of
the sentence. Polarities of both the source and tar-
get UW of the and relation are considered.
6) In ”Happy and Cheerful”, the and relation is
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996828857142857">
and(Happy, Cheerful). Happy and Cheerful, both
have a positive polarity, which gives this sentence
an overall positive polarity.
The polarity value of each individual word is
looked up in a dictionary of positive of negative
words used is Liu (2010) After all the rules are
applied, summation of all the calculated polarity
values is done. If this sum is greater than 0 then it
is considered as positive, and negative otherwise.
This system is negative biased due to the fact that
people often tend to express negative sentiment in-
directly or by comparison with something good. A
more detailed discussion on negative texts is pro-
vided in section 6.

Analysis was performed for monolingual binary
sentiment classification task. The language used
in this case was English. The comparison was
done between 5 systems viz. System using words
as features, WordNet sense based system as given
in Balamurali et al., (2012), Clusters based sys-
tem as described in Kashyap et al., (2013), Dis-
course rules based system as given in Mukherjee

better than the UNL based system for positive re-

The UNL generator used in this case is the bottle-
neck in terms of performance due to it’s speed. It
can take a long time to generate UNL graphs for
large sentences. Also, it makes use of the stan-
dard NLP tools viz. parsing, co-reference resolu-
tion, etc. to assign the proper semantic roles in the
given text. It is well known fact that these tech-
niques work properly only on structured data. The
language used in the reviews present in both the
datasets is unstructured in considerable number of
cases. The UNL generator is still in its infancy
and cannot handle text involving special charac-
ters. Due to these reasons, a proper UNL graph is
not generated in some cases. Also, it is not able to
generator proper UNL graphs for even well struc-
tured sentences. As a result of these things, the
classification accuracy is low. Negative reviews
are difficult to classify due to comparitive state-
ments and presence of positive words. Also there
are some sarcastic sentences which are difficult to
classify. Sarcasm is a very difficult problem to
tackle. Some related works can be found in Car-
valho et al., (2009) and Muresan et al., (2011). In
some cases, the reviewers make use of their native
language and expressions. This is a big problem
for the task of monolingual sentiment classifica-
tion.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981">
This paper made use of deep semantics to tackle
the the problem of sentiment analysis. A seman-
tic role labeling method through generation of a
UNL graph was used to do this. The main mo-
tivation behind this research was the fact that not
all sentiment bearing expressions contribute to the
overall sentiment of the text. The approach was
evaluated on two datasets and compared with suc-
cessful previous approaches which don’t make use
of deep semantics. The system underperformed
all the supervised systems but showed promise by
yielding better results than the other rule-based ap-
proach. Also, in some cases the performance was
very close to the other supervised systems. The
system works well on sentences where are inher-
ently complex and difficult for sentiment analysis
as it makes use of semantic role labeling. Any rule
based system can never be exhaustive in terms of
rules. We always need to add new rules to improve
on it. In some case, adding new rules might cause
side-effects. In this case, as the rules are intuitive,
adding of new rules will be easy. Also, analysis
of the results hints at some ways to tackle specific
problems effectively.

Adding more rules to the system will help to im-

<abstract confidence="0.99969365">This paper illustrates the use of deep semantic processing for sentiment analysis. Existing methods for sentiment analysis use supervised approaches which take into account all the subjective words and or phrases. Due to this, the fact that not all of these words and phrases actually conto the overall sentiment of the is ignored. We propose an unsupervised rule-based approach using deep semantic processing to identify only relevant subjective terms. We generate a UNL (Universal Networking Language) graph for input Rules are applied on the graph to extract relevant terms. The sentiment expressed in these terms is used to out the overall sentiment of the Results on binary sentiment classification have shown promising results.</abstract>

The common thing in all these works is that they merely try to identify sentiment-bearing expressions as shown by Ruppenhofer and Rehbein (2012). No effort has been made to identify which expression actually contributes to the overall sentiment of the text.

The one thing common with these approaches is that they make use of shallow semantics.An argument has been made in Choi and Carde (2008) for determining the polarity of a sentiment-bearing expression that words or constituents within the expression can interact with each other to yield a particular overall polarity. Structural inference motivated by compositional semantics has been used in this work. This work shows use of deep semantic information for the task of sentiment classification. A novel use of semantic frames is found in Ruppenhofer and Rehbein (2012). As a step towards making use of deep semantics, they propose SentiFrameNet which is an extension to FrameNet. A semantic frame can be thought of as a conceptual structure describing an event, relation, or object and the participants in it. It has been shown that potential and relevant sentiment bearing expressions can be easily pulled out from the sentence using the SentiFrameNet. All these works try to bridge the gap between rule-based and machine-learning based approaches but except the work in Ruppenhofer and Rehbein (2012), all the other approaches consider all the sentiment-bearing expr</context>

WSD (Word Sense Disambiguation) is a technique which can been used to get the right sense of the word. Balamurali et al., (2012) have made use of WordNet synsets for a supervised sentiment classification task. Tamare (2010) and Rentoumi (2009) have also sho</context>

In Hasan et al., (2012), semantic concepts have been used as additional features in addition to wordbased features to show a performance improvement. Syntagmatic or structural properties of text are used in many NLP applications like machine translation, speech recognition, named entity recognition, etc. A clustering based approach which makes use of syntactic features of text has been shown to improve performance in Kashyap et al., (2013). Another approach can be found in Mukherjee and Bhattacharyya (2012) which makes use of lightweight discourse for sentiment analysis. In general, approaches using semantic analysis are expensive than syntax-based approaches due to the shallow processing involved in the latter. As pointed out earlier, all these works incorporate all the sentiment-bearing expressions to evaluate the overall sentiment of the text. The fact that not all expressions contribute to the overall sentiment is completely ignored due to this. Our approach tries to resolve this issue. To do this, we create a UNL graph for each piece of text and include only the relevant expressions to pred</context>

Let us look at the formal definition of the sentiment analysis problem as given in Liu (2010). Before we do that, let us consider the following review for a movie, ”1) I went to watch the new James Bond flick, Skyfall at IMAX which is the best theater in Mumbai with my brother a month ago. 2) I really liked the seating arrangement over there. 3) The screenplay was superb and kept me guessing till the end. 4) My brother doesnt like the hospitality in the theater even now. 5) The movie is really good and the best bond flick ever.” This is a snippet of the review for a movie named Skyfall . There are many entities and opinions expressed in it. 1) is an objective statement. 2) is subjecti</context>
<context position="7559" citStr="Liu (2010)" startWordPosition="1241" endWordPosition="1242">ect of the movie. 4) is a subjective statement but is made by the authors brother and also it is about the hospitality in the theater and not the movie or any of its aspects. 5) reflects a positive view of the movie for the author. We can see from this example that not only the opinion but the opinion holder and the entity about which the opinion has been expressed are also very important for sentiment analysis. Also, as can be seen from 1),4) and 5) there is also a notion of time associated with every sentiment expressed. Now, let us define the sentiment analysis problem formally as given in Liu (2010). A direct opinion about the object is a quintuple &lt; oj, fjk, ooijkl, hi, tl &gt;, where oj is the the object, fjk is the feature of the object oj, ooijkl is the orientation or polarity of the opinion on feature fjk of object oj, hi is the opinion holder and ti is the time when the opinion is expressed by hi. As can be seen from the formal definition of sentiment analysis and the motivating example, not all sentiment-bearing expressions contribute to the overall sentiment of the text. To solve this problem, we can make use of semantic roles in the text. Semantic role is the underlying relationshi</context>
<context position="14951" citStr="Liu (2010)" startWordPosition="2587" endWordPosition="2588">ns fast”. Here, the aoj relation is mod ( run@entry , fast ). fast has a positive polarity and the source UW, run has the @entry attribute. So, in this case positive polarity of fast is added to the overall polarity of the sentence. Polarities of both the source and target UW of the and relation are considered. 6) In ”Happy and Cheerful”, the and relation is and(Happy, Cheerful). Happy and Cheerful, both have a positive polarity, which gives this sentence an overall positive polarity. The polarity value of each individual word is looked up in a dictionary of positive of negative words used is Liu (2010) After all the rules are applied, summation of all the calculated polarity values is done. If this sum is greater than 0 then it is considered as positive, and negative otherwise. This system is negative biased due to the fact that people often tend to express negative sentiment indirectly or by comparison with something good.

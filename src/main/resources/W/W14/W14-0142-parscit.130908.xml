Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.997081875">
A wordnet is many things to many people: a graph
of inter-related lexicalised concepts, a taxonomy, a
thesaurus, and so on. A wordnet makes good sense
as the mainstay of any deep automated semantic
analysis of text. We have begun the construction
of a multi-component, multi-use toolkit of natural
language processing tools with plWordNet, a very
large Polish wordnet, at its centre. The components
will include plWordNet and its mapping onto an on-
tology (the upper level and elements of the middle
level), a lexicon of proper names and a semantic
valency lexicon. Some of those elements will be
aligned with plWordNet, and there will be a map-
ping onto Princeton WordNet. Several challenging
applications will show the utility of the toolkit in
practice.

1 How wordnets evolve

<bodyText confidence="0.999908214285714">
Wordnets start small but quickly grow to account
for much of the lexical material of the given lan-
guage. The size of version 3.1 of Princeton Word-
Net (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) is a de facto stan-
dard, even if this mature wordnet also keeps grow-
ing, albeit slowly.1 One of the resources which ap-
proach this size standard is plWordNet (Piasecki et
al., 2009), now in version 2.1. Languages change
continually, so lexicographers never rest, but one
can still ask when the development of a wordnet
ought to slow down, and whether there is an ap-
propriate steady state of a wordnet. That clearly is
a loaded question, and much depends on the lan-
guage. For example, suppose that a wordnet for

resentation and memory (Collins and Quillian, 1969). It now

ful semantic relations, glosses, links to ontologies, and more.

a richly inflected language with complex and var-
ied derivation was originally a translation of PWN.
Such a wordnet should, sooner or later, acquire se-
mantic relations which account accurately for its
unique lexical system..
A wordnet, even as developed as PWN, Ger-
maNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) or plWord-
Net (Maziarz et al., 2013a), serves many natu-
ral language processing (NLP) applications, yet
it seems neither feasible nor necessary to remake
wordnets into universal NLP resources. Instead,
we propose to mark clear boundaries around a
wordnet (what it should and what it should not
include), and treat it as a pivotal element of an
organic toolkit of inter-connected tools and re-
sources for the semantic analysis of texts, along
with the auxiliary morphological and syntactic
analysis tools. Our case study is such a toolkit,
now under development, centred on plWord-
Net 3.0 (also in development), and intended first
and foremost for research in the humanities.
In the remainder of the paper, we present the
main design assumptions and principles of that
project. We explain how comprehensive we want
plWordNet 3.0 to become, what size and what
coverage we envisage. We attempt to describe
how the toolkit will be built around plWordNet,
and we outline plans for its large-scale illustra-
tive applications in several domains. We discuss
how the components of the toolkit will be ex-
panded or constructed: plWordNet 3.0, its map-
ping to an ontology, and a semantic lexicon of
proper names. We also briefly present resources
for morphological and structural description, as-
sociated with the plWordNet system, among them
a lexicon of lexico-syntactic structures of multi-
word expressions and a valency lexicon linked to
plWordNet but developed independently.
This work is meant to take several years of ini-
tial effort and years of maintenance. We cannot
answer many design questions yet, but many will
be answered as the project unfolds. That is to say.
we want to interlace theory and practice.

2.1 The model of plWordNet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994425136">
There is a rather unfortunate tendency to treat
wordnets as a substitute for ontologies (which are
perhaps less well known and less easily avail-
able to the NLP community), but significant dif-
ferences are clear when one compares an ontology
with a wordnet understood as a lexico-semantic re-
source (Prévot et al., 2010). A systems of concepts
in a wordnet must be expressed entirely in a natu-
ral language – unlike ontologies. A strict knowl-
edge representation is required in an ontology, but
a wordnet works through words. The inherent am-
biguity of the lexical material makes very formal
definitions infeasible. In particular, synonymy is
a matter of degree, while concepts in an ontol-
ogy should be defined with certainty. A rigorous
construction of an ontology is not easy insofar as
language intuitions “get in the way”. For exam-
ple, PWN contains a network of conceptual rela-
tions between synsets which represent lexicalised
concepts, but – unsurprisingly – no formal defini-
tion of the notion of concept has been put forward
yet. PWN’s structure was shaped by the lexico-
semantic dependencies among words, not by for-
mal properties of an ontology structure.2
Corpus analysis can help recognise lexico-
semantic relations for inclusion in a wordnet.
Practical substitution tests can be formulated for
individual relations without committing to any
particular theory of lexical semantic or human
cognition, in the spirit of minimal commitment
(Maziarz et al., 2013b). A wordnet so conceived
provides a description of the lexical system which
is well defined and grounded in language data. It
can also be built up at a considerably low cost and
with a high degree of consistency.
Corpus-based wordnet development, which has

“straitjacket” of an ontology and the inevitable vagueness and
context-dependence of actual texts.
led to plWordNet 2.1, assumes a very large mono-
lingual corpus as the main source of lexical knowl-
edge. Software tools facilitate corpus brows-
ing and semi-automatic knowledge extraction (Pi-
asecki et al., 2009). Dictionaries and encyclope-
dias are consulted in order, if necessary. This rig-
orous procedure limits the variability of editing
decisions by circumscribing the role of linguistic
intuition, though intuition still has its place as a
final recourse.
A wordnet based very closely on language data
is easier to develop when its primitive is a linguis-
tically motivated construct: the lemma-sense pair
which we call the lexical unit (LU). The plWord-
Net model, described in detail in (Maziarz et al.,
2013b), considers lexico-semantic relations be-
tween LUs. LUs are grouped into synsets if they
share lexico-semantic relations from a pre-defined
repertory, called constitutive relations. They must
be fairly frequent (to describe many LUs), shared
among LUs (to define groups), grounded in the
linguistic tradition (to facilitate their consistent
understanding) and, if possible, already used in
other wordnets (to improve compatibility). One
of the effects is that synonymy is not a primary re-
lation. It is derived from other lexico-semantic re-
lations, notably hyponymy and hypernymy, which
are much simpler to recognise consistently. A rela-
tion between two synsets is directly derived from
lexico-semantic relations, and it is effectively an
abbreviation for a set of links defined for all pairs
of LUs from both synsets.
Not every lexico-semantic relation qualifies as
a constitutive relation. For example, antonymy
is not shared widely enough, and there are no
“co-antonyms” for the same LU. Antonymy ob-
viously belongs in a wordnet, but not as a defin-
ing factor. Another example: plWordNet does not
directly include derivational relations which de-
scribe transformations of the basic morphological
word forms. It only records lexico-semantic re-
lations signalled by those formal transformations.
For example, the same morpheme can be used to
create forms of different meanings, so in each case
we describe a different specific lexico-semantic re-
lation rather than the formal dependencies among
word forms (Piasecki et al., 2012b).
When we wrote precise definitions and substitu-
tion tests, we realised that several factors system-
atically constrain linking large sub-classes of LUs
by lexico-semantic relations. Three of those fac-
tors, stylistic registers, verb aspect and semantic
verb classes, apply frequently enough to allow ex-
plicit treatment in the relation definitions (Maziarz
et al., 2013b). They refer to the properties of
LUs, so we call them constitutive features. Re-
lations strictly limited to verbs of the same aspect
and semantic class include hyponymy and several
specific entailment relations such as inchoativity.
Registers explain many situations when pragmatic
limitations prevent LUs with the same denotation
from being used in the same contexts. Such LUs
do share some relations, so constraining relation
definitions by register compatibility helps shape
the wordnet structure consistently.
Glosses may play a secondary role in a rep-
resentation of lexical meaning based on the re-
lational paradigm, but writing them helps word-
net editors work with polysemous lemmas. They
are also helpful for human users and very use-
ful in applications. Automatically extracted us-
age examples, equally secondary, are very popu-
lar with users in linguistics. We will, therefore,
place plWordNet 3.0 glosses and examples in for
as many LUs as possible, though the final numbers
are hard to put now on this laborious process.
The system of lexico-semantic relations in
plWordNet 3.0 will not differ much from plWord-
Net 2.1. The verb hypernymy structure putting
verbs into semantic classes may have to be ad-
justed. The adverb network must be built from
scratch. It will also be important to increase net-
work density for the existing relation types.3
The whole plWordNet 3.0, together with all as-
sociated resources and mappings, will be naturally
available on an open WordNet-style licence.

Table 1 shows that plWordNet 2.1 comes close
in size to PWN 3.1: nearly the same number of
synsets, and about 2/3 of the lemmas and LUs. We
want the vocabulary to correspond to the contents
of a large morpho-syntactic dictionary (Saloni et
al., 2012) commonly used when processing Polish
texts, but the coverage is still far from that num-
ber.4 The target size of plWordNet 3.0 is not easy

words need a representation in wordnets more than
frequent words, well described by knowledge au-
tomatically extracted from a large corpus. Mea-
sures of semantic relatedness tend to be useless for
lemmas appearing less than 50 times in a corpus of
more than 1 billion tokens (Piasecki et al., 2009).
That said, it is unrealistic to aim for a wordnet with
full coverage of a frequency list based on a very
large corpus.
It is hard to say just how many words there are
in a language, never mind newest coinage. Cor-
pora, even huge, are not complete enough (Kor-
nai, 2002; Gale and Sampson, 1995, p. 218). One
might assess a lower bound of the vocabulary size
from existing dictionary sizes, or calculate it ana-
lytically with corpus and statistical methods.
English is often assumed to have the most
words. The Oxford English Dictionary (Simp-
son, 2013) contains 300k main entries (± lem-
mas) and 600k word forms, but no freshest neol-
ogisms. There are even larger dictionaries: Wo-
ordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal with 430k en-
tries (Nijhoff, 2001) and a 330k dictionary of
Grimm brothers (Grimm, 1999); both are con-
temporary and historical. A comparable Polish
dictionary from the early 1900s has 280k entries
(Karłowicz et al., 1900–1927; Piotrowski, 2003,
p. 604). Modern dictionaries of general Polish
have fewer entries: 130k (Zgółkowa, 1994–2005),
125k (180k LUs) (Doroszewski, 1963–1969),
100k (150k LUs) (Dubisz, 2004), 45k (100k LUs)
(Ba´nko, 2000). They do not contain many spe-
cialised words and senses from science, technol-
ogy, culture and so on, appropriate for a wordnet.

comparison – the estimates for plWordNet.
Krishnamurthy (2002) ties the corpus size to the
number of lemmas which occur 10+ times. We
added an extrapolation for plWordNet (Table 2):
174k lemmas, a little more than we propose to
have in plWordNet 3.0.6
If we could double our current corpus, the ap-
proximation in (Good and Toulmin, 1956; Efron
and Thisted, 1975, eq. 2.7) would be useful:

<bodyText confidence="0.998627272727273">
Δˆ is the size of a new vocabulary found in the
new part of the corpus, nx is number of word
types used x times in the source corpus (before
doubling). This gives 1,322,850 new word types
for the doubled plWordNet corpus. Standard de-
viation is given by formula (2.10) in (Efron and
Thisted, 1975) :
nx ≈ ±42k word types.
This approximation, however, takes into account
proper names, foreign words, typos and so on
(Kornai, 2002, p. 83), undesirable in our word-
net. Even if we conservatively assume 15% “real”
words,7 we can count on some 200k additional
lemmas. Multi-word lexical units would not be
included in that estimate. See Table 3 for details.
In the end, we set the target size of plWord-
Net 3.0 arbitrarily at 200,000 lemmas: a lot, but
it accords with the largest Polish dictionaries and
with corpus statistics – and with the policy of ac-
counting for rare lemmas. The completion is ex-
pected at the end of 2015. The number of synsets
(218,000) and LUs (250,000) has been estimated

with 10 or more corpus occurrences; the coefficient of deter-

by extrapolating the lemma-LU-synset ratios in
plWordNet 2.1.
The size of plWordNet has already far exceeded
the vocabulary of the average Polish user – by de-
sign. A wordnet should outstrip traditional dictio-
naries if it is to be part of language tools which
work on the Internet scale (with practically limit-
less vocabulary) and without the benefit of human
language intuition. plWordNet 3.0 will be part of
the CLARIN language technology infrastructure8
aimed at delivering research tools for processing
text and speech resources in the very broad domain
of the humanities and social sciences.
Not all applications benefit from a large word-
net. Word-sense disambiguation may suffer if
there are too many too fine sense distinctions, but
the granularity of the senses and the size in lem-
mas are not strictly correlated. The former is more
a matter of a construction decision, with relatively
infrequent cases of a lemma of the general register
assigned new specific senses.9
Wordnet construction based on knowledge ex-
tracted from a large corpus (Piasecki et al., 2009;
Piasecki et al., 2012a) reaches its limits when
the most frequent vocabulary has been accounted
for.10 A Polish corpus of significantly more than
the present 1.8 billion words is much harder to
make than it would be for English if one wants
to preserve quality.11 Pattern-based relation ex-
traction, better with low frequencies, tend to be
less complete and less productive than statistical
distribution-based methods. We will have to sup-
plement corpus data with knowledge from such
structured text resources as Wikipedia.

The current phase of our long-term project begins
with plWordNet 2.1: version 2.0 with improve-
ments due to the application of automated diag-
nostic tools, and a continually growing mapping
to PWN 3.1. The development of plWordNet has
been consistently carried out in WordnetLoom, a
wordnet editor with advanced graphical editing ca-
pabilities and a palette of corpus search, dictio-
nary search, structure checking and bookkeeping
tools (Piasecki et al., 2013). WordnetLoom im-
poses many constraints on the wordnet relation
structures, but we have discovered that more is re-

relations linking mutually a pair of synsets;

<bodyText confidence="0.9999391">
Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), a substantial
part of the lexicon, are under-represented in dictio-
naries and on frequency list. With effective MWE
detection, a very large corpus is the most reliable
source of MWEs, but (inconveniently) morpho-
logical analysis handles their elements separately.
We will expand the dictionary of lexico-morpho-
syntactic MWE structures from (Kurc et al., 2012)
to more than 60000 MWEs in a separate resource
linked to plWordNet 3.0.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999412">
3.2 Proper names
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971642857143">
We treat proper names (PNs) as separate from the
lexicon: very few PNs are present in general dic-
tionaries. That is why they do not belong in lexico-
semantic resources. In particular, hyponymy does
not really apply. An entity denoted by a PN is an
instance of a type. PNs are primarily characterised
by their referents, not by their semantic properties
revealed in use examples. One must know the ref-
erent of the given PN in order to to interpret it un-
ambiguously. The instance/type relations are not
lexico-semantic relations, so PNs can in principle
be linked directly to an ontology, not to a word-
net. There are, however, two arguments in favour
of linking PNs via a wordnet:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9997736">
1. lexico-syntactic contexts which signal in-
stance of links can be collected for many PNs
and common nouns;
2. for various good reasons, PNs are already
well represented in several wordnets.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986032258064">
As to argument 2: selected PNs are described in
plWordNet because they are the derivational bases
from which certain classes of frequent nouns and
adjectives are derived, cf (Maziarz et al., 2011).
Such PNs are part of the wordnet and are linked
by plWordNet instance/type relations.
Argument 1 is even more important for us. We
plan to describe semantically a very large number
of PNs, and do it semi-automatically based on the
information extracted from a large corpus (Kurc et
al., 2013). Such information can support linking
to a wordnet, but not directly to an ontology. Def-
inite noun phrases are also used as anaphoric ex-
pressions to refer to and substitute PNs. Heads of
such NPs are types for the substituted PNs or hy-
pernyms of the proper types. That is yet another
argument for linking PNs to an ontology via the
wordnet as an intermediary.
A PN semantic lexicon will then be a separate
resource linked to plWordNet 3.0 and through it to
an ontology – more below. We will build up to 2.5
million Polish PNs an existing resource of 1.4 mil-
lion.12 The number of semantic categories will go
from the present 52 up to more than 100. The cat-
egories will be mapped to plWordNet 3.0 synsets,
providing a default link for each PN belonging to
the given category. A more fine-grained mapping
may be considered for selected categories such as
persons. The PN lexicon is meant to be dynamic:
it will be automatically expanded given any new
corpus for a specific domain.

content of PWN. Only when the core of plWord-
Net was constructed did we start its mapping to
PWN (Rudnicka et al., 2012; K˛edzia et al., 2013),
noting a number of contrasts resulting from dif-
ferences between lexical systems of English and
Polish (e.g., lexical gaps, lexicalised grammatical
categories, different structuring of information) as
well as in the content and structural design of the
two networks.
The development of plWordNet 2.0 was inde-
pendent of PWN (other than its evident influence
as a general model). The mapping to PWN was
manual, bottom-up, for selected domains – per-
son, artefact, location, time, food and communi-
cation (Rudnicka et al., 2012). It was extended
in plWordNet 2.1 to round out the coverage of
those domains and to include PWN’s core synsets
(those representing the most frequent word senses)
(Boyd-Graber et al., 2006). All this will facilitate
linking to Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and
Foster, 2013) and perhaps other similar resources.
The procedure considers several candidate
inter-lingual relations (I-relations) in strict order.
Initially, we placed inter-register I-synonymy –
differently stylistically-marked words with close
meaning – low on the decision list. It is, how-
ever, a well-defined choice when a marked Pol-
ish LU occurs in plWordNet but its counterpart is
not in PWN, or even cannot be lexicalised in En-
glish. Now inter-register I-synonymy is next af-
ter I-synonymy. The same applies to inter-lingual
partial synonymy, when there is a partial overlap
of meaning and structure between the source and
target synsets. The overlap is immediately vis-
ible, so partial synonymy can be assigned right
after dismissing full synonymy. When neither I-
synonymy applies, I-hyponymy is considered (it
has turned out to be the most frequent I-relation),
then I-hypernymy, I-meronymy and I-holonymy.
Manual mapping onto PWN is also an opportu-
nity to verify plWordNet’s content and structure,
and repair errors. Linguists who did not create
some part of plWordNet take a second look at it.
The mapping procedure (Rudnicka et al., 2012) re-
lies on the comparison of the relation structures
for the corresponding synsets, so potential flaws in
the hypernymy structure on either side can be dis-
covered, especially because WordnetLoom visu-
alises such structures (many levels down and up).
The overall workload doubles in practice. Manual
mapping takes nearly as long as wordnet construc-
tion, but if it includes verification then result is a
lexical resource which allows a deep comparison
of the two lexical resources on a very large scale.
The whole plWordNet 3.0 will be mapped onto
PWN 3.1 (Rudnicka et al., 2012; K˛edzia et al.,
2013), and differences in lexical coverage will
likely be a problem. A virtual supplement to
Princeton WordNet 3.1 may be necessary to make
the mapping work for Polish material not present
yet on the English side (and give a boost to future
multilingual applications). Gaps and discrepan-
cies will be recorded and presented to the Prince-
ton WordNet team. The mapping has thus far fo-
cussed on nouns. Extending it to verbs and adjec-
tives may require a revised procedure.

3.4 The ontology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998138929824562">
In plWordNet project we have deliberately kept
the wordnet separate from any ontology, although
we are aware that such a relationship must be es-
tablished sooner or later. plWordNet has been built
as a faithful description of the Polish lexical sys-
tem providing an interface between the lexicon
and abstract concept structures of an ontology.
Ontologies make concepts unambiguous, but
natural language does not allow such “luxuries”.
Usage constrains meaning, and stylistic register is
a case in point. Some lexical-semantic relations
can link only words of identical or at least com-
patible registers.13 Such considerations should be
reflected in the wordnet structure. Constraints on
registers in plWordNet 2.1 are part of the defi-
nitions of selected lexico-semantic relations: hy-
ponymy and hypernymy can only connect words
of compatible registers, inter-register synonymy
accounts for near-synonymy with a tolerable reg-
ister difference, and so on.
A wordnet’s expressive power rests primarily
on the lexico-semantic relations it encodes. One
might say that, in the relational paradigm, all sup-
plementary data, e.g., glosses, are secondary, but
such a strict position would yield wordnets inade-
quate for applications. Given that ontologies con-
tain a different kind of information, it makes sense
to create a mapping from a wordnet to an ontol-
ogy and thus associate concepts with their lexi-
cal embodiment. Clearly, there is much linguistic
knowledge not expressible by lexico-semantic re-
lations, but it could appear in resources of other

but only dziewczyna is stylistically neutral, while laska is
strongly marked as colloquial.
types linked to wordnets, such as syntactic and se-
mantic valency frames (Hajnicz, 2012).
In theory, any ontology would work with
plWordNet, but SUMO (Pease, 2011) ought to
be favoured. There is a mapping from PWN
(Peace and Fellbaum, 2010), and other wordnets
linked to it are linked to SUMO at least indi-
rectly. The manually constructed plWordNet-to-
PWN mapping will help automate SUMO linking.
I-synonymy links can be unambiguously mapped
over. In other cases, ambiguity causes trou-
ble, e.g., between I-hypernymy and instances of
SUMO hyponymy. Synsets in plWordNet and ab-
stract SUMO concepts may have to be linked man-
ually. The ontology mapping will enable the con-
struction of an advanced shallow-semantic parser
for Polish which builds a partial semantic repre-
sentation from concepts acquired in SUMO via
plWordNet. The ontology mapping will also facil-
itate linking plWordNet 3.0 to the Global WordNet
Grid,14 and will support the building of multilin-
gual resources and applications.

4 The expectations

<bodyText confidence="0.99987552">
The construction of plWordNet 3.0 has started
in July 2013. Complete plWordNet hypernymy
branches are mapped to PWN in parallel by peo-
ple other than those who built those branches. We
expect plWordNet 3.0 to become a comprehen-
sive wordnet (&gt;200,000 lemmas) and one of the
largest ever Polish dictionaries of any kind. The
whole toolkit of semantic resources, completed
by the end of 2015, will include plWordNet 3.0,
a dynamic lexicon of 2.5 million PNs linked to
plWordNet, a mapping plWordNet-PWN and a
mapping of plWordNet to the top-level SUMO on-
tology plus selected medium-level ontologies. The
lexico-syntactic structure of plWordNet MWEs (at
least 60,000 lemmas) will be described in an asso-
ciated resource. The toolkit will also be integrated
with a syntactico-semantic valence lexicon.
The whole complex system of resources and
tools (e.g., for MWE and PN extraction), devel-
oped for the needs of the CLARIN project, is in-
tended to be a strong, universal basis for applica-
tions and for further resources and tools, e.g., a
wordnet-based lexical similarity measure.
The modularly constructed toolkit will have a
layered architecture of large software systems.

<abstract confidence="0.99929163063063">A wordnet is many things to many people: a graph of inter-related lexicalised concepts, a taxonomy, a thesaurus, and so on. A wordnet makes good sense as the mainstay of any deep automated semantic analysis of text. We have begun the construction of a multi-component, multi-use toolkit of natural language processing tools with plWordNet, a very large Polish wordnet, at its centre. The components will include plWordNet and its mapping onto an ontology (the upper level and elements of the middle level), a lexicon of proper names and a semantic valency lexicon. Some of those elements will be aligned with plWordNet, and there will be a mapping onto Princeton WordNet. Several challenging applications will show the utility of the toolkit in practice. 1 How wordnets evolve Wordnets start small but quickly grow to account for much of the lexical material of the given language. The size of version 3.1 of Princeton Word- (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) is a facto standard, even if this mature wordnet also keeps growalbeit One of the resources which approach this size standard is plWordNet (Piasecki et al., 2009), now in version 2.1. Languages change continually, so lexicographers never rest, but one can still ask when the development of a wordnet ought to slow down, and whether there is an appropriate steady state of a wordnet. That clearly is a loaded question, and much depends on the language. For example, suppose that a wordnet for began as a test of a theory of human semantic representation and memory (Collins and Quillian, 1969). It now features a comprehensive vocabulary, a set of universally useful semantic relations, glosses, links to ontologies, and more. a richly inflected language with complex and varied derivation was originally a translation of PWN. Such a wordnet should, sooner or later, acquire semantic relations which account accurately for its unique lexical system.. A wordnet, even as developed as PWN, GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) or plWord- Net (Maziarz et al., 2013a), serves many natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet it seems neither feasible nor necessary to remake wordnets into universal NLP resources. Instead, we propose to mark clear boundaries around a wordnet (what it should and what it should not include), and treat it as a pivotal element of an organic toolkit of inter-connected tools and resources for the semantic analysis of texts, along with the auxiliary morphological and syntactic analysis tools. Our case study is such a toolkit, now under development, centred on plWord- Net 3.0 (also in development), and intended first and foremost for research in the humanities. In the remainder of the paper, we present the main design assumptions and principles of that project. We explain how comprehensive we want plWordNet 3.0 to become, what size and what coverage we envisage. We attempt to describe how the toolkit will be built around plWordNet, and we outline plans for its large-scale illustrative applications in several domains. We discuss how the components of the toolkit will be expanded or constructed: plWordNet 3.0, its mapping to an ontology, and a semantic lexicon of proper names. We also briefly present resources morphological and structural description, associated with the plWordNet system, among them a lexicon of lexico-syntactic structures of multiword expressions and a valency lexicon linked to plWordNet but developed independently. This work is meant to take several years of initial effort and years of maintenance. We cannot many design questions but many will be answered as the project unfolds. That is to say. we want to interlace theory and practice. 2 The cornerstone 2.1 The model of plWordNet There is a rather unfortunate tendency to treat wordnets as a substitute for ontologies (which are perhaps less well known and less easily available to the NLP community), but significant differences are clear when one compares an ontology with a wordnet understood as a lexico-semantic resource (Prévot et al., 2010). A systems of concepts in a wordnet must be expressed entirely in a natural language – unlike ontologies. A strict knowledge representation is required in an ontology, but a wordnet works through words. The inherent ambiguity of the lexical material makes very formal definitions infeasible. In particular, synonymy is a matter of degree, while concepts in an ontology should be defined with certainty. A rigorous construction of an ontology is not easy insofar as language intuitions “get in the way”. For example, PWN contains a network of conceptual relabetween synsets which represent but – unsurprisingly – no formal definiof the notion of been put forward yet. PWN’s structure was shaped by the lexicosemantic dependencies among words, not by forproperties of an ontology Corpus analysis can help recognise lexicosemantic relations for inclusion in a wordnet. Practical substitution tests can be formulated for individual relations without committing to any particular theory of lexical semantic or human in the spirit of commitment (Maziarz et al., 2013b). A wordnet so conceived provides a description of the lexical system which is well defined and grounded in language data. It can also be built up at a considerably low cost and with a high degree of consistency. Corpus-based wordnet development, which has another way, there can be a disconnect between the “straitjacket” of an ontology and the inevitable vagueness and context-dependence of actual texts. led to plWordNet 2.1, assumes a very large monolingual corpus as the main source of lexical knowledge. Software tools facilitate corpus browsing and semi-automatic knowledge extraction (Piasecki et al., 2009). Dictionaries and encyclopedias are consulted in order, if necessary. This rigorous procedure limits the variability of editing decisions by circumscribing the role of linguistic intuition, though intuition still has its place as a final recourse. A wordnet based very closely on language data easier to develop when its primitive is a linguisconstruct: the lemma-sense pair we call the unit The plWord- Net model, described in detail in (Maziarz et al., 2013b), considers lexico-semantic relations between LUs. LUs are grouped into synsets if they share lexico-semantic relations from a pre-defined called They must fairly describe many LUs), LUs (to define groups), the linguistic tradition (to facilitate their consistent and, if possible, already other wordnets (to improve compatibility). One of the effects is that synonymy is not a primary relation. It is derived from other lexico-semantic relations, notably hyponymy and hypernymy, which are much simpler to recognise consistently. A relation between two synsets is directly derived from lexico-semantic relations, and it is effectively an abbreviation for a set of links defined for all pairs of LUs from both synsets. Not every lexico-semantic relation qualifies as a constitutive relation. For example, antonymy is not shared widely enough, and there are no “co-antonyms” for the same LU. Antonymy obviously belongs in a wordnet, but not as a defining factor. Another example: plWordNet does not directly include derivational relations which describe transformations of the basic morphological word forms. It only records lexico-semantic relations signalled by those formal transformations. For example, the same morpheme can be used to create forms of different meanings, so in each case we describe a different specific lexico-semantic relation rather than the formal dependencies among word forms (Piasecki et al., 2012b). When we wrote precise definitions and substitution tests, we realised that several factors systematically constrain linking large sub-classes of LUs lexico-semantic relations. Three of those factors, stylistic registers, verb aspect and semantic verb classes, apply frequently enough to allow explicit treatment in the relation definitions (Maziarz et al., 2013b). They refer to the properties of so we call them Relations strictly limited to verbs of the same aspect and semantic class include hyponymy and several specific entailment relations such as inchoativity. Registers explain many situations when pragmatic limitations prevent LUs with the same denotation from being used in the same contexts. Such LUs do share some relations, so constraining relation definitions by register compatibility helps shape the wordnet structure consistently. Glosses may play a secondary role in a representation of lexical meaning based on the relational paradigm, but writing them helps wordnet editors work with polysemous lemmas. They are also helpful for human users and very useful in applications. Automatically extracted usage examples, equally secondary, are very popular with users in linguistics. We will, therefore, place plWordNet 3.0 glosses and examples in for as many LUs as possible, though the final numbers are hard to put now on this laborious process. The system of lexico-semantic relations in plWordNet 3.0 will not differ much from plWord- Net 2.1. The verb hypernymy structure putting verbs into semantic classes may have to be adjusted. The adverb network must be built from scratch. It will also be important to increase netdensity for the existing relation The whole plWordNet 3.0, together with all associated resources and mappings, will be naturally on an licence. 2.2 Size matters Table 1 shows that plWordNet 2.1 comes close in size to PWN 3.1: nearly the same number of synsets, and about 2/3 of the lemmas and LUs. We want the vocabulary to correspond to the contents of a large morpho-syntactic dictionary (Saloni et al., 2012) commonly used when processing Polish texts, but the coverage is still far from that num- The target size of plWordNet 3.0 is not easy set but we know that it is better to count lemmas than synsets (assuming that all senses of are 3.99 relations per noun synset, 3.06 relations per verb synset, 1.56 per adjective synset inplWordNet 2.1.

Measures of semantic relatedness tend to be useless for lemmas appearing less than 50 times in a corpus of more than 1 billion tokens (Piasecki et al., 2009). That said, it is unrealistic to aim for a wordnet with full coverage of a frequency list based on a very large corpus. It is hard to say just how many words there are in a language, never mind newest coinage. Corpora, even huge, are not complete enough (Kornai, 2002; Gale and Sampson, 1995, p. 218). One might assess a lower bound of the vocabulary size from existing dictionary sizes, or calculate it analytically with corpus and statistical methods.

For comparison – the estimates for plWordNet. Krishnamurthy (2002) ties the corpus size to the number of lemmas which occur 10+ times. We added an extrapolation for plWordNet (Table 2): 174k lemmas, a little more than we propose to in plWordNet If we could double our current corpus, the approximation in (Good and Toulmin, 1956; Efron and Thisted, 1975, eq. 2.7) would be useful: 00 the size of a new vocabulary found in the part of the corpus, number of word used in the source corpus (before doubling). This gives 1,322,850 new word types for the doubled plWordNet corpus. Standard deviation is given by formula (2.10) in (Efron and Thisted, 1975) : word types. This approximation, however, takes into account proper names, foreign words, typos and so on (Kornai, 2002, p. 83), undesirable in our wordnet. Even if we conservatively assume 15% “real” can count on some 200k additional lemmas. Multi-word lexical units would not be included in that estimate. See Table 3 for details. In the end, we set the target size of plWord- Net 3.0 arbitrarily at 200,000 lemmas: a lot, but it accords with the largest Polish dictionaries and with corpus statistics – and with the policy of accounting for rare lemmas. The completion is expected at the end of 2015. The number of synsets (218,000) and LUs (250,000) has been estimated estimation was given by a regression curve: the corpus size and the number of words with 10 or more corpus occurrences; the coefficient of determination equals 0.996. The equality is of a power-law kind, as Guiraud’s law (Guiraud, 1954). we found 15 common words in a 100-word sample taken from the plWordNet corpus frequency list. Polish dictionaries 100-250k plWordNet 174k 10+ lemmas [K] doubled plWordNet +200k 0+ lemmas [GT] Table 3: Potential lemma count for plWordNet. Estimates due to Krishnamurthy [K] and Good &amp; Toulmin [GT]. by extrapolating the lemma-LU-synset ratios in plWordNet 2.1. The size of plWordNet has already far exceeded the vocabulary of the average Polish user – by design. A wordnet should outstrip traditional dictionaries if it is to be part of language tools which work on the Internet scale (with practically limitless vocabulary) and without the benefit of human language intuition. plWordNet 3.0 will be part of CLARIN language technology aimed at delivering research tools for processing text and speech resources in the very broad domain of the humanities and social sciences. Not all applications benefit from a large wordnet. Word-sense disambiguation may suffer if there are too many too fine sense distinctions, but the granularity of the senses and the size in lemmas are not strictly correlated. The former is more a matter of a construction decision, with relatively infrequent cases of a lemma of the general register new specific Wordnet construction based on knowledge extracted from a large corpus (Piasecki et al., 2009; Piasecki et al., 2012a) reaches its limits when the most frequent vocabulary has been accounted Polish corpus of significantly more than the present 1.8 billion words is much harder to make than it would be for English if one wants preserve relation extraction, better with low frequencies, tend to be less complete and less productive than statistical distribution-based methods. We will have to supplement corpus data with knowledge from such structured text resources as Wikipedia. http://clarin.eu small example: means an exercise or an ape, the latter very rare. measure of semantic relatedness works fine for 1,000 occurrences per one billion words, deteriorates for 100 occurrences and practically fails for 10. errors and irregularities quickly decrease the quality of morpho-syntactic preprocessing. � � E � 2.3 The quality The current phase of our long-term project begins with plWordNet 2.1: version 2.0 with improvements due to the application of automated diagnostic tools, and a continually growing mapping to PWN 3.1. The development of plWordNet has been consistently carried out in WordnetLoom, a wordnet editor with advanced graphical editing capabilities and a palette of corpus search, dictionary search, structure checking and bookkeeping tools (Piasecki et al., 2013). WordnetLoom imposes many constraints on the wordnet relation structures, but we have discovered that more is required. New rules include the following: • simple structural errors, such as the presence of lexical units (LUs) without synsets or links without the obligatory inverse counterpart for symmetric relations; • general semantic errors such as hypernymy and meronymy cycles, more than one relation linking a pair of synsets, or direct and indirect relations linking mutually a pair of synsets; • specific semantic rules developed for selected domains and hypernymy branches. 3 The toolkit of lexico-semantic resources 3.1 Multi-word expressions Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), a substantial part of the lexicon, are under-represented in dictionaries and on frequency list. With effective MWE detection, a very large corpus is the most reliable source of MWEs, but (inconveniently) morphological analysis handles their elements separately. We will expand the dictionary of lexico-morphosyntactic MWE structures from (Kurc et al., 2012) to more than 60000 MWEs in a separate resource linked to plWordNet 3.0. 3.2 Proper names We treat proper names (PNs) as separate from the lexicon: very few PNs are present in general dictionaries. That is why they do not belong in lexicosemantic resources. In particular, hyponymy does not really apply. An entity denoted by a PN is an a PNs are primarily characterised by their referents, not by their semantic properties revealed in use examples. One must know the referent of the given PN in order to to interpret it unambiguously. The instance/type relations are not lexico-semantic relations, so PNs can in principle be linked directly to an ontology, not to a wordnet. There are, however, two arguments in favour linking PNs wordnet: lexico-syntactic contexts which signal inof can be collected for many PNs and common nouns; 2. for various good reasons, PNs are already well represented in several wordnets. As to argument 2: selected PNs are described in plWordNet because they are the derivational bases from which certain classes of frequent nouns and adjectives are derived, cf (Maziarz et al., 2011). Such PNs are part of the wordnet and are linked by plWordNet instance/type relations. Argument 1 is even more important for us. We plan to describe semantically a very large number of PNs, and do it semi-automatically based on the information extracted from a large corpus (Kurc et al., 2013). Such information can support linking to a wordnet, but not directly to an ontology. Definite noun phrases are also used as anaphoric expressions to refer to and substitute PNs. Heads of such NPs are types for the substituted PNs or hypernyms of the proper types. That is yet another argument for linking PNs to an ontology via the wordnet as an intermediary. A PN semantic lexicon will then be a separate resource linked to plWordNet 3.0 and through it to an ontology – more below. We will build up to 2.5 million Polish PNs an existing resource of 1.4 mil- The number of semantic categories will go from the present 52 up to more than 100. The categories will be mapped to plWordNet 3.0 synsets, providing a default link for each PN belonging to the given category. A more fine-grained mapping may be considered for selected categories such as persons. The PN lexicon is meant to be dynamic: it will be automatically expanded given any new corpus for a specific domain. 3.3 Wordnets and mapping Unlike many other national wordnets constructed by the transfer and merge method, plWordNet has been built independently of PWN. That was a conscious choice motivated by the desire to offer a faithful description of a lexico-semantic system of Polish language, uninfluenced by the structure and narzedzia-i-zasoby/nelexicon content of PWN. Only when the core of plWord- Net was constructed did we start its mapping to (Rudnicka et al., 2012; et al., 2013), noting a number of contrasts resulting from differences between lexical systems of English and gaps, lexicalised grammatical categories, different structuring of information) as well as in the content and structural design of the two networks. The development of plWordNet 2.0 was independent of PWN (other than its evident influence as a general model). The mapping to PWN was manual, bottom-up, for selected domains – person, artefact, location, time, food and communication (Rudnicka et al., 2012). It was extended in plWordNet 2.1 to round out the coverage of those domains and to include PWN’s core synsets (those representing the most frequent word senses) (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006). All this will facilitate linking to Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013) and perhaps other similar resources. The procedure considers several candidate inter-lingual relations (I-relations) in strict order. Initially, we placed inter-register I-synonymy – differently stylistically-marked words with close meaning – low on the decision list. It is, however, a well-defined choice when a marked Polish LU occurs in plWordNet but its counterpart is not in PWN, or even cannot be lexicalised in English. Now inter-register I-synonymy is next after I-synonymy. The same applies to inter-lingual partial synonymy, when there is a partial overlap of meaning and structure between the source and target synsets. The overlap is immediately visible, so partial synonymy can be assigned right after dismissing full synonymy. When neither Isynonymy applies, I-hyponymy is considered (it has turned out to be the most frequent I-relation), then I-hypernymy, I-meronymy and I-holonymy. Manual mapping onto PWN is also an opportunity to verify plWordNet’s content and structure, and repair errors. Linguists who did not create some part of plWordNet take a second look at it. The mapping procedure (Rudnicka et al., 2012) relies on the comparison of the relation structures for the corresponding synsets, so potential flaws in the hypernymy structure on either side can be discovered, especially because WordnetLoom visualises such structures (many levels down and up). The overall workload doubles in practice. Manual mapping takes nearly as long as wordnet construction, but if it includes verification then result is a lexical resource which allows a deep comparison of the two lexical resources on a very large scale. The whole plWordNet 3.0 will be mapped onto 3.1 (Rudnicka et al., 2012; et al., 2013), and differences in lexical coverage will likely be a problem. A virtual supplement to Princeton WordNet 3.1 may be necessary to make the mapping work for Polish material not present yet on the English side (and give a boost to future multilingual applications). Gaps and discrepancies will be recorded and presented to the Princeton WordNet team. The mapping has thus far focussed on nouns. Extending it to verbs and adjectives may require a revised procedure. 3.4 The ontology In plWordNet project we have deliberately kept the wordnet separate from any ontology, although we are aware that such a relationship must be established sooner or later. plWordNet has been built as a faithful description of the Polish lexical system providing an interface between the lexicon and abstract concept structures of an ontology. Ontologies make concepts unambiguous, but natural language does not allow such “luxuries”. Usage constrains meaning, and stylistic register is a case in point. Some lexical-semantic relations can link only words of identical or at least com- Such considerations should be reflected in the wordnet structure. Constraints on registers in plWordNet 2.1 are part of the definitions of selected lexico-semantic relations: hyponymy and hypernymy can only connect words of compatible registers, inter-register synonymy accounts for near-synonymy with a tolerable register difference, and so on. A wordnet’s expressive power rests primarily on the lexico-semantic relations it encodes. One might say that, in the relational paradigm, all supdata, are secondary, but such a strict position would yield wordnets inadequate for applications. Given that ontologies contain a different kind of information, it makes sense to create a mapping from a wordnet to an ontology and thus associate concepts with their lexical embodiment. Clearly, there is much linguistic knowledge not expressible by lexico-semantic relations, but it could appear in resources of other way of illustration, two Polish words mean ‘girl’, only stylistically neutral, while strongly marked as colloquial. types linked to wordnets, such as syntactic and semantic valency frames (Hajnicz, 2012). In theory, any ontology would work with plWordNet, but SUMO (Pease, 2011) ought to be favoured. There is a mapping from PWN (Peace and Fellbaum, 2010), and other wordnets linked to it are linked to SUMO at least indirectly. The manually constructed plWordNet-to- PWN mapping will help automate SUMO linking. I-synonymy links can be unambiguously mapped over. In other cases, ambiguity causes trou- I-hypernymy and instances of SUMO hyponymy. Synsets in plWordNet and abstract SUMO concepts may have to be linked manually. The ontology mapping will enable the construction of an advanced shallow-semantic parser for Polish which builds a partial semantic representation from concepts acquired in SUMO via plWordNet. The ontology mapping will also facilitate linking plWordNet 3.0 to the Global WordNet and will support the building of multilingual resources and applications. 4 The expectations The construction of plWordNet 3.0 has started in July 2013. Complete plWordNet hypernymy branches are mapped to PWN in parallel by people other than those who built those branches. We expect plWordNet 3.0 to become a comprehenwordnet lemmas) and one of the largest ever Polish dictionaries of any kind. The whole toolkit of semantic resources, completed by the end of 2015, will include plWordNet 3.0, a dynamic lexicon of 2.5 million PNs linked to plWordNet, a mapping plWordNet-PWN and a mapping of plWordNet to the top-level SUMO ontology plus selected medium-level ontologies. The lexico-syntactic structure of plWordNet MWEs (at least 60,000 lemmas) will be described in an associated resource. The toolkit will also be integrated with a syntactico-semantic valence lexicon. The whole complex system of resources and MWE and PN extraction), developed for the needs of the CLARIN project, is intended to be a strong, universal basis for applicaand for further resources and tools, wordnet-based lexical similarity measure. The modularly constructed toolkit will have a layered architecture of large software systems. 67 Different layers of lexical knowledge will be sepbut linked, relational description of lexical meaning in a wordnet and its formal interpretation in an ontology, or lexical meaning and facts represented by PNs. Each layer is based on limited set of notions and principles, can be used separately and upgraded.</abstract>

Languages change continually, so lexicographers never rest, but one can still ask when the development of a wordnet ought to slow down, and whether there is an appropriate steady state of a wordnet. That clearly is a loaded question, and much depends on the language. For example, suppose that a wordnet for 1PWN began as a test of a theory of human semantic representation and memory (Collins and Quillian, 1969). It now features a comprehensive vocabulary, a set of universally useful semantic relations, glosses, links to ontologies, and more. a richly inflected language with complex and varied derivation was originally a translation of PWN. Such a wordnet should, sooner or later, acquire semantic relations which account accurately for its unique lexical system.. A wordnet, even as developed as PWN, GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) or plWordNet (Maziarz et al., 2013a), serves many natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet it seems neither feasible nor necessary to remake wordnets into unive</context>

There is a mapping from PWN (Peace and Fellbaum, 2010), and other wordnets linked to it are linked to SUMO at least indirectly. The manually constructed plWordNet-toPWN mapping will help automate SUMO linking. I-synonymy links can be unambiguously mapped over. In other cases, ambiguity causes trouble, e.g., between I-hypernymy and instances of SUMO hyponymy. Synsets in plWordNet and abstract SUMO concepts may have to be linked manually.

With effective MWE detection, a very large corpus is the most reliable source of MWEs, but (inconveniently) morphological analysis handles their elements separately. We will expand the dictionary of lexico-morphosyntactic MWE structures from (Kurc et al., 2012) to more than 60000 MWEs in a separate resource linked to plWordNet 3.0. 3.2 Proper names We treat proper names (PNs) as separate from the lexicon: very few PNs are present in general dictionaries. That is why they do not belong in lexicosemantic resources. In particular, hyponymy does not really apply. An entity denoted by a PN is an instance of a type. PNs are primarily characterised by their referents, not by their semantic properties revealed in use examples. One must know the referent of the given PN in order to to interpret it unambiguously.

As to argument 2: selected PNs are described in plWordNet because they are the derivational bases from which certain classes of frequent nouns and adjectives are derived, cf (Maziarz et al., 2011). Such PNs are part of the wordnet and are linked by plWordNet instance/type relations. Argument 1 is even more important for us. We plan to describe semantically a very large number of PNs, and do it semi-automatically based on the information extracted from a large corpus (Kurc et al., 2013). Such information can support linking to a wordnet, but not directly to an ontology. Definite noun phrases are also used as anaphoric expressions to refer to and substitute PNs. Heads of such NPs are types for the substituted PNs or hypernyms of the proper types. That is yet another argument for linking PNs to an ontology via the wordnet as an intermediary. A PN semantic lexicon will then be a separate resource linked to plWordNet 3.0 and through it to an ontology – more below. We will build up to 2.5 million Polish PNs an existing resource of 1.4 million.12 The number of semantic categories </context>

PWN’s structure was shaped by the lexicosemantic dependencies among words, not by formal properties of an ontology structure.2 Corpus analysis can help recognise lexicosemantic relations for inclusion in a wordnet. Practical substitution tests can be formulated for individual relations without committing to any particular theory of lexical semantic or human cognition, in the spirit of minimal commitment (Maziarz et al., 2013b).

For example, the same morpheme can be used to create forms of different meanings, so in each case we describe a different specific lexico-semantic relation rather than the formal dependencies among word forms (Piasecki et al., 2012b). When we wrote precise definitions and substitution tests, we realised that several factors systematically constrain linking large sub-classes of LUs by lexico-semantic relations. Three of those factors, stylistic registers, verb aspect and semantic verb classes, apply frequently enough to allow explicit treatment in the relation definitions (Maziarz et al., 2013b). They refer to the properties of LUs, so we call them constitutive features. Relations strictly limited to verbs of the same aspect and semantic class include hyponymy and several specific entailment relations such as inchoativity. Registers explain many situations when pragmatic limitations prevent LUs with the same denotation from being used in the same contexts. Such LUs do share some relations, so constraining relation definitions by register compatibility helps shape the wordnet structure consistently.

Some of those elements will be aligned with plWordNet, and there will be a mapping onto Princeton WordNet. Several challenging applications will show the utility of the toolkit in practice. 1 How wordnets evolve Wordnets start small but quickly grow to account for much of the lexical material of the given language. The size of version 3.1 of Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) is a de facto standard, even if this mature wordnet also keeps growing, albeit slowly.1 One of the resources which approach this size standard is plWordNet (Piasecki et al., 2009), now in version 2.1. Languages change continually, so lexicographers never rest, but one can still ask when the development of a wordnet ought to slow down, and whether there is an appropriate steady state of a wordnet. That clearly is a loaded question, and much depends on the language. For example, suppose that a wordnet for 1PWN began as a test of a theory of human semantic representation and memory (Collins and Quillian, 1969). It now features a comprehensive vocabulary, a set of universally useful semantic relations, glosses, links to ontologies, and more. a richly inflected language wit</context>

Software tools facilitate corpus browsing and semi-automatic knowledge extraction (Piasecki et al., 2009). Dictionaries and encyclopedias are consulted in order, if necessary. This rigorous procedure limits the variability of editing decisions by circumscribing the role of linguistic intuition, though intuition still has its place as a final recourse. A wordnet based very closely on language data is easier to develop when its primitive is a linguistically motivated construct: the lemma-sense pair which we call the lexical unit (LU). The plWordNet model, described in detail in (Maziarz et al., 2013b), considers lexico-semantic relations between LUs. LUs are grouped into synsets if they share lexic</context>

Measures of semantic relatedness tend to be useless for lemmas appearing less than 50 times in a corpus of more than 1 billion tokens (Piasecki et al., 2009). That said, it is unrealistic to aim for a wordnet with full coverage of a frequency list based on a very large corpus. It is hard to say just how many words there are in a language, never mind newest coinage. Corpora, even huge, are not complete enough (Kornai, 2002; Gale and Sampson, 1995, p. 218).

That is to say. we want to interlace theory and practice. 2 The cornerstone 2.1 The model of plWordNet There is a rather unfortunate tendency to treat wordnets as a substitute for ontologies (which are perhaps less well known and less easily available to the NLP community), but significant differences are clear when one compares an ontology with a wordnet understood as a lexico-semantic resource (Prévot et al., 2010). A systems of concepts in a wordnet must be expressed entirely in a natural language – unlike ontologies. A strict knowledge representation is required in an ontology, but a wordnet works through words. The inherent ambiguity of the lexical material makes very formal definitions infeasible. In particular, synonymy is a matter of degree, while concepts in an ontology should be defined with certainty. A rigorous construction of an ontology is not easy insofar as language intuitions “get in the way”.

The PN lexicon is meant to be dynamic: it will be automatically expanded given any new corpus for a specific domain. 3.3 Wordnets and mapping Unlike many other national wordnets constructed by the transfer and merge method, plWordNet has been built independently of PWN. That was a conscious choice motivated by the desire to offer a faithful description of a lexico-semantic system of Polish language, uninfluenced by the structure and 12See http://nlp.pwr.wroc.pl/pl/ narzedzia-i-zasoby/nelexicon content of PWN. Only when the core of plWordNet was constructed did we start its mapping to PWN (Rudnicka et al., 2012; K˛edzia et al., 2013), noting a number of contrasts resulting from differences between lexical systems of English and Polish (e.g., lexical gaps, lexicalised grammatical categories, different structuring of information) as well as in the content and structural design of the two networks. The development of plWordNet 2.0 was independent of PWN (other than its evident influence as a general model). The mapping to PWN was manual, bottom-up, for selected domains – person, artefact, location, time, food and communication (Rudnicka et al., 2012). It was extended in plWordNet 2.1 to round out the c</context>

The overlap is immediately visible, so partial synonymy can be assigned right after dismissing full synonymy. When neither Isynonymy applies, I-hyponymy is considered (it has turned out to be the most frequent I-relation), then I-hypernymy, I-meronymy and I-holonymy. Manual mapping onto PWN is also an opportunity to verify plWordNet’s content and structure, and repair errors. Linguists who did not create some part of plWordNet take a second look at it. The mapping procedure (Rudnicka et al., 2012) relies on the comparison of the relation structures for the corresponding synsets, so potential flaws in the hypernymy structure on either side can be discovered, especially because WordnetLoom visualises such structures (many levels down and up). The overall workload doubles in practice. Manual mapping takes nearly as long as wordnet construction, but if it includes verification then result is a lexical resource which allows a deep comparison of the two lexical resources on a very large scale. The whole plWordNet 3.0 will be mapped onto PWN 3.1 (Rudnicka et al., 2012; K˛edzia et al., 2013), </context>

That said, it is unrealistic to aim for a wordnet with full coverage of a frequency list based on a very large corpus. It is hard to say just how many words there are in a language, never mind newest coinage. Corpora, even huge, are not complete enough (Kornai, 2002; Gale and Sampson, 1995, p. 218). One might assess a lower bound of the vocabulary size from existing dictionary sizes, or calculate it analytically with corpus and statistical methods. English is often assumed to have the most words. The Oxford English Dictionary (Simpson, 2013) contains 300k main entries (± lemmas) and 600k word forms, but no freshest neologisms. There are even larger dictionaries: Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal with 430k entries (Nijhoff, 2001) and a 330k dictionary of Grimm brothers (Grimm, 1999); both are contemporary and historical. A comparable Polish dictionary from the early 1900s has 280k entries (Karłowicz et al., 1900–1927; Piotrowski, 2003, p. 604). Modern dictionaries of general Polish have fewer entries: 130k (Zgółkowa, 1994–2005), 125k (180k LUs) (Doroszewski, 1963–1969), 100k (150k LUs) (Dubisz, 2004), 45k (100k LUs) (Ba´nko, 2000</context>

Biomedical relations play an important role in
biological processes. In this work, we combine
information filtering, grammar parsing and
network analysis for gene-disease association
extraction. The proposed method first extracts
sentences potentially containing information about
gene-diseases interactions based on maximum
entropy classifier with topic features. And then
Probabilistic Context—Free Grammars is applied
for gene-disease association extraction. The
network of genes and the disease is constituted by
the extracted interactions, network centrality
metrics are used for calculating the importance of
each gene. We used breast cancer as testing disease
for system evaluation. The 31 top ranked genes and
diseases by the weighted degree, betweenness, and
closeness centralities have been checked relevance
with breast cancer through NCBI database. The
evaluation showed 83.9% accuracy for the testing
genes and diseases, 74.2% accuracy for the testing
genes.

Since the start of Human Genome Project in
1990, over 40 kinds of organism genome have
been sequenced. Biological databases expand
rapidly with the exponential growth of biological
data. For instance, until now, over 260,000
named organisms have their nucleotide
sequences in the GenBank (Benson et al. 2008)
which integrates data from the major DNA and
protein sequence. However, data is not
information. Compared with situations before
2003, the key problem today has turned to
methods of knowledge extraction. Understanding
the role of genetics in diseases is one of the
major goals of the post-genome era. The
expanding rate of knowledge in gene—disease

associations can hardly match up with the growth
of biological data. It takes time before new
discoveries are included in the databases such as
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM),
and most of the information represented in these
databases is manually collected from literature.
To address this challenge, we proposed an
automatic gene-disease association extraction
approach based on text mining and network
analysis. We combine information filtering,
grammar parsing and network analysis. We
started by calculating main topics of each
sentences in the corpus based on supervised
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) model (Blei
and McAuliffe 2007). The most probable topics
derived from sLDA model for each sentence are
used as features for training maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) (Manning and Schutze, 1999)
classifier, which extracts sentences potentially
containing information about gene-diseases
interactions. After that, Probabilistic Context—
Free Grammars (PCFGs) (Klein and Christopher
2003) is applied for sentence grammar parsing.
Based on the syntactic tree of each sentence, we
extract paths between specific entities such as
diseases or genes. The network of all candidate
genes and the disease is constituted by the
interactions extracted from the sentences in the
corpus. Our main hypothesis in network analysis
is that the most important and the most central
genes in an interaction network are most likely to
be related to the disease. Last, network centrality
metrics are used for calculating the importance
of each gene.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 surveys related work. In Section 3, we
introduce the proposed approach of extracting
interactions from literature. Section 4 presents
gene-disease interaction network analysis. And

Much effort is currently spent on extracting
gene--disease associations (Ozgur et al. 2008;
Chun et al. 2006). Biomedical relation extraction
techniques basically include two branches:
interaction database based methods and text
mining methods. Interaction database based
methods rely on the availability of interaction
databases, such as OMIM, MINT (Zanzoni et al.
2002), IntAct (Kerrien et al. 2012), BIND (Bader
et al. 2003), which predict interactions between
entities using sequence, structural, or
evolutionary information (Krallinger, Leitner,
and Valencia 2010). Although these databases
host a large collection of manually extracted
interactions from the literature, manually curated
databases require considerable effort and time
with the rapid increasing of biomedical literature.
Since most biological facts are available in
the free text of biomedical articles, the wealth of
interaction information provided in biomedical
articles motivated the implementation of text
mining approaches to automatically extract
biomedical relations. Text mining approaches to
gene--disease association extraction have shown
an evolution from simple systems that rely solely
on co-occurrence statistics (Adamic et al. 2002;
Al-Mubaid and Singh 2005) to complex systems
utilizing natural language processing techniques
and machine learning algorithms (Freudenberg
and Propping 2002; Glenisson et al. 2004; Ozgur
et al. 2008). Well-known tools for discovering
gene--disease associations include DAVID
(Huang et al. 2009), GSEA (Subramanian et al.
2005), GOToolBox (Martin et al. 2004), rcNet
(Huang et al. 2011) and many others. However,
in many cases, since the existing annotations of
disease-causative genes is far from complete
(McKusick 2007), and a gene set might only
contain a short list of poorly annotated genes,
existing approaches often fail to reveal the
associations between gene sets and disease
phenotypes (Huang et al. 2011).
Network-based approaches (Wuchty, Oltvai,
and Barabasi, 2003; Schwikowski et al. 2000;
Chen et al. 2006) is performed by assessing how
much genes interact together and are close to
known disease genes in protein networks.
Relation extraction among genes is the
fundamental step for gene-interaction network
creation. Recently, syntactic analysis has been
considered for relation extraction, and different
parsing grammars have been applied. Temkin
and Gilder (2003) used a full parser with a
lexical analyzer and a context free grammar
(CFG) to extract protein-protein interactions. In
Yakushiji et al. (2005)&apos;s work, they proposed a
protein-protein interaction extraction system
based on head-driven phrase structure grammar
(HPSG). Although the pattern generation is
complicated, the performance is not satisfactory.
In addition, dependency grammar is used
frequently in this domain. Erkan et al. (2007)
proposed a semi-supervised classification for
extracting protein interaction sentences using
dependency parsing. Katrin et al. (2007) defined
some rules based on dependency parse tree for
relation extraction. The problem of those systems
using dependency parse is that they cannot treat
non-local dependencies, and thus rules acquired
from the constructions are partial (Yakushiji et al.
2005). Differently, in this work, we apply
sentence filtering based on topics and phrase
structure parsing for relation extraction. The
extracted sentences potentially contain
information about gene-diseases interactions.
Phrase structure grammars are based on the
constituency relation, as opposed to the
dependency relation associated with dependency
grammars. Phrase structure parsing is full
parsing, which takes into account the full
sentence structure.
In addition, many researches (Aerts et al.
2005; Chen et al. 2009; Ma et al. 2007; Hutz et al.
2008; Morrison et al. 2005; Ozgur et al. 2008)
used an initial list of seed genes to build a
disease-specific gene-interaction network, and
thus they are biased in favor of the seed genes,
consequently the results also depend on the
pickup seed genes.

<bodyText confidence="0.989958857142857">
We applied MaxEnt classifier with topic features
for key sentences extraction. The extracted
sentences potentially contain information about
genes and breast cancer interactions.
A Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model
was used to infer topics of sentences. Three most
probable topics of each sentence were put into
trained MaxEnt classifier as features for
extracting sentences that potentially contain
interaction relationship between genes and
diseases.
3.2.1 Key words annotation
We assume that each sentence indicating
interactions should contain at least one gene and
target disease name. Key words are the words
increasing possibility of sentence containing
interaction relationships, such as genes and
diseases. As mentioned above, we built the gene
name dictionary with data from OMIM database
and disease name dictionary from Genetic
Association Database (GAD). All gene names
and disease names were considered as key words.
3.2.2 Topic model based on Gibbs Sampling
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was applied
based on Gibbs Sampling method in our system.
Compared with algorithm obtaining approximate
maximum-likelihood estimates for topics-words
distribution and the hyperparameters of the prior
on documents-topics distribution given by Blei,
Ng and Jordan (2002), Gibbs Sampling method
doesn&apos;t need to explicitly represent the model
parameters which effect on the final results
(Griffiths, 2002).

possibility it belongs to topic j can be given by :

count of words in document d; not including the
current one. α and β are hyperparameters that
determine extent of smooth of this empirical
distribution, and how heavily this distribution
can be chosen to give the desired resolution in
the resulting distribution. W stands for count of
words while T stands for count of topics.
3.2.3 Training of topic model
We randomly selected sentences from 8000
documents in our corpus as training set and set
number of topics as 10. Topic that contains most
words in gene name dictionary and disease name
dictionary was treated as a key topic. Then we
manually assigned each word in gene name
dictionary or disease name dictionary to key
topic, and each word doesn&apos;t belong to the two
dictionaries was assigned to the most probable
topic of itself.
3.2.4 Prediction of key sentences
The sentences containing interactions among
genes or diseases were marked as `Key&apos; and
others were marked as `None&apos;. A MaxEnt
classifier 1 was trained based on the topic
distribution.

<bodyText confidence="0.999165666666667">
As can be seen from Table 3, the rank of
betweenness centrality is approximately matched
with the rank of degree centrality. TNF, EGFR
and CRC are still the highest ranked genes while
IL-6, AR, HR , GAPDH and ATM simply
exchanged their order. AR, androgen receptor,
has a quick raise in the rank list. It plays a vital
role in the development and maintenance of male
reproductive function and the cause of prostate
cancer, but the effect and function on breast
cancer of AR have not been clear until 2010
(most of the literature published before 2010).
This result shows that the genes excavated by our
system not only include genes in the known
interaction network, but also reflect research

tendency at present or in a certain period of time.
This also indicates the effectiveness of
understanding scientific research tendency of our
system.
As the definition of betweenness centrality, it
reflects the ability to affect other nodes in the
network. If a gene interacts with another gene
through an intermediate gene such as suppression
or promotion, then the role played by this
intermediate gene is decisive in this association.
The more intermediate roles played in
associations, the greater the influence of the gene
in the network. Similarly, among all genes in the
neighborhood of a specific gene, the greater the
betweenness centrality of a gene, the more
influence it has on that specific gene.

neighbors increases. There is an approximate
positive correlation between the count of
neighbors and the closeness centrality of nodes
but not so obvious compared with betweenness
centrality or degree centrality. For instance, the
closeness centrality ranges from 0.14 to 0.34 for
nodes with only one neighbor. This tendency
represents that closeness centrality reflect
geographical centricity of each node more
efficiently compared with degree centrality and
betweenness centrality with less dependence on
count of neighbors. For example, if a node has
only one edge to the center of the network, this
node is bound to own large closeness centrality
even though this edge is the only edge it has.
Meanwhile, another node has much more than
one edge but far away from the center of the
network, the closeness centrality of it can never
be larger than the former one. Table 4 lists part

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903263157895">
Understanding the role of genetics in diseases is
one of the major goals of the post-genome era.
We have proposed an automatic gene-disease
association extraction approach based on text
mining and network analysis.
Gene-breast cancer interaction network
analysis demonstrated that degree, betweenness,
and closeness centralities can estimate disease
related genes effectively. And closeness
centrality is able to find disease related genes
which are not obvious ranked by degree
centrality and betweenness centrality. In addition,
this result showed that the genes excavated by
our system not only include genes in the known
interaction network, but also reflect research
tendency at present or in a certain period of time.
This also indicates the effectiveness of
understanding scientific research tendency of our
system.

In this work, we combine information filtering, grammar parsing and network analysis for gene-disease association extraction. The proposed method first extracts sentences potentially containing information about gene-diseases interactions based on maximum entropy classifier with topic features. And then Probabilistic Context—Free Grammars is applied for gene-disease association extraction. The network of genes and the disease is constituted by the extracted interactions, network centrality metrics are used for calculating the importance of each gene. We used breast cancer as testing disease for system evaluation. The 31 top ranked genes and diseases by the weighted degree, betweenness, and closeness centralities have been checked relevance with breast cancer through NCBI database.

Well-known tools for discovering gene--disease associations include DAVID (Huang et al. 2009), GSEA (Subramanian et al. 2005), GOToolBox (Martin et al. 2004), rcNet (Huang et al. 2011) and many others.

It takes time before new discoveries are included in the databases such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and most of the information represented in these databases is manually collected from literature. To address this challenge, we proposed an automatic gene-disease association extraction approach based on text mining and network analysis. We combine information filtering, grammar parsing and network analysis. We started by calculating main topics of each sentences in the corpus based on supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA) model (Blei and McAuliffe 2007). The most probable topics derived from sLDA model for each sentence are used as features for training maximum entropy (MaxEnt) (Manning and Schutze, 1999) classifier, which extracts sentences potentially containing information about gene-diseases interactions.

Biomedical relation extraction techniques basically include two branches: interaction database based methods and text mining methods. Interaction database based methods rely on the availability of interaction databases, such as OMIM, MINT (Zanzoni et al. 2002), IntAct (Kerrien et al. 2012), BIND (Bader et al. 2003), which predict interactions between entities using sequence, structural, or evolutionary information (Krallinger, Leitner, and Valencia 2010). Although these databases host a large collection of manually extracted interactions from the literature, manually curated databases require considerable effort and time with the rapid increasing of biomedical literature. Since most biological facts are available in the free text of biomedical articles, the wealth of interaction information provided in biomedical articles motivated the implementati</context>

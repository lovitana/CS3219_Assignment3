We consider how to develop types cor-
responding to propositions and questions.
Starting with the conception of Proposi-
tions as Types, we consider two empirical
challenges for this doctrine. The first re-
lates to the putative need for a single type
encompassing questions and propositions
in order to deal with Boolean operations.
The second relates to adjectival modifica-
tion of question and propositional entities.
We partly defuse the Boolean challenge
by showing that the data actually argue
against a single type covering questions
and propositions. We show that by ana-
lyzing both propositions and questions as
records within Type Theory with Records
(TTR), we can define Boolean operations
over these distinct semantic types. We ac-
count for the adjectival challenge by em-
bedding the record types defined to deal
with Boolean operations within a theory of
semantic frames formulated within TTR.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978389041666667">
Propositions as types has long been viewed as a
sine qua non of many a type theoretic approach to
semantics (see e.g., the seminal work of (Ranta,
1994)). Although this has lead to a variety of
very elegant formal accounts, one can question its
appropriateness as a type for NL propositions—
the denotata of declaratives and of nouns such as
‘claim’ and the objects of assertion. One imme-
diate issue concerns semantic selection—how to
specify the semantic types of predicates such as
‘believe’ and ‘assert’ so that they will not select
for e.g., the type of biscuits or the type of natural
numbers, given their inappropriateness as objects
of belief or assertion. However, one resolves this
issue, we point to two other significant challenges:
1. Recently there have been a number of pro-
posals that questions and propositions are of a
single ontological category (see (Nelken and
Francez, 2002; Nelken and Shan, 2006)) and
most influentially work in Inquisitive Seman-
tics (IS) (Groenendijk and Roelofsen, 2009).
A significant argument for this is examples
like (1), where propositions and questions
can apparently be combined by boolean con-
nectives.
(1) If Kim is not available, who should
we ask to give the talk?
In Inquisitive Semantics, such data are han-
dled by postulating a common type for ques-
tions and propositions as sets of sets of
worlds. It is not a priori clear how propo-
sitions as types can account for such cases.
2. Adjectives pose a challenge to all existing
theories of questions and propositions, pos-
sible worlds based (e.g., (Karttunen, 1977;
Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1997; Groenendijk
and Roelofsen, 2009), or type theoretic, as in
Type Theory with Records (TTR, (Cooper,
2012; Ginzburg, 2012)). There is nothing
in the semantic entity associated with a po-
lar question as in (2), be it a two cell parti-
tion (as in partition semantics) or a constant
function from records into propositions (as in
Ginzburg 2012) that will allow it to distin-
guish difficult from easy questions. Similarly,
since the denotation of a question is not con-
ceived as an event, this denotation is not ap-
propriate for the adjective quick:
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.957750857142857">
And yet, these two distinct classes of adjec-
tives can simultaneously apply to a question
together with ‘resolved’, a target of all exist-
ing theories of questions, as in (3), calling for
a unified notion of question:
(3) The quick question you just posed
is difficult and for the moment unre-
solved.
‘Difficult’ and ‘silly’ apply to both proposi-
tional and question entities, suggesting the
need for a unified meaning for the adjective
and a means of specifying its selection so
that it can modify both questions and propo-
sitions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9970718">

b. silly question (a question silly to
ask);
c. difficult claim (a claim difficult to

<bodyText confidence="0.998460363636364">
In this paper we partly defuse the Boolean
challenge by showing that the data actually ar-
gue against a single type covering questions and
propositions. We show that by analyzing both
propositions and questions as records within TTR,
we can define Boolean operations over these dis-
tinct semantic types. We then propose to deal
with the adjectival challenge by embedding the
types initially defined within a theory of semantic
frames (Fillmore, 1985; Pustejovsky, 1995) for-
mulated within TTR.

2 Questions and Propositions: a unified
semantic type?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998315">
Although there has been a recent trend to assume
a commonality of type for questions and propo-
sitions, both Hamblin and Karttunen gave argu-
ments for distinguishing questions as an ontologi-
cal category from propositions—(Hamblin, 1958)
pointing out that interrogatives lack truth values;
to which one can add their incompatibility with a
wider scoping alethic modality:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8541478">
(5) a. It’s true/false who came yesterday
b. # Necessarily, who will leave tomorrow?
Whereas (Karttunen, 1977) pointed to the exis-
tence of predicates that select interrogatives, but
not for declaratives and vice versa:
(6) a. Bo asked/investigated/wondered/#
believed /# claimed who came yesterday.
b. Bo # asked/# investigated/# wondered/
believed /claimed that Mary came yester-
day.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994912470588235">
We argue that although speech acts involving
questions and propositions can be combined by
boolean connectives they are not closed under
boolean operations. Furthermore, we argue that
the propositions and questions qua semantic ob-
jects cannot be combined by boolean operations
at all. This, together with the examples above,
strongly suggests that questions and propositions
are distinct types of semantic objects.
We use embedding under attitude verbs as a test
for propositions and questions as semantic objects.
Here we do not find mixed boolean combinations
of questions and propositions. Thus, for exam-
ple, wonder selects for an embedded question and
believe for an embedded proposition but a mixed
conjunction does not work with either, showing
that it is neither a question nor a proposition:

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98596895">
The verb know is compatible with both
interrogative and declarative complements,
though(Vendler, 1972; Ginzburg and Sag, 2000)
argue that such predicates do not take questions or
propositions as genuine arguments (i.e. not purely
referentially), but involve coercions which leads
to a predication of a fact. The well formedness
of these coercion processes require that sentences
involving decl/int conjunctions such as (8) can
only be understood where the verb is distributed
over the two conjuncts: “knows that John’s smart
and knows what qualifications he has”:
(8) The manager knows that John’s smart and
what qualifications he has.
Compare (9a,b)—in the second mixed case
there is only a reading which entails that it is sur-
prising the conference was held at the usual time
whereas arguably in the first sentence only the
conjunction but not the individual conjuncts need
be surprising.

a. The manager wonders whether, if Hol-
lande left, we need to clean the west wing.
Why, then, do apparent mixed boolean com-
binations appear in root sentences? Our answer
is that natural language connectives, in addition
to their function as logical connectives combin-
ing propositions, can be used to combine speech
acts into another single speech act. This, however,
can only be expressed in root sentences and speech
acts are not closed under operations correspond-
ing to boolean connectives. For example in (11a),
where a query follows an assertion is fine whereas
the combination of an assertion with a preceding
query is not, as in (11b):
(11) a. John’s very smart but does he have any
qualifications?
b. *Does John have any qualifications
and/but he’s smart
This is puzzling because a discourse corre-
sponding to a string of the same separate speech
acts works well:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.874466">
(12) Does John have any qualifications? (no
answer) But he’s smart.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999700625">
Similarly, while we can apparently conditionalize
a query with a proposition, we cannot conditional-
ize an assertion with a question, nor can we condi-
tionalize a query with a question:
However we treat these facts, it seems clear that
it would be dangerous to collapse questions and
propositions into the same type of semantic object
and allow general application of semantic boolean
operators. This would seem to force you into a sit-
uation where you have to predict acceptability of
these sentences purely on the basis of a theory of
syntax, although semantically/pragmatically they
would have made perfect sense. It seems to us that
distinguishing between questions and propositions
and combinations of speech acts offers a more ex-
planatory approach.

3 Austinian Types for Propositions and
Questions

3.1 TTR as synthesizing Constructive Type
Theory and Situation Semantics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989571428572">
The system we sketch is formulated in TTR
(Cooper, 2012). TTR is a framework that draws its
inspirations from two quite distinct sources. One
source is Constructive Type Theory, whence the
repertory of type constructors, and in particular
records and record types, and the notion of wit-
nessing conditions. The second source is situa-
tion semantics (Barwise and Perry, 1983; Barwise,
1989) which TTR follows in viewing semantics as
ontology construction. This is what underlies the
emphasis on specifying structures in a model the-
oretic way, introducing structured objects for ex-
plicating properties, propositions, questions etc. It
also takes from situation semantics an emphasis on
partiality as a key feature of information process-
ing. This aspect is exemplified in a key assumption
of TTR—the witnessing relation between records
and record types: the basic relationship between
the two is that a record r is of type RT if each
value in r assigned to a given label lz satisfies the
typing constraints imposed by RT on lz:

This allows for cases where there are fields in
the record with labels not mentioned in the record
type. This is important when e.g., records are used
to model contexts and record types model rules
about context change—we do not want to have to
predict in advance all information that could be
in a context when writing such rules. (15) illus-
trates this: the record (15a) is of the type (15b),
though the former has also a field for FACTS;
(15b) constitutes the preconditions for a greeting,
where FACTS—the contextual presuppositions—
has no role to play.

3.2 Propositions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990775">
Our starting point is the situation semantics no-
tion of an Austinian proposition (Barwise and
Etchemendy, 1987). (Ginzburg, 2012) introduces
Austinian propositions as records of the form:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.98153">
&amp;quot; #
sit = s
(16)
sit-type = T
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9985265">
This gives us a type theoretic object correspond-
ing to a judgement. The type of Austinian proposi-
tions is the record type (17a),where the type Rec-
Type† is a basic type which denotes the type of
(non-dependent) record types closed under meet,
join and negation.1 Truth conditions for Austinian

<footnote confidence="0.6106085">
1When we say ‘the type of record types’, this should be
understood in a relative, not absolute way. That is, this means
the type of record types up to some level of stratification, oth-
erwise foundational problems such as russellian paradoxes
can potentially ensue. See (Cooper, 2012) for discussion and
a more careful development.
</footnote>

propositions are defined in (17b):

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.985348">
We introduce negative types by the clause in
(18a). Motivated in part by data concerning nega-
tive perception complements ((Barwise and Perry,
1983; Cooper, 1998), we can characterize wit-
nesses for negative types by (18b).

also the following specification:

b. a : T V -,T is not necessary (a may not be

Thus this negation is a hybrid of classical and
intuitionistic negation in that (19a) normally holds
for classical negation but not intuitionistic whereas
(19b), that is failure of the law of the excluded
middle, normally holds for intuitionistic negation
but not classical negation.

3.3 Questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990392">
Extensive motivation for the view of questions
as propositional abstracts has been provided in
(Ginzburg, 1995; Ginzburg and Sag, 2000)—TTR
contributes to this by providing an improved no-
tion of simultaneous, restricted abstraction: A (ba-
sic, non-compound) question is a function from
records into propositions. In particular, a polar
question is a 0-ary propositional abstract, which
in TTR makes it a constant function from the uni-
verse of all records into propositions. We pro-
pose a refinement of this view which we believe
maintains the essential insights of the proposi-
tional function approach, motivated in part by the
need to enable conjunction and disjunction to be
defined for questions.
We introduce a notion of Austinian questions
defined as records containing a record and a func-
tion into record types, the latter associated with
the label ‘abstr(act)’. The role of wh-words on
this view is to specify the domains of these func-
tions; in the case of polar questions there is no re-
striction, hence the function component of such a
question is a constant function. (21) exemplifies
this for a unary ‘who’ question and a polar ques-
tion:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9841447">
(2 1) a. Who = x1 : Ind ; Whether = Rec;
�c1 : person(x1)
b. ‘Who runs’ H
⎡sit =r1
⎣[ ]
abstr = Ar:Who( c : run(r.x1) )
c. ‘Whether Bo runs’ H
⎡sit =r1
⎣[ ]
abstr = Ar:Whether( c : run(b) )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994066">
We characterize the type AustQuestion within
TTR by means of the parametric type given in
(22); the parametric component of the type char-
acterizes the range of abstracts that build up ques-
tions:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.986372">
(22) AustQuestion(T) =def
� �
sit : Rec
abstr : (T —* RecType)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.898673666666667">
Given this, we define the following relation be-
tween a situation and a function, which is the ba-
sis for defining key coherence answerhood no-
tions such as resolvedness and aboutness (weak
partial answerhood (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000))
and question dependence (cf. erotetic implica-
tion,(Wi´sniewski, 2001)):
(23) s resolves q, where q is Ar : (T1)T2, (in
symbols s?q) iff either

(i) for some a : T1 s : q(a),
or
(ii) a : T1 implies s : -,q(a)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9890176">
Austinian questions can be conjoined and dis-
joined though not negated. The definition for
conj/disj-unction, from which it follows that q1
and (or) q2 is resolved iff q1 is resolved and (or)
q2 is resolved, is as follows:

Following (Cooper and Ginzburg, 2012)) we ar-
gue that “negative questions” involve questions re-
lating to negative propositions rather than nega-
tions of positive questions. As Cooper and
Ginzburg show, such negative questions are cru-
cially distinct from the corresponding positive
question. Since we have a clear way of distin-
guishing negative and positive propositions, we do
not conflate positive and negative polar questions.

Nonetheless, not all cases of successive ques-
tions do involve a second question which is a sub-
question of the first, as exemplified in (26):
(26) On the substantive front, we now have
preliminary answers to two key ques-
tions: What did the agency do wrong?
And who ordered it to target conservative
groups? Notwithstanding Miller’s resig-
nation, which the President himself an-
nounced on Tuesday evening, the answers
appear to be: not nearly as much as re-
cent headlines suggest; and, nobody in
the Obama Administration. (The New
Yorker, May 16, 2013)
In contrast to cases covered by QSPEC, these
cases are strange if the second question is posed
by the addressee of the first question—one gets the
feeling that the original question was ignored:

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99443036">
How to deal with adjectival modification of propo-
sitional and question entities, exemplified in (3,4)
above? The extended notion of question required
can be explicated within Cooper 2012’s theory
of semantic frames, inspired by (Fillmore, 1985;
Pustejovsky, 1995). Neither Ty2 (Groenendijk and
Stokhof, 1997) nor inquisitive semantics in propo-
sitional or first order formulation support the de-
velopment of such an ontology. Cooper formu-
lates a frame as a record type (RT). In (29) we
exemplify a possible frame for question. Here,
the illoc role represents a question’s role in dis-
course, whereas the telic role describes the goal of
the process associated with resolving a question
— finding a resolving answer. The frame repre-
sents a ‘default’ view of a question, which vari-
ous in effect non-subsective adjectives can modify
(e.g., ‘unspoken question’ negates the existence
of an associated utterance, while ‘open question’
negates the end point of the resolution event).2
2Here Resolve maps an austinian proposition and an aus-
tinian question to a predicate type. In a more detailed account
one would add an additional argument for an information
state, given the arguments that this notion is agent–relative
(Ginzburg, 1995) and much subsequent literature.

A type-driven compositional analysis is for-
mulated with adjectives as record type modifiers
(functions from RTs to RTs) that pick out frame el-
ements of the appropriate type (for a related view
cf. Asher &amp; Luo 2012). For example, difficult
question has the record type in (30):

<bodyText confidence="0.9995774">
Records and record types come with a well-
known notion of subtyping, often construed syn-
tactically (see e.g., (Betarte and Tasistro, 1998)).
However, given our ontological perspective on se-
mantics, we take a semantic perspective on sub-
typing (see e.g. (Frisch et al., 2008) for a detailed
exposition of such an approach.), wherein T ❁ T&apos;
iff {s|s : T} C {s|s : T&apos;}. Given this, a record of
the type (29) above can be viewed as also having
type:

<equation confidence="0.6934985">
(31) T : Type
�external : AustQuestion(T)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780444444445">
This forms the basis of our account of how an
adjective such as difficult applies simultaneously
to question and to path. Difficult is specified as
in (32)— a function from record types subsumed
by the record type given in the domain whose
output involves a modification of the restriction
field of the telic role. This yields (32b) when
combined with question and (32c) when combined
with path:3
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.991608">
3Here difficult maps any type P into the predicate type
difficult(P). One probably needs to narrow this specifica-
tion somewhat.

<bodyText confidence="0.996299111111111">
Turning to propositions, we postulate (33) as a
type for proposition. This allows us, for instance,
to specify the adjective silly as modifying along
the illoc dimension, thereby capturing silly claim
(a claim silly to assert) and silly question (a ques-
tion silly to ask); given the specification of the telic
dimension and our lexical entry for difficult, diffi-
cult claim is correctly predicted to mean ‘a claim
difficult to prove’.

Subject matter adjectives such as political, per-
sonal, moral, philosophical as in (34) lead us to
another intrinsic advantage for rich type theories
such as TTR over possible worlds based type the-
ories, relating to the types AustQuestion/Prop.

<bodyText confidence="0.93482525">
That’s a moral claim.
Subject matter adjectives target the external role
of a question/proposition. This can be explicated
on the basis of the predicate types which consti-
tute the sit-type (abstr type) field in propositions
(questions). Given the coarse granularity of possi-
ble worlds, it to unclear how to do so in ontologies
based on sets of possible worlds.

<abstract confidence="0.999602695652174">We consider how to develop types corresponding to propositions and questions. with the conception of Proposias we consider two empirical challenges for this doctrine. The first relates to the putative need for a single type encompassing questions and propositions in order to deal with Boolean operations. The second relates to adjectival modification of question and propositional entities. We partly defuse the Boolean challenge by showing that the data actually argue against a single type covering questions and propositions. We show that by analyzing both propositions and questions as records within Type Theory with Records (TTR), we can define Boolean operations over these distinct semantic types. We account for the adjectival challenge by embedding the record types defined to deal with Boolean operations within a theory of semantic frames formulated within TTR.</abstract>

It seems to us that distinguishing between questions and propositions and combinations of speech acts offers a more explanatory approach. 3 Austinian Types for Propositions and Questions 3.1 TTR as synthesizing Constructive Type Theory and Situation Semantics The system we sketch is formulated in TTR (Cooper, 2012). TTR is a framework that draws its inspirations from two quite distinct sources. One source is Constructive Type Theory, whence the repertory of type constructors, and in particular records and record types, and the notion of witnessing conditions. The second source is situation semantics (Barwise and Perry, 1983; Barwise, 1989) which TTR follows in viewing semantics as ontology construction. This is what underlies the emphasis on specifying structures in a model theoretic way, introducing structured objects for explicating properties, propositions, questions etc. It also takes from situation</context>

We show that by analyzing both propositions and questions as records within TTR, we can define Boolean operations over these distinct semantic types. We then propose to deal with the adjectival challenge by embedding the types initially defined within a theory of semantic frames (Fillmore, 1985; Pustejovsky, 1995) formulated within TTR. 2 Questions and Propositions: a unified semantic type? Although there has been a recent trend to assume a commonality of type for questions and propositions, both Hamblin and Karttunen gave arguments for distinguishing questions as an ontological category from propositions—(Hamblin, 1958) pointing out that interrogatives lack truth values; to which one can add their incompatibility with a wider scoping alethic modality: (5) a.

However, given our ontological perspective on semantics, we take a semantic perspective on subtyping (see e.g. (Frisch et al., 2008) for a detailed exposition of such an approach.), wherein T ❁ T&apos; iff {s|s : T} C {s|s : T&apos;}. Given this, a record of the type (29) above can be viewed as also having type: (31) T : Type �external : AustQuestion(T) This forms the basis of our account of how an adjective such as difficult applies simultaneously to question and to path.

Neither Ty2 (Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1997) nor inquisitive semantics in propositional or first order formulation support the development of such an ontology. Cooper formulates a frame as a record type (RT). In (29) we exemplify a possible frame for question. Here, the illoc role represents a question’s role in discourse, whereas the telic role describes the goal of the process associated with resolving a question — finding a resolving answer.

We account for the adjectival challenge by embedding the record types defined to deal with Boolean operations within a theory of semantic frames formulated within TTR. 1 Introduction Propositions as types has long been viewed as a sine qua non of many a type theoretic approach to semantics (see e.g., the seminal work of (Ranta, 1994)).

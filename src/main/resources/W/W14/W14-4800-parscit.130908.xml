Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999818307692308">
Computational Terminology covers an increasingly important aspect in Natural Language Processing
areas such as text mining, information retrieval, information extraction, summarisation, textual
entailment, document management systems, question-answering systems, ontology building, etc.
Terminological information is paramount for knowledge mining from texts for scientific discovery and
competitive intelligence. Scientific needs in fast growing domains (such as biomedicine, chemistry
and ecology) and the overwhelming amount of textual data published daily demand that terminology
is acquired and managed systematically and automatically; while in well established domains (such as
law, economy, banking and music) the demand is on fine-grained analyses of documents for knowledge
description and acquisition. Moreover, capturing new concepts leads to the acquisition and management
of new knowledge.
The aim of this fourth CompuTerm workshop is to bring together Natural Language Processing
researchers to discuss recent advances in computational terminology and its impact in many NLP
applications. The topics addressed in this workshop are wide ranging:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.893070392857143">
• term extraction, recognition and filtering, which is the core of the terminological activity that lays
basis for other terminological topics and tasks;
• event recognition and extraction, that extends the notion of the terminological entity from terms
meaning static units up to terms meaning procedural and dynamic processes;
• acquisition of semantic relations among terms, which is also an important research topic as the
acquisition of semantic relationships between terms finds applications such as the population
and update of existing knowledge bases, definition of domain specific templates in information
extraction and disambiguation of terms;
• term variation management, that helps to deal with the dynamic nature of terms, their acquisition
from heterogeneous sources, their integration, standardisation and representation for a large range
of applications and resources, is also increasingly important, as one has to address this research
problem when working with various controlled vocabularies, thesauri, ontologies and textual data.
Term variation is also related to their paraphrases and reformulations, due to historical, regional,
local or personal issues. Besides, the discovery of synonym terms or term clusters is equally
beneficial to many NLP applications;
• definition acquisition, that covers important research and aims to provide precise and
nonambiguous description of terminological entities. Such definitions may contain elements
necessary for the formal description of terms and concepts within ontologies;
• consideration of the user expertise, that is becoming a new issue in the terminological activity, takes
into account the fact that specialized domains contain notions and terms often nonunderstandable
to non-experts or to laymen (such as patients within the medical area, or bank clients within
banking and economy areas). This aspect, although related to specialized areas, provides direct
link between specialized languages and general language;
• systematic terminology management and updating domain specific dictionaries and thesauri, that
are important aspects for maintaining the existing terminological resources. These aspects become
crucial because the amount of the existing terminological resources is constantly increasing and
because their perennial and efficient use depends on their maintenance and updating, while their
re-acquisition is costly and often non-reproducible;

• monolingual and multilingual resources, that open the possibility for developing cross-lingual
and multi-lingual applications, requires specific corpora, methods and tools which design and
evaluation are challenging issues;
• robustness and portability of methods, which allows to apply methods developed in one given
context to other contexts (corpora, domains, languages, etc.) and to share the research expertise
among them;
• social netwoks and modern media processing, that attracts an increasing number of researchers
and that provides challenging material to be processed;
• utilization of terminologies in various NLP applications, as they are a necessary component of
any NLP system dealing with domain-specific literature, is another novel and challenging research
direction.

In the call for paper, we encouraged authors to submit their research work related to various aspects
of computational terminology, ranging from term extraction in various languages (using verb co-
occurrence, information theoretic approaches, machine learning, etc.), translation pairs extracting from
bilingual corpora based on terminology, up to semantic oriented approaches and theoretical aspects
of terminology. Besides, experiments on the evaluation of terminological methods and tools are also
encouraged since they provide interesting and useful proof about the utility of terminological resources:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.888598428571428">
• direct evaluation may concern the efficiency of the terminological methods and tools to capture the
terminological entities and relations, as well as various kinds of related information;
• indirect evaluation may concern the use of terminological resources in various NLP applications
and the impact these resources have on the performance of the automatic systems. In this case,
research and competition tracks (such as TREC, BioCreative, CLEF, CLEF-eHealth, I2B2, *SEM,
and other shared tasks), provide particularly fruitful evaluation contexts and proved very successful
in identifying key problems in terminology such as term variation and ambiguity.

The Computerm 2014 workshop received 14 submissions from 10 countries and 3 continents addressing
issues on 12 languages. Further to a double-blind peer-review process, 6 papers were accepted for
oral presentations and 7 as posters. The acceptance rate for oral presentations is 40% and the overall
acceptance rate is 86.66%. We believe this workshop will be a nice place for fruitful research discussions,
and the emergence of new research topics and collaborations. The objective of the combined oral and
poster presentations is to strengthen this point.

First of all, we would like to thank the members of the program committee for the quality of their reviews.
We are particularly grateful to Noemie Elhadad for accepting to give an invited talk. We are grateful to
the COLING organizers, in particular Jennifer Foster, John Judge and Joachim Wagner for their help
in the workshop organisation. And last but not the least, we would like to thank all the authors for the
quality of their submission and their hard work. We also thank the participants to the Computerm 2014
workshop. Without all of them, this 4th workshop on Computational Terminology would not take place.

This paper aims at highlighting the com-
plex lexico-semantic information entailed
in Chinese shape classifiers. The study is
based on a selection of the same as derived
from extensive literature. The goal is to
introduce shape information in wordnets
in a comprehensive way starting by shape
classifiers. The suggestion is to map them
not just as information coercers, but also
as lexical items (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
The paper also explores the metaphorical
implications that can be derived from clas-
sifiers in this double function.

Classifiers belong to some of the most com-
plex issues in the grammars of the languages that
own them (e. g. Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai).
The approach to classifiers as not just grammati-
cal, but also lexical items, has already been paved.
(Mok, Huini and Bond, 2012; Paik and Bond,
2002) and (Bond and Paik, 2000) have for instance
conducted research on classifiers and Wordnet®
(WN), mainly focusing on the generation / predic-
tion of classifiers from WN or from a common on-
tology.
In this paper, some Chinese shape classifiers are
taken into account. Upon the claim made in lit-
erature that they enhance shape-related properties
entailed in the nouns they collocate with (as de-
scribed in Section 2), three major claims are made.
(I) Classifiers (as for this study, shape ones) can
trigger shape-related information from the noun
they accompany, but (II) they can also pass the
shape-related information they already contain to
the nouns that follow (which makes this informa-
tion transfer bi-, and not just mono-directional).
In order to understand point II, it needs to be
pointed out that, although classifiers are defined
as morphemes specifying the semantic class of
the nouns that follows, they can be nouns, verbs
and adjectives at the same time (a fact that re-
mains rather unmentioned in the referred litera-
ture). Once this fact is acknowledged, the afore as-
sumed bi-directionality of lexico-semantic infor-
mation from classifier to noun sounds feasible.
In the proposed examples, cases are also shown
in which the liason between classifier and noun
may be shallow (meaning that it is unclear how the
shape-related classifier can possibly match with a
certain noun). For these cases, it is suggested that
(III) the bond between shape classifier and noun
that follows is justifiable through metaphorical ex-
tension.
The author believes that the introduction of
classifiers as elements of meaning derivation and
meaning extension can be of interest for the word-
net community.
All the points in the research stress the need to
consider classifiers and shape-related information
in wordnets in greater detail. The research also
tries to justify the use of classifiers in common-
sense language.
The choice of selecting shape over other kinds
of classifiers, as well as the hypothesis of a
metaphorical justification in their use in language
are inscribed in the bigger frame of current re-
search (Quattri, 2013a; Quattri, 2013b).

2 Shape classifiers as lexico-semantic
information carriers
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99989212">
According to (Huang and Ahrens, 2003), clas-
sifiers coerce information from the noun they ac-
company. This kind of retrieved information helps
to better specify the noun into kind, event or in-
dividual. The authors, together with (Imai, Saal-
bach and Stern, 2010), categorize classifiers ac-
cording to the properties that they extract from
the noun they collocate with, including ShapeAt-
tributes, such as length, or roundness, or flatness.1
Although not explicitly stated, it seems that
other authors apply the similar value to classifiers,
i. e. of being elements that coerce or extract in-
formation from the event or object that comes af-
ter them. For instance, according to ((Sera, John-
son and Yichun, 2013):5–7), the Chinese classi-
fier 條 tiáo reflects the length and flexibility en-
tailed in the objects it carries (e. g. a rope, or a
snake). 支 zhī stresses length and rigidity, while
個 ge is a more universal classifier, thus partly a
shape-related one. For (Sera, Johnson and Yichun,
2013), the use of 條,支 and 個 in Chinese, counts,
among other shape classifiers in their research, for
56.5% of general use.
Once the monodirectionality between classifier
y and noun x is implied, some authors either cate-
gorically deny, or hardly prove,2 the existence of
a hierarchical relations among the different mor-
phemes.
In this paper, a new approach to classifiers is
proposed, with the following assumptions: (I)
Classifiers can trigger information from the noun
they accompany but (II) they are not just mor-
phemes, but also proper words (nouns, verbs and
/ or adjectives) with proper meaning/s. This ac-
knowledged, it is assumed that the meaning that a
classifier coerces from a noun may be contained
in the classifier itself and transferred to the word
it accompanies. (III) When the matching between
classifier and noun appears shallow, there might
exist a metaphorical motivation that enables to jus-
tify the use of that specific morpheme for that spe-
cific noun.
Let’s propose some examples as evidence.
Take for instance the classifier 張 zhāng. When
used as a verb, the word means ‘to spread up’, ‘to
stretch’, ‘to expand’, while when used as a noun
it means ‘string’. Not surprisingly, when acting as
morpheme, 張 accompanies nouns which define
long, flat objects, such as bows, tables, or pieces
of paper (II). Yet, 張 also matches to words like
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9962891">
1The upper ontology SUMO (www.
ontologyportal.com) maps these shape features
differently. Length is for istance mapped as LengthMeasure,
roundness as ShapeAttribute, flatness as VisualAttribute
or SpatialRelation. The author has decided to represent all
these shape-related features as subsumed to the self-defined
upper concept ShapeAttribute (as in fig. 1).
2For reference: Adams and Conklin (1973), Allan (1977),
Croft (1994), Denny (1986), Downing (1996), also cited un-
der ((Imai, Saalbach and Stern, 2010):485ff.)

<bodyText confidence="0.999318163265306">
‘mouth’ (一張嘴 yī zhāngzuǐ) or ballot (一張選
票 yī zhāng xuǎnpiào). One feasible justification
is that both the body part and the vote are visu-
ally synthesized, the first as something flat (sort of
string), the second as the real instrument that en-
ables a vote to be casted. Since both objects stand
in the mental eye for something else, we call them
metaphorical extension of the real meaning, trig-
gered by the classifier 張 (III).
管 (兒) guǎn(r) stands in Chinese for ‘tube’ or
‘pipe’. The word also acts as classifier for tube-
shaped objects, such as flutes and toothpaste tubes.
Literature does not provide a precise specification
of the association of 管 to these nouns, so it maybe
possible to assume that the ShapeAttribute length
is triggered either by the noun (I), or by the classi-
fier (II).
Another case of vagueness in the determination
of what coerces what is provided by the case of 片
piàn. In 一片吐司 yī piàn tǔsī , a piece of bread,
the ShapeAttribute flatness is entailed in, and can
therefore derived from either 片 piàn as word (also
meaning ‘slice’), or from 土司 tǔsī, ‘sliced bread’.
In this uncertainty, one might use this example as
evidence for (I). On the contrary, in the case of
in 一片地 yī piàn dì, a (flat) piece of land, one
can state with almost no doubt that the ShapeAt-
tribute flatness derives from 片 and not from 地
(II), since the latter simply means ‘land’, ‘place’,
‘earth’, ‘ground’.
團 tuán corresponds to the English verb ‘to roll’,
‘to roll into a ball’, ‘to gather’. As a noun, it trans-
lates into ‘regiment’, ‘group’, ‘society’, ‘body’
(which metaphorically can all stand for conglom-
eration of substance, or “mass” of people). As
adjective, 團 stands for ‘circular’, ‘round’, ‘col-
lective’. As a classifier, 團 collocates with round
objects, such as doughs (一團麵團 yī tuán miàn-
tuán).3 Cases like this, where the metaphorical ex-
tension is assumed to be found in the classifier as
a noun, have been marked separately in fig. 1, and
could be considered a further extension of point
(III) (IIIa).
In some cases, metaphorical extensions can be
more than assumed. Their justification may lie in
the lexical derivation that the word / classifier has
inherited from another meaning which conceptu-
ally stands in a higher position (as in the case of a
node-synset relation).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.564468">
3Notice the presence of 團 as suffix of the Chinese word
for ‘dough’, 麵團.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999860625">
One example for these cases is the Chinese cor-
respondent for English ‘tree’, 木 mix. The radical
can be a semantic or a phonetic component. From
木 derive at least four shape classifiers (which
carry 木 in their character): 本 běn, 根 gēn and 株
zhū. When used as proper nouns, all three mean
‘root’. The part_of relation between classifier
and radical is quite straightforward; the metaphor-
ical extension (III) might lie in the fact that from
the physical ‘root’ derives a virtual root, or ‘ba-
sis’, ‘foundation’ (both words count among the
meanings of the three classifiers as nouns). The
metaphorization process does not stop at the level
of radical-classifier, but seems to continue in some
of the expressions generated by the word (e. g. 我
們必須找到問題的根源 wǒmen bìxū zhǎodào
wèntí de gēnyuán, literally “we must find the root
of the problem”, with 根 源 gēnyuán meaning
‘root’ - for ‘cause’ and ‘origin’).
Another important aspect regarding classifiers
that has been noticed from thorough investiga-
tions of several shape ones, is the fact that clas-
sifiers (when acting either as coercer or bor-
rower of shape information) select specific infor-
mation within the wide range of possible ShapeAt-
tribute(s). For instance, although 本 běn, 根 gēn
and 株 zhū are all used as classifiers for plants and
trees, each of them highlight a particular shape,
position, or size of the plants and trees they col-
locate with.
The same observation on selective information
can be drawn from the use, in commonsense lan-
guage, of the word / classifier 顆 kē (e. g. 一颗
西瓜 yī kē xīguā, one melon), when for instance
compared to 粒 lì (e.g. 一 粒 子 彈 yī lì zǐdàn
one bullet). Although both classifiers are used
to enhance the shape attribute of roundness, they
collocate with different sized objects. 顆 classi-
fies “solid round objects” (such as small spheres,
pearls, corn grains, teeth, hearts and satellites),
粒 on the contrary classifies “small round things”
(such as peas, bullets, peanuts, pills, grains).4
Eventually, what needs to be reminded with re-
gards to classifiers (that should be further stressed
in the case shape classifiers are introduced in
wordnets) is their “conceptual polysemy”. An ex-
ample can be 條 tiáo. 條 classifies long, flexi-
ble, bendable objects, both animate and inanimate.

English dictionary, http://cdict.net/

<bodyText confidence="0.999979043478261">
When combined to nouns, this cluster of shape at-
tributes is not evoked by 條 all at once. For in-
stance, when combined with ‘shorts’ (一條短褲
yī tiáo duǎnkix), only the length of the shorts is
highlighted, not their flexibility or viscosity. The
selected information retrieved by 條 appears even
clearer when compared to 個 ge, most probably the
most generic Chinese classifier, usable to classify
people and objects in general.
This process of selective information retrieval
shows that classifiers act upon the noun they carry
with a sort of “selective inference” (Hobbs, 1983a;
Hobbs, 1983b). Hobbs associates this to the think-
ing process and in particular to metaphors, claim-
ing that the meaning of metaphors is only fully
understandable if retrieved within their context of
use.
A disclaimer needs to be made on the selected
examples. The Chinese language is an upper con-
cept itself, and stands for a conundrum of different
languages and dialects which constitute the World
Chineses. It derives that what sounds as a natu-
ral linguistic combination for some might sound
exotic for others. The classifiers presented in this
study have been extracted from a long list of aca-
demic articles and books on the matter, hereby
only partially cited (selected reference). The shape
classifies that have been selected represent the
ones that are mostly cited in examples and that
have been consensually defined as shape ones by
the majority of the consulted authors. There still
remains some disagreement among mother tongue
speakers. For instance, according to some of them,
the Chinese classifier 枝 zhī, presented by some
authors as shape classifier for non-living objects
and therefore also reported in fig. 1, is used in
commonsense language in rare or specific cases.
Other colleagues have claimed that the use of 顆
kē as classifier for ‘melon’ sounds unnatural, since
the shape classifier seems to match with round yet
small objects (e. g. 一顆蘋果 yī kē píngguǒ one
apple).
Eventually, given the short nature of this paper,
implications about the distinction between classi-
fiers, measure words and quantifiers5, or shape-
based and shape-related classifiers6 could not be

Current wordnets do not encode shape informa-
tion, and lack a comprehensive mapping of classi-
fiers.
This svelte research aims to show how much
lexico-semantic knowledge can be retrieved from
these small units of language and their possible
metaphorical implications. Its inclusion in word-
nets (also married with an ontological analysis, as
fig. 1 tries to show) can be beneficiary for both lan-
guage users and language learners.
The project can be framed within a bigger ef-
fort to collect comprehensive information on clas-
sifiers (not just shape ones), provided general con-
sensus on their use and meanings. For instance,
Hantology (Chou and Huang, 2010)7 could be fur-
ther tailored by inserting classifiers. Because the
database currently mainly focuses on radicals and
characters, classifiers (e. g. 團), are mapped as
characters. Since characters are then linked to all
the words they respectively generate, it results that
one character is often mapped to several upper
concepts. The author is aware that the metaphor-
ical extensions of meaning hereby presented are
subject to personal interpretation, but this should
be nevertheless valued as a primary attempt to try
to justify the collocational structure that exists be-
tween Chinese classifiers and nouns. Also, given
the apparent discrepancy between the use of classi-
fiers in commonsense language and in written lan-
guage, as mentioned above, it might also be in-
teresting to draw a comparison between real-word
and formal use of classifiers in Chinese (starting
by 普通話 pǔtōnghuà or Mandarin).
Another already initiated extension of the study
can include the cross-linguistic comparison of
classifiers, in the search for common patterns,
starting by ground literature such as (Matsumoto,
1993; Matsumoto, 1986; Paik and Bond, 2002).

The suggestion is to map them not just as information coercers, but also as lexical items (nouns, verbs, adjectives). The paper also explores the metaphorical implications that can be derived from classifiers in this double function. 1 Introduction Classifiers belong to some of the most complex issues in the grammars of the languages that own them (e. g. Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai). The approach to classifiers as not just grammatical, but also lexical items, has already been paved. (Mok, Huini and Bond, 2012; Paik and Bond, 2002) and (Bond and Paik, 2000) have for instance conducted research on classifiers and Wordnet® (WN), mainly focusing on the generation / prediction of classifiers from WN or from a common ontology. In this paper, some Chinese shape classifiers are taken into account. Upon the claim made in literature that they enhance shape-related properties entailed in the nouns they collocate with (as described in Section 2), three major claims are made. (I) Classifiers (as for this study, shape ones) can trigger shape-related information from the noun they accompany, but (II) they can also pass the shape-related information they alrea</context>

This svelte research aims to show how much lexico-semantic knowledge can be retrieved from these small units of language and their possible metaphorical implications. Its inclusion in wordnets (also married with an ontological analysis, as fig. 1 tries to show) can be beneficiary for both language users and language learners. The project can be framed within a bigger effort to collect comprehensive information on classifiers (not just shape ones), provided general consensus on their use and meanings. For instance, Hantology (Chou and Huang, 2010)7 could be further tailored by inserting classifiers. Because the database currently mainly focuses on radicals and characters, classifiers (e. g. 團), are mapped as characters. Since characters are then linked to all the words they respectively generate, it results that one character is often mapped to several upper concepts. The author is aware that the metaphorical extensions of meaning hereby presented are subject to personal interpretation, but this should be nevertheless valued as a primary attempt to try to justify the collocational structure that exists between Chinese classifiers and n</context>

All the points in the research stress the need to consider classifiers and shape-related information in wordnets in greater detail. The research also tries to justify the use of classifiers in commonsense language. The choice of selecting shape over other kinds of classifiers, as well as the hypothesis of a metaphorical justification in their use in language are inscribed in the bigger frame of current research (Quattri, 2013a; Quattri, 2013b). 2 Shape classifiers as lexico-semantic information carriers According to (Huang and Ahrens, 2003), classifiers coerce information from the noun they accompany. This kind of retrieved information helps to better specify the noun into kind, event or individual. The authors, together with (Imai, Saalbach and Stern, 2010), categorize classifiers according to the properties that they extract from the noun they collocate with, including ShapeAttributes, such as length, or roundness, or flatness.1 Although not explicitly stated, it seems that other authors apply the similar value to classifiers, i. e. of being elements that coerce or extract information from the event or object that comes after </context>

Another already initiated extension of the study can include the cross-linguistic comparison of classifiers, in the search for common patterns, starting by ground literature such as (Matsumoto, 1993; Matsumoto, 1986; Paik and Bond, 2002).

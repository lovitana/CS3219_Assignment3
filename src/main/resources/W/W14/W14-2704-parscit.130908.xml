Online social communities are becoming
increasingly popular platforms for people
to share information, seek emotional sup-
port, and maintain accountability for los-
ing weight. Studying the language and
discourse in these communities can offer
insights on how users benefit from using
these applications. This paper presents a
preliminary analysis of language and dis-
course patterns in forum posts by users
who lose weight and keep it off versus
users with fluctuating weight dynamics.
Our results reveal differences about how
the types of posts, polarity of sentiments,
and semantic cohesion of posts made by
users vary along with their weight loss pat-
tern. To our knowledge, this is the first
discourse-level analysis of language and
weight loss dynamics.

1 Introduction and Related Work

<bodyText confidence="0.999888338983051">
Obesity is a major public health problem; the
number of people suffering from obesity has
risen globally in the last decade (Das and Fax-
vaag, 2014). Many of these people are trying to
lose weight as the multifactorial diseases such as
metabolic syndromes, respiratory problems, coro-
nary heart disease, and psychological challenges
are all closely associated with obesity (Rippe et
al., 1998; Must et al., 1999). More obese peo-
ple are trying to lose weight by using weight-
loss applications and other people interested in
using these applications are trying to avoid gain-
ing weight. Many internet services are becoming
increasingly popular for supporting weight loss
as they provide users with the opportunities to
seek information by asking questions, answering
questions, sharing their experiences and provid-
ing emotional support. Also, the internet provides
many attributes that can help people feel more
comfortable with openly expressing their prob-
lems and concerns (Ballantine and Stephenson,
2011; Hwang et al., 2010).
Most of the existing studies (Saperstein et al.,
2007; Johnson and Wardle, 2011; Hwang et al.,
2010; Ballantine and Stephenson, 2011; Leahey et
al., 2012; Das and Faxvaag, 2014) focused on why
people participate in online weight loss discus-
sion forums and how the social support can help
them to lose weight. These studies are conducted
from the perspective of medical and psychology
domains, where the data are collected via inter-
views or a small set of online forum data that are
manually analyzed by human experts. Their pri-
mary focus is on measuring the social support by
collecting views/opinions of people through sur-
veys; less attention is given to understanding the
natural language aspects of users’ posts on these
online communities. Unlike choosing a small sub-
set of a dataset, our work is novel in automat-
ing the process of language analysis that can han-
dle a larger dataset. Automating the process can
also help classify the user type based on the lan-
guage efficiently. This work also considers weekly
check-in weights of users along with the study of
their language.
In this paper, we study the user’s language in
correlation with their weight loss dynamics. To
this end, we analyze a corpus of forum posts gen-
erated by users on the forum of a popular weight
loss application. The forum from which we ob-
tained the data is divided into several threads
where each thread consists of several posts made
by different users. From the overall dataset we
identify two preliminary patterns of weight dy-
namics: (1) users who lose weight and success-
fully maintain the weight loss (i.e., from one week
to the next, weight is lost or weight remains the
same) and (2) users whose weight pattern fluc-
tuates (i.e., from one week to the next, weight

changes are erratic or inconsistent). While there
are many possible groupings that we could have
utilized, we chose this grouping because of the
known problems with “yo-yo” dieting compared
to a more steady weight-loss. We study how the
user’s language in these two groups varies by mea-
suring the semantic cohesion and sentiment of
posts made by them.
Our main contributions include understanding
the types of posts users make on different threads
with a main focus on question-related posts, the
type of language they use by measuring the se-
mantic cohesion and sentiment by correlating with
users’ weight loss patterns. From the empirical
analysis we find that users who lose weight in
a fluctuating manner are very active on the dis-
cussion forums compared to the users who fol-
low a non-increasing weight loss pattern. We also
find that users of non-increasing weight loss pat-
tern mostly reply to the posts made by other users
and fluctuating users post more questions compar-
atively. Both the users from these two clusters dif-
fer in terms of the way their posts cohere with pre-
vious posts in the threads and also in terms of the
sentiment associated with their posts.

2 Dataset
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958166666667">
We obtain a text corpus of online discussion fo-
rums from Lose It!, a popular mobile and web-
based weight loss application. Along with the text
corpus, we also obtain weekly weight check-in
data for a subset of users. The entire corpus con-
sists of eight different forums that are subdivided
into conversation topic threads. Each thread con-
sists of several posts made by different users. The
forum data in our corpus consists of 884 threads,
with a median length of 20 posts per thread. The
posts were made between January 1, 2010 and July
1, 2012. We identify the subset of users for whom
we have weight check-in data and who made at
least 25 weight check-ins during this time period.
This results in a total of 2,270 users.
The interesting feature of this weight loss appli-
cation is that users are encouraged to set goals to
regularly log their weight, diet, and exercise. For
a subset of users, Lose It! has provided a weekly
weight “check-in”, an average of the user’s weight
check-ins during the week, for the January 1, 2010
through July 1, 2012 period. This allows us to jux-
tapose the weekly weights of the users with their
posts on the discussion forums.

We partition the users into two groups based
on their dynamic weight loss patterns: a non-
increasing group and a fluctuating group.

1. Non-increasing: For each week j, the user’s

2. Fluctuating: If the difference between two

follow the non-increasing constraint, users
are grouped into this category.
We empirically set A = 0.04 to divide the
users in our dataset into two groups of similar size.
To illustrate the two patterns of weight change,
Figure 1 shows the weekly weight check-ins of
two individual users, one from each group. This
grouping is coarse, but is motivated by studies
(Kraschnewski et al., 2010; Wing and Phelan,
2005) acknowledging that approximately 80% of
people who set out to lose weight are successful
at long-term weight loss maintenance, where suc-
cessful maintenance is defined as losing 10% or
more of the body weight and maintaining that for
at least an year. In the future for further analysis,
we aim to separate users less coarsely, e.g., users
who maintain their weight neither gaining nor los-
ing weight, users who lose weight and maintain it
and finally, users who gain weight.

3 Empirical Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99937725">
In this section, we present preliminary observa-
tions on how the language and discourse patterns
of forum posts vary with respect to weight loss dy-
namics. As an initial step, part-of-speech (POS)
tagging is performed on all forum posts using the
Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).
From the weekly check-in data we identified the
number of users and the number of posts from
each weight-loss pattern cluster which are shown
in Table 1. We see that the average number of
posts by fluctuating users is greater than the av-
erage number of posts by non-increasing users.

3.1 Asking Questions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999859333333333">
Previous studies (Bambina, 2007; Langford et al.,
1997) revealed that people on online health com-
munities mainly engage in two activities: (i) seek-
ing information, and (ii) getting emotional sup-
port. People usually ask questions to other com-
munity members or just browse through the com-
munity forums to get information while seeking
information. Below is an example (paraphrased)
showing how a users ask and respond to questions.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.481863">
Example thread: “New user”
</figure>
<figureCaption confidence="0.958192">
User 1: “Did anyone upgrade to the pre-
mium app? What do you like about it?”
User 2: “I upgraded to the premium.
I LOVE the functionality to log food in
advance. I can track and set goals that
are not related to weight like how much
I sleep, how much water I drink, etc.”
User 3: “I upgraded my account to pre-
mium too. I really liked the added fea-
tures because it helped me keep track of
my steps and participate in challenges.”
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982015">
We are interested in knowing whether users in
the two clusters are actively involved in posting
questions. We deem a forum post to be a question
if it meets one of these two conditions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999691">
1. Wh-question words: If a sentence in the post
starts with a question word: Wh-Determiner
(WDT), Wh-pronoun (WP), Possessive wh-
pronoun (WP$), Wh-adverb (WRB).
2. Punctuation: If the post contains a question
mark symbol (‘?’).

Positive, Neutral and Negative sentiments are: 22%, 46.5%

20.9%, 37.6% and 41.5% respectively.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999986">
We computed the ratio of question-oriented
posts made by each user in the two clusters. Af-
ter averaging these ratio values across all the users
in each cluster separately, we found that on aver-
age, 32.6% of the posts made by non-increasing
users were questions (5E = 0.061). And, 37.7%
of the posts made by fluctuating users were ques-
tions (5E = 0.042). This shows that on an aver-
age fluctuating users post relatively more number
of questions than the non-increasing users.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999983">
3.2 Sentiment of Posts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999767142857143">
Analyzing the sentiment of user posts in the fo-
rums can provide a suprisingly meaningful sense
of how the loss of weight impacts the sentiment of
user’s post. In this analysis, we report our initial
results on extracting the sentiments of user’s posts.
In order to achieve this, we utilized the Stanford
Sentiment Analyzer (Socher et al., 2013). This an-
alyzer classifies a text input into one of five senti-
ment categories—from Very Positive to Very Nega-
tive. We merge the five classes into three: Positive,
Neutral and Negative. In future, we may consider
specific (health and nutrition) sentiment lexicons.
We analyzed the sentiment of posts contributed
by the users from the two clusters. As shown
in Figure 2, posts of users belonging to the non-
increasing cluster are more neutral whereas the
posts made by users from the fluctuating clus-
ter are mainly of negative sentiment. This gives
an interesting intuition that the fluctuating group
of users might require more emotional support as
they use more negative sentiment in their posts.

3.3 Cohesion with Previous Posts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993394736842">
Cohesion is the property of a well-written docu-
ment that links together sentences in the same con-
text. Several existing models measure the cohe-
sion of a given text with applications to topic seg-
mentation or multi-document summarization (El-
sner and Charniak, 2011; Barzilay and Lapata,
2005; Soricut and Marcu, 2006). In this analy-
sis, we want to find out if there is any correlation
between the cohesiveness of posts made by users
and their pattern of weight loss. We are mainly in-
terested in measuring the similarity of a user’s post
with respect to the previous posts in a thread. This
can help identify users who elaborate on previous
post versus those who shift the topic.
We focus on content words: verbs and
nouns (part-of-speech tags VB, VBZ, VBP, VBD,
VBN, VBG, NN, NNP, NNPS). Next, we use
WordNet (Miller, 1995) to identify synonyms of
the content words. Then, we compute similar-
ity between the current post and previous posts of
other users in the thread, in terms of commonly
shared verbs and nouns including synonyms. In
our current, preliminary analysis, we consider this
similarity score to be the measure of cohesion.
In this step, we consider all posts that are not
thread-initial. To approximate whether a post is
cohesive, we compare the nouns and verbs of the
current post to the list of nouns and verbs (plus
synonyms) obtained from the previous posts of the
thread. Our analysis finds that posts made by fluc-
tuating users have an average cohesion score of
0.42 (5E = 0.008), whereas posts made by non-
increasing users have an average cohesion score
of 0.51 (5E = 0.027). This suggests that non-
increasing users may be more focused when par-
ticipating in forums whereas the fluctuating users
are more prone to make posts that have less in
common with the previous posts in a thread.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999399">
In this paper, we analyze how the language
changes based on the weight loss dynamics of
users who participate in the forum of a popular
weight-loss application. Specifically, this analy-
sis revealed four interesting insights about the two
types of users who lose weight in a non-increasing
manner and who lose weight in a fluctuating man-
ner. Firstly, fluctuating users are more active in
participation compared to the other set of users.
Secondly, fluctuating users post more question-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999930592592592">
oriented posts compared to the non-increasing
users. Thirdly, non-increasing users contribute
posts that are more cohesive with respect to the
previous posts in a given thread. Fourthly, posts
contributed by fluctuating users have more neg-
ative sentiment compared to the posts made by
non-increasing users. This observation hints that
fluctuating users may need more emotional sup-
port to continue using this weight loss application
and lose weight in an effective manner.
While this work is preliminary, our analyses
provide a valuable early “proof of concept” for
providing insights on how user behavior within
online weight loss forums might impact weight
outcomes. These sorts of analyses, particularly
when replicated, could provide valuable insights
for developing refined online weight loss forums
that might facilitate more effective interactions for
weight loss. It could also provide valuable insights
for improving behavioral theories about behavior
change (Hekler et al., 2013).
In the future, we plan to focus on a larger cor-
pus from an extended time period, aligned more
closely with weekly check-in weight data. Other
directions for consideration are the temporal as-
pect of forum posts and gender-based analyses of
user behavior.

People usually ask questions to other community members or just browse through the community forums to get information while seeking information.

Our results reveal differences about how the types of posts, polarity of sentiments, and semantic cohesion of posts made by users vary along with their weight loss pattern. To our knowledge, this is the first discourse-level analysis of language and weight loss dynamics. 1 Introduction and Related Work Obesity is a major public health problem; the number of people suffering from obesity has risen globally in the last decade (Das and Faxvaag, 2014). Many of these people are trying to lose weight as the multifactorial diseases such as metabolic syndromes, respiratory problems, coronary heart disease, and psychological challenges are all closely associated with obesity (Rippe et al., 1998; Must et al., 1999). More obese people are trying to lose weight by using weightloss applications and other people interested in using these applications are trying to avoid gaining weight.

While this work is preliminary, our analyses provide a valuable early “proof of concept” for providing insights on how user behavior within online weight loss forums might impact weight outcomes. These sorts of analyses, particularly when replicated, could provide valuable insights for developing refined online weight loss forums that might facilitate more effective interactions for weight loss. It could also provide valuable insights for improving behavioral theories about behavior change (Hekler et al., 2013). In the future, we plan to focus on a larger corpus from an extended time period, aligned more closely with weekly check-in weight data. Other directions for consideration are the temporal aspect of forum posts and gender-based analyses of user behavior.

That is, wj ≤ (1 + A)wj−1. 2. Fluctuating: If the difference between two consecutive weekly check-in weights do not follow the non-increasing constraint, users are grouped into this category. We empirically set A = 0.04 to divide the users in our dataset into two groups of similar size. To illustrate the two patterns of weight change, Figure 1 shows the weekly weight check-ins of two individual users, one from each group. This grouping is coarse, but is motivated by studies (Kraschnewski et al., 2010; Wing and Phelan, 2005) acknowledging that approximately 80% of people who set out to lose weight are successful at long-term weight loss maintenance, where successful maintenance is defined as losing 10% or more of the body weight and maintaining that for at least an year. In the future for further analysis, we aim to separate users less coarsely, e.g., users who maintain their weight neither gaining nor losing weight, users who lose weight and maintain it and finally, users who gain weight. 2.1 Characteristics of Online Community The Lose It! application helps users set a personalized daily</context>

And, 37.7% of the posts made by fluctuating users were questions (5E = 0.042). This shows that on an average fluctuating users post relatively more number of questions than the non-increasing users. 3.2 Sentiment of Posts Analyzing the sentiment of user posts in the forums can provide a suprisingly meaningful sense of how the loss of weight impacts the sentiment of user’s post. In this analysis, we report our initial results on extracting the sentiments of user’s posts. In order to achieve this, we utilized the Stanford Sentiment Analyzer (Socher et al., 2013). This analyzer classifies a text input into one of five sentiment categories—from Very Positive to Very Negative. We merge the five classes into three: Positive, Neutral and Negative. In future, we may consider specific (health and nutrition) sentiment lexicons. We analyzed the sentiment of posts contributed by the users from the two clusters. As shown in Figure 2, posts of users belonging to the nonincreasing cluster are more neutral whereas the posts made by users from the fluctuating cluster are mainly of negative sentiment. This gives an interesting intuition that the fluctuating group of</context>

This gives an interesting intuition that the fluctuating group of users might require more emotional support as they use more negative sentiment in their posts. 3.3 Cohesion with Previous Posts Cohesion is the property of a well-written document that links together sentences in the same context. Several existing models measure the cohesion of a given text with applications to topic segmentation or multi-document summarization (Elsner and Charniak, 2011; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005; Soricut and Marcu, 2006). In this analysis, we want to find out if there is any correlation between the cohesiveness of posts made by users and their pattern of weight loss. We are mainly interested in measuring the similarity of a user’s post with respect to the previous posts in a thread. This can help identify users who elaborate on previous post versus those who shift the topic. We focus on content words: verbs and nouns (part-of-speech tags VB, VBZ, VBP, VBD, VBN, VBG, NN, NNP, NNPS). Next, we use WordNet (Miller, 1995) to identify synonyms of the content words. Then, we compute similarity between the current po</context>

As an initial step, part-of-speech (POS) tagging is performed on all forum posts using the Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). From the weekly check-in data we identified the number of users and the number of posts from each weight-loss pattern cluster which are shown in Table 1. We see that the average number of posts by fluctuating users is greater than the average number of posts by non-increasing users.

That is, wj ≤ (1 + A)wj−1. 2. Fluctuating: If the difference between two consecutive weekly check-in weights do not follow the non-increasing constraint, users are grouped into this category. We empirically set A = 0.04 to divide the users in our dataset into two groups of similar size. To illustrate the two patterns of weight change, Figure 1 shows the weekly weight check-ins of two individual users, one from each group. This grouping is coarse, but is motivated by studies (Kraschnewski et al., 2010; Wing and Phelan, 2005) acknowledging that approximately 80% of people who set out to lose weight are successful at long-term weight loss maintenance, where successful maintenance is defined as losing 10% or more of the body weight and maintaining that for at least an year. In the future for further analysis, we aim to separate users less coarsely, e.g., users who maintain their weight neither gaining nor losing weight, users who lose weight and maintain it and finally, users who gain weight. 2.1 Characteristics of Online Community The Lose It! application helps users set a personalized daily calorie budget, track t</context>

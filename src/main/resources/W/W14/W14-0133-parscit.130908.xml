Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998075">
The synsets in Assamese Wordnet play a sig-
nificant role in the enrichment of Assamese
language. These synsets are built depending
on the intuition the native speakers of the lan-
guage. There is no fixed rule in the arranging
the positions of each synset. The present paper
mainly aims to make a quantitative compari-
son of every synset position of Wordnet seeing
the occurrences of these synsets in corpus of
Assamese (approximately 1.5 million words).
The experimental result of this comparison is
represented with the help of diagrams. Again,
it is an attempt to highlight the timeline of
each synsets of Wordnet based on the corpus.
It is dealt with the change of the synonymous
word forms in course of times.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978816282051282">
Language is a central feature of human identity.
Language is the identity of that particular com-
munity. No community can survive without a
language. The language of the communities live
in India is very ancient and rich. Similarly, As-
samese language is also one of the ancient and
rich languages of the north-eastern languages.
Assamese has been regarded as a rich language
with its own script and written literary texts since
the ancient times. Assamese language belongs to
the Satam group of the Indo-European language
family. The main root of this language lies to the
Indo-Aryan languages.
Dr. Banikanta Kakati has classified the devel-
opment of Assamese language into three stages
(Kakati, 2008):
A. Early Assamese (14th to 16th century
A.D.)
This period again may be divided into a) Pre-
Vaishnavite and b) Vaishnavite sub-periods. The
earliest known Assamese writer is Hema
Saraswati, who wrote a small poem ‘Prahlad
Charit’. Sankardeva, the great Vaishnavite re-
former in Assam, born in 1449 A.D. composed
religious songs and drama. In his popularly
known as Braja-Bali idioms (Goswami, 1983).
B. Middle Assamese (17th to 19th centu-
ry A.D.)
The main characteristic of this period is the his-
torical writings initiated under the inspiration of
the Ahom court. These historical writings in
prose are known as Buranjis. In the Ahom court,
historical Chronicles were at first composed in
their original Tibeto-Chinese languages, but
when the Ahom rulers adopted Assamese as the
court language, historical chronicles began to be
written in Assamese. The language is essentially
modern except for slight alterations in grammar
and spelling.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.672802">
C. Modern Assamese
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972181818182">
The modern Assamese period begins with the
publication of the Bible in Assamese by Ameri-
can Baptist Missionaries in the first quarter of the
19th century. The currently prevalent standard
Asamiya has its roots in the Sibasagar dialect of
Eastern Assam. The American Baptist Mission-
aries were the first to use this dialect in translat-
ing the Bible in 1813 A.D. In 1836 A.D., they
started a monthly periodical called Arunodoy and
in 1848 A.D., Nathan Brown published the first
book on Assamese grammar. The Missionaries
published the first Assamese-English Dictionary
compiled by Miles Bronson in 1867 A.D. The
Sibasagar Asamiya dialect came to be formally
recognized as the Standard Asamiya dialect
when it was made the official language of the
state by the schools, courts, and Govt. officers in
1872. This Standard language is accepted by all
other Asamiya dialect as the standard norm and
was used for all formal occasions – in writing, in
the classroom, in meetings, in the courts and of-
fices and for inter-dialect communication also.

2 Assamese Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996175166666667">
The term ‘corpus’ is used to refer to a collection
of linguistic data (covering spoken and written)
in a language for some specific purposes and the-
se data are to stored, managed and analyzed in
digital format. There is a huge amount of corpus
in Assamese language consisting of approxi-
mately 15 or 20 lakh words based on the various
Assamese literary or non-literary texts (such as
magazines, newspaper, dramas, novels, stories,
articles etc.). Words are collected from various
texts ranging from 19th to 21st centuries (Sarma et
al., 2012).
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.992089" genericHeader="method">
3 Assamese Wordnet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998479888888889">
Wordnet is a repository of words of a language.
Wordnet is basically a synonymous lexical data-
base. Vocabulary plays a main role in building
Wordnet. Assamese language possesses a huge
amount of vocabulary; it becomes easy to build
Wordnet in the language. The task of Assamese
Wordnet building is almost ready to provide us
with all the lexical words. Yet there are still
many words in the language those need to be
entered (Sarma et al., 2010).
Assamese Wordnet is built on the basis of
Hindi Wordnet (Sarma et al., 2012). Here, words
are shown according to the sense of the given
context or sentence and accordingly, we can de-
rive different meanings from them. For example,
the Assamese word ‘paani, and ‘farkaal’’ has
different meaning according to its sense in the
context.

4 Quantitative Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996554">
The main aim of quantitative analysis is a com-
plete description. Quantitative analysis allows for
fine distinctions to be drawn because it is not
necessary to the data into a finite number of clas-
sifications.
The resulting corpus contains over 1.5 billion
words and 14958 Assamese Wordnet synset data.
Initially, we have tried to find out the position of
corpus and synset data. The synset category is
classified as noun, verb, adjective and adverb for
Assamese Wordnet. Here, we compare the fre-
quency of Wordnet synset to the frequencies of
Corpus data.
Some results of words position analysis in As-
samese Wordnet with Corpus are mentioned be-
low:

In Figure 1, we have shown Synset Positions
of Noun in Assamese Corpus. For the First posi-
tion we have found 40.89%, for the second and
third 33.61% and 24.55% respectively and so on.
Similarly in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 we have
shown Synset Positions and analysis of verb,
adverb and adjective in Assamese Corpus.
Finally in Figure 5, it is clear that the finding
of first position is always higher than the remain-
ing synset position.

5 Timeline of Words
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993543666666667">
Wordnet has been built taking various words of
hundred years. There are 38 synset positions in
Wordnet. Especially, words are found to be most
frequently used in the synset positions like 1st,
2nd and 3rd which cover a period from 1900 to
1995. It is worth mentioning here that we have
not found any synonymous words after the
synset position 17. Most of the words starting
from synset position no. 1 to 5 we have seen
words have became change from the old As-
samese to modern forms. Thus, it has enriched
the words in Assamese language.
While studying the synset in Assamese lan-
guage, it is seen that most of the words used by
the Christian missionaries have not been used at
present times. It does not mean that these words
have disappeared completely, but these are used
less frequently with change in the forms of those
words.
Examples of words change in Assamese lan-
guage are mentioned below:

Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892">
The present paper makes an examination on the
timeline of synset positions of Assamese
Wordnet. In order to perform this task, mainly
we refer to Assamese corpus covering time peri-
od from 1900 to 2008. In this corpus, there are
more than 1.5 million texts. We consider all the
synsets of Assamese Wordnet entered till date as
it is in a developing stage. First we determine the
timeline of all the corpus entries and secondly we
map up these entries with their corresponding
synset entries. While mapping we also consider
the respective positions of each synset entries.
After analysis the data, we basically found that
from first to fifth position of synset entries are
occurred frequently in the time period of our giv-
en corpus. But the results varied from different
word categories those are clearly depicted in the
above sections.

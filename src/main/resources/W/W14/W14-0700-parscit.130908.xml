Causality is a research field with roots in philosophy, psychology, physics and application domains in
medicine and knowledge engineering. It focuses on cause-effect, or causal, relations between two events
or actions, in which one (the cause), causes the other (the effect). This information can be used in a
number of natural language processing applications such as question answering, text summarization,
decision support etc. While encyclopaedic knowledge can be manually encoded into causal relations, in
many other domains, causality is not explicit and must be inferred from data. The EACL Workshop on
Computational Approaches to Causality in Language provides a forum for presentation and discussion
of innovative research on all aspects of recognition, representation and the use of causal information and
its processing in NLP-centered applications.
These proceedings contain papers presented at the workshop held in Gothenburg, Sweden on April
26 2014, in conjunction with the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for
Computational Linguistics. We received 12 papers which were reviewed by the members of the workshop
program committee, and accepted 7 of them.
I would like to thank all submitting authors for their work. I also would like to thank the members of the
program committee for an outstanding job in reviewing and providing advice to the authors and to the
organization committee, and the MUSE project (EU FP7-296703) for sponsoring this workshop.

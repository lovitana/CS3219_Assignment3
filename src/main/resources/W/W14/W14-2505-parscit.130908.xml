Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999826071428571">
We describe a research activity carried
out during January–April 2014, seeking to
increase engagement between the natural
language processing research community
and social science scholars. In this activ-
ity, participants were offered a corpus of
text relevant to the 2007–8 financial cri-
sis and an open-ended prompt. Their re-
sponses took the form of a short paper
and an optional demonstration, to which a
panel of judges will respond with the goal
of identifying efforts with the greatest po-
tential for future interdisciplinary collabo-
ration.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995025">
In recent years, numerous interdisciplinary re-
search meetings have sought to bring together
computer scientists with expertise in automated
text data analysis and scholars with substan-
tive interests that might make use of text data.
The latter group has included political scientists,
economists, and communications scholars. An
NSF Research Coordination Network grant to en-
courage research using open government data was
awarded to co-authors Washington and Wilker-
son in 2013. The network for Political Informat-
ics, or PoliInformatics, brought together a steering
committee from diverse research backgrounds that
convened in February 2013. At that meeting, a
substantive focus on the 2007–8 nancial crisis was
selected.
Drawing inspiration from the “shared task”
model that has been successful in the natural lan-
guage processing community, we designed a re-
search competition for computer scientists. In a
shared task, a gold-standard dataset is created in
advance of the competition, inputs and outputs are
defined by the organizers, typically creating a su-
pervised learning setup with held-out data used for
evaluation. Constraints on the resources that may
be used are typically set in place as well, to fo-
cus the energies of participants on a core prob-
lem, and the official evaluation scores are pub-
lished, usually as open-source software. Final sys-
tems (or system output) is submitted by a dead-
line and judged automatically against the gold-
standard. Participants report on their systems in
short papers, typically presented at a meeting as-
sociated with a conference or workshop.
With neither a clear definition of what the fi-
nal outcome might be, nor the resources to create
the necessary gold-standard data, we developed a
more open-ended competition. A text corpus was
collected and made available, and a prompt was
offered. Participants were given freedom in how
to respond; competition entries took the form of
short research papers and optional demonstrations
of the results of the projects. Rather than an ob-
jective score, a panel of judges organized by the
PoliInformatics steering committee offered public
reviews of the work, with an emphasis on poten-
tial for future interdisciplinary research efforts that
might stem from these preliminary projects.

The prompts offered to participants were:
Who was the financial crisis? We seek to un-
derstand the participants in the lawmaking and
regulatory processes that formed the government’s
response to the crisis: the individuals, indus-
tries, and professionals targeted by those poli-
cies; the agencies and organizations responsi-
ble for implementing them; and the lobbyists,
witnesses, advocates, and politicians who were
actively involved—and the connections among
them.

Forty teams initially registered to participate in the
unshared task; ten submitted papers. The teams
came from a variety of institutions spread across
six countries. Half of the teams included links to
online demonstrations or browsable system out-
put. At this writing, the papers are under review
by the panel of judges. We provide a very brief
summary of the contributions of each team.

Bordea et al. (2014) inferred importance and hi-
erarchy of topics along with expertise mining to
find which participants in the discourse might be
experts (e.g., Paul Volcker and “proprietary trad-
ing”) based on FOMC, FCIC, and Congressional
hearing and report data.
Baerg et al. (2014) considered transcripts of the
FOMC, developing a method for scaling the pref-
erences of its members with respect to inflation
(hawks to doves); the method incorporates auto-
matic dimensionality reduction and expert topic
interpretation.
Zirn et al. (2014) also focused on the transcripts,
distinguishing between position-taking statements
and shorter “discussion elements” that express
agreement or disagreement rather than substance,
and used this analysis to quantify similarity among
FOMC members and take first steps toward extrac-
tion of sub-dialogues among them.
Bourreau and Poibeau (2014) focused on the
FCIC report and the two Congressional reports,
identifying named entities and then visualizing
correlations among mentions both statically (as
networks) and dynamically. Clark et al. (2014)
considered Congressional hearings, applying a
reasoning model that integrates analysis of social
roles and relationships with analysis of individ-
ual beliefs in hope of detecting opinion shifts and
signs of influence.

Miller and McCoy (2014) considered FOMC tran-
scripts, applying topic models for dimensionality
reduction and viewing topic proportions as time
series.
In a study of the TARP, Dodd-Frank, and the
health reform bills, Li et al. (2014) explored the
ideas expressed in those bills, applying models of
text reuse from bills introduced in the 110th and
111th Congresses.
Wang et al. (2014) implemented a query-
focused summarization system for FOMC and
FCIC meeting transcripts and Congressional hear-
ings, incorporating topic and expertise measures
into the score, and queried the corpus with candi-
date causes for the crisis, derived from Wikipedia
(e.g., “subprime lending” and “growth housing
bubble”).
Kleinnijenhuis et al. (2014) considered Con-
gressional hearings alongside news text from the
United States and the United Kingdom, carrying
out keyword analysis to compare and measure di-
rectional effects between the two, on different di-
mensions.

The unshared task was successful in attracting the
interest of forty participants working on ten teams.
A highly diverse range of activities ensued, each
of which is being reviewed at this writing by a
panel of judges. Reviews and final outcomes will

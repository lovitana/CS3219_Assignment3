Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999305">
We propose a system for the interpreta-
tion of anaphoric relationships between
unbound pronouns and quantifiers. The
main technical contribution of our pro-
posal consists in combining generalized
quantifiers with dependent types. Empir-
ically, our system allows a uniform treat-
ment of all types of unbound anaphora, in-
cluding the notoriously difficult cases such
as quantificational subordination, cumula-
tive and branching continuations, and don-
key anaphora.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934857142857">
The phenomenon of unbound anaphora refers to
instances where anaphoric pronouns occur outside
the syntactic scopes (i.e. the c-command domain)
of their quantifier antecedents. The main kinds of
unbound anaphora are regular anaphora to quan-
tifiers, quantificational subordination, and donkey
anaphora, as exemplified by (1) to (3) respectively:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999874666666667">
(1) Most kids entered. They looked happy.
(2) Every man loves a woman. They kiss them.
(3) Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989091875">
Unbound anaphoric pronouns have been dealt
with in two main semantic paradigms: dynamic
semantic theories (Groenendijk and Stokhof,
1991); (Van den Berg, 1996); (Nouwen, 2003) and
the E-type/D-type tradition (Evans, 1977); (Heim,
1990); (Elbourne, 2005). In the dynamic seman-
tic theories pronouns are taken to be (syntactically
free, but semantically bound) variables, and con-
text serves as a medium supplying values for the
variables. In the E-type/D-type tradition pronouns
are treated as quantifiers. Our system combines
aspects of both families of theories. As in the E-
type/D-type tradition we treat unbound anaphoric
pronouns as quantifiers; as in the systems of dy-
namic semantics context is used as a medium sup-
plying (possibly dependent) types as their poten-
tial quantificational domains. Like Dekker’s Pred-
icate Logic with Anaphora and more recent mul-
tidimensional models (Dekker, 1994); (Dekker,
2008), our system lends itself to the compositional
treatment of unbound anaphora, while keeping a
classical, static notion of truth. The main novelty
of our proposal consists in combining generalized
quantifiers (Mostowski, 1957); (Lindstr¨om, 1966);
(Barwise and Cooper, 1981) with dependent types
(Martin-L¨of, 1972); (Ranta, 1994).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
we introduce informally the main features of our
system. Section 3 sketches the process of English-
to-formal language translation. Finally, sections 4
and 5 define the syntax and semantics of the sys-
tem.

2.1 Context, types and dependent types
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999365916666667">
The variables of our system are always typed. We
write x : X to denote that the variable x is of type
X and refer to this as a type specification of the
variable x. Types, in this paper, are interpreted as
sets. We write the interpretation of the type X as
IIXII.
Types can depend on variables of other types.
Thus, if we already have a type specification x :
X, then we can also have type Y (x) depending
on the variable x and we can declare a variable y
of type Y by stating y : Y (x). The fact that Y
depends on X is modeled as a projection

7r : IIYII → IIXII.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999746333333333">
So that if the variable x of type X is interpreted as
an element a E IIXII, IIY II(a) is interpreted as the
fiber of 7r over a (the preimage of {a} under 7r)

IIYII(a) = {b E IIYII : 7r(b) = a}.

<bodyText confidence="0.999969833333333">
One standard natural language example of such a
dependence of types is that if m is a variable of
the type of months M, there is a type D(m) of
the days of the month m. Such type dependencies
can be nested, i.e., we can have a sequence of type
specifications of the (individual) variables:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.92462">
x : X, y : Y (x), z : Z(x, y).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998913333333333">
Context for us is a partially ordered sequence of
type specifications of the (individual) variables
and it is interpreted as a parameter set, i.e. as a
set of compatible n-tuples of the elements of the
sets corresponding to the types involved (compat-
ible wrt all projections).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998023">
2.2 Quantifiers, chains of quantifiers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978061769230769">
Our system defines quantifiers and predicates
polymorphically. A generalized quantifier Q is
an association to every set Z a subset of the
power set of Z. If we have a predicate P de-
fined in a context I&apos;, then for any interpreta-
tion of the context kI&apos;k it is interpreted as a
subset of its parameter set. Quantifier phrases,
e.g. every man or some woman, are interpreted
as follows: keverym:mank = {kmank} and
kSomew:womank = {X ⊆ kwomank : X =6 ∅} .
The interpretation of quantifier phrases is fur-
ther extended into the interpretation of chains of
quantifiers. Consider an example in (2):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.793617">
(2) Every man loves a woman. They kiss them.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820444444445">
Multi-quantifier sentences such as the first sen-
tence in (2) are known to be ambiguous with
different readings corresponding to how various
quantifiers are semantically related in the sen-
tence. To account for the readings available for
such multi-quantifier sentences, we raise quanti-
fier phrases to the front of a sentence to form
(generalized) quantifier prefixes - chains of quan-
tifiers. Chains of quantifiers are built from quanti-
fier phrases using three chain-constructors: pack-
formation rule (?, ... , ?), sequential composi-
tion ?|?, and parallel composition ?? . The se-
mantical operations that correspond to the chain-
constructors (known as cumulation, iteration and
branching) capture in a compositional manner cu-
mulative, scope-dependent and branching read-
ings, respectively.
The idea of chain-constructors and the cor-
responding semantical operations builds on
Mostowski’s notion of quantifier (Mostowski,
1957) further generalized by Lindstr¨om to a
so-called polyadic quantifier (Lindstr¨om, 1966),
see (Bellert and Zawadowski, 1989). To use a
familiar example, a multi-quantifier prefix like
∀m:M|∃w:W is thought of as a single two-place
quantifier obtained by an operation on the two
single quantifiers, and it has as denotation:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9649535">
k∀m:M|∃w:Wk = {R ⊆ kMk × kWk:{a ∈ kMk:
{b ∈ kWk: ha, bi ∈ R} ∈ k∃w:Wk} ∈ k∀m:Mk}.
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9977625">
In this paper we generalize the three chain-
constructors and the corresponding semantical op-
erations to (pre-) chains defined on dependent
types.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994327">
2.3 Dynamic extensions of contexts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98227936">
In our system language expressions are all defined
in context. Thus the first sentence in (2) (on the
most natural interpretation where a woman de-
pends on every man) translates (via the process de-
scribed in Section 3) into a sentence with a chain
of quantifiers in a context:
I&apos; ` ∀m:M|∃w:WLove(m, w),
and says that the set of pairs, a man and a woman
he loves, has the following property: the set of
those men that love some woman each is the set
of all men. The way to understand the second sen-
tence in (2) (i.e. the anaphoric continuation) is that
every man kisses the women he loves rather than
those loved by someone else. Thus the first sen-
tence in (2) must deliver some internal relation be-
tween the types corresponding to the two quanti-
fier phrases.
In our analysis, the first sentence in (2) extends
the context I&apos; by adding new variable specifica-
tions on newly formed types for every quantifier
phrase in the chain Ch = ∀m:M|∃w:W - for the
purpose of the formation of such new types we in-
troduce a new type constructor T. That is, the first
sentence in (2) (denoted as cp) extends the context
by adding:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.895305">
tϕ,Vm : Tϕ,Vm:M; tϕ,∃w : Tϕ,∃w:W (tϕ,Vm)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998038">
The interpretations of types (that correspond to
quantifier phrases in Ch) from the extended con-
text I&apos;ϕ are defined in a two-step procedure using
the inductive clauses through which we define Ch
but in the reverse direction.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998562">
11
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.99815075">
Step 1. We define fibers of new types by inverse
induction.
Basic step.
For the whole chain Ch = ∀m:M|∃w:W we put:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.944912666666667">
kTϕ,∀m:M|∃w:W k := kLovek.
Inductive step.
kTϕ,∀m:Mk = {a ∈ kMk: {b ∈ kWk:
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9297185">
ha, bi ∈ kLovek} ∈ k∃w:W k}
and for a ∈ kMk
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.8516876">
kTϕ,∃w:W k(a) = {b ∈ kWk: ha, bi ∈ kLovek}
Step 2. We build dependent types from fibers.
�
kTϕ,∃w:W k = {{a} × kTϕ,∃w:W k(a) :
a ∈ kTϕ,∀m:M k}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999080588235294">
Thus the first sentence in (2) extends the con-
text Γ by adding the type Tϕ,∀m:M, interpreted
as kTϕ,∀m:M k (i.e. the set of men who love some
women), and the dependent type Tϕ,∃w:W (tϕ,∀m),
interpreted for a ∈ kTϕ,∀m:M k as kTϕ,∃w:W k(a)
(i.e. the set of women loved by the man a).
Unbound anaphoric pronouns are interpreted
with reference to the context created by the fore-
going text: they are treated as universal quantifiers
and newly formed (possibly dependent) types in-
crementally added to the context serve as their po-
tential quantificational domains. That is, unbound
anaphoric pronouns theym and themw in the sec-
ond sentence of (2) have the ability to pick up and
quantify universally over the respective interpreta-
tions. The anaphoric continuation in (2) translates
into:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.990726857142857">
Γϕ ` ∀tϕ,∀m:Tϕ,∀m:M |∀tϕ,∃w :Tϕ,∃w:W (tϕ,∀m)
Kiss(tϕ,∀m, tϕ,∃w),
where:
k∀tϕ,∀m:Tϕ,∀m:M |∀tϕ,∃w:Tϕ,∃w:W (tϕ,∀m)k =
{R ⊆ kTϕ,∃w:W k : {a ∈ kTϕ,∀m:M k :
{b ∈ kTϕ,∃w:W k(a) : ha, bi ∈ R} ∈
k∀tϕ,∃w:Tϕ,∃w:W (tϕ,∀m)k(a)} ∈ k∀tϕ,∀m:Tϕ,∀m:M k},
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.8969165">
yielding the correct truth conditions: Every man
kisses every woman he loves.
Our system also handles intra-sentential
anaphora, as exemplified in (3):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.980624">
(3) Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996556714285714">
To account for the dynamic contribution of modi-
fied common nouns (in this case common nouns
modified by relative clauses) we include in our
system ∗-sentences (i.e. sentences with dummy
quantifier phrases). The modified common noun
gets translated into a ∗-sentence (with a dummy-
quantifier phrase f : F):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.811573">
Γ ` f : F|∃d:DOwn(f,d)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9676656">
and we extend the context by dropping the speci-
fications of variables: (f : F, d : D) and adding
new variable specifications on newly formed types
for every (dummy-) quantifier phrase in the chain
Ch∗:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.944729">
tϕ,f : Tϕ,f:F; tϕ,∃d : Tϕ,∃d:D(tϕ,f),
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9973018">
The interpretations of types (that correspond to the
quantifier phrases in the Ch∗) from the extended
context Γϕ are defined in our two-step procedure.
Thus the ∗-sentence in (3) extends the context by
adding the type Tϕ,f:F interpreted as kTϕ,f:Fk
(i.e. the set of farmers who own some donkeys),
and the dependent type Tϕ,∃d:D(tϕ,f), interpreted
for a ∈ kTϕ,f:F k as kTϕ,∃d:Dk(a) (i.e. the set of
donkeys owned by the farmer a). The main clause
translates into:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5755735">
Γϕ ` ∀tϕ,f:Tϕ,f:F |∀tϕ,∃d:Tϕ,∃d:D (tϕ,f)
Beat(tϕ,f, tϕ,∃d),
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997304888888889">
yielding the correct truth conditions Every farmer
who owns a donkey beats every donkey he owns.
Importantly, since we quantify over fibers (and not
over hfarmer, donkeyi pairs), our solution does
not run into the so-called ‘proportion problem’.
Dynamic extensions of contexts and their in-
terpretation are also defined for cumulative and
branching continuations. Consider a cumulative
example in (4):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99587">
(4) Last year three scientists wrote (a total of) five
articles (between them). They presented them
at major conferences.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7558515">
Interpreted cumulatively, the first sentence in (4)
translates into a sentence:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.81737">
Γ ` (Threes:S, Fivea:A) Write(s, a).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993185">
The anaphoric continuation in (4) can be inter-
preted in what Krifka calls a ‘correspondence’
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993084">

<bodyText confidence="0.999932125">
fashion (Krifka, 1996). For example, Dr. K wrote
one article, co-authored two more with Dr. N, who
co-authored two more with Dr. S, and the scien-
tists that cooperated in writing one or more articles
also cooperated in presenting these (and no other)
articles at major conferences. In our system, the
first sentence in (4) extends the context by adding
the type corresponding to (Threes:S, Fivea:A):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.883589">
tW,(Three3,Fivea) : TW,(Three3:S; Fivea:A),
interpreted as a set of tuples
I ITW,(Three3:S,Fivea:A)I I =
= {(c, d) : c E I ISI I &amp; d E I IAI I &amp; c wrote d}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998936">
The anaphoric continuation then quantifies univer-
sally over this type (i.e. a set of pairs), yielding the
desired truth-conditions The respective scientists
cooperated in presenting at major conferences the
respective articles that they cooperated in writing.

The variables the types depend on are always
explicitly written down in specifications. We can

Quantifier-free formulas. Here, we need only
predicates applied to variables. So we write

Quantifier phrases. If we have a context Γ, y :
Y (~x), Δ and quantifier symbol Q, then we can
form a quantifier phrase Qy:Y (~x) in that context.
We write
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.867459">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997376428571429">

the variable y is the binding variable and the vari-
ables x~ are indexing variables.
Packs of quantifiers. Quantifiers phrases can
be grouped together to form a pack of quantifiers.
The pack of quantifiers formation rule is as fol-
lows.

<equation confidence="0.9993355">

constructed pack: the binding variables are y~ and
the indexing variables are ~x. We can denote such
a pack Pc~y:~Y (~x) to indicate the variables involved.
One-element pack will be denoted and treated as
a quantifier phrase. This is why we denote such a
pack as Qy:Y (~x) rather than (Qy:Y (~x)).
Pre-chains and chains of quantifiers. Chains
and pre-chains of quantifiers have binding vari-
ables and indexing variables. By Ch~y:~Y (~x) we de-
note a pre-chain with binding variables y~ and in-
dexing variables x~ so that the type of the variable
yi is Yi(~xi) with Ui ~xi = ~x. Chains of quantifiers
are pre-chains in which all indexing variables are
bound. Pre-chains of quantifiers arrange quantifier
phrases into N-free pre-orders, subject to some
binding conditions. Mutually comparable QPs in a
pre-chain sit in one pack. Thus the pre-chains are
built from packs via two chain-constructors of se-
quential ?|? and parallel composition ??. The chain
formation rules are as follows.

Like Dekker’s Predicate Logic with Anaphora and more recent multidimensional models (Dekker, 1994); (Dekker, 2008), our system lends itself to the compositional treatment of unbound anaphora, while keeping a classical, static notion of truth. The main novelty of our proposal consists in combining generalized quantifiers (Mostowski, 1957); (Lindstr¨om, 1966); (Barwise and Cooper, 1981) with dependent types (Martin-L¨of, 1972); (Ranta, 1994). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce informally the main features of our system. Section 3 sketches the process of Englishto-formal language translation. Finally, sections 4 and 5 define the syntax and semantics of the system. 2 Elements of system 2.1 Context, types and dependent types The variables of our system are always typed.

The semantical operations that correspond to the chainconstructors (known as cumulation, iteration and branching) capture in a compositional manner cumulative, scope-dependent and branching readings, respectively. The idea of chain-constructors and the corresponding semantical operations builds on Mostowski’s notion of quantifier (Mostowski, 1957) further generalized by Lindstr¨om to a so-called polyadic quantifier (Lindstr¨om, 1966), see (Bellert and Zawadowski, 1989). To use a familiar example, a multi-quantifier prefix like ∀m:M|∃w:W is thought of as a single two-place quantifier obtained by an operation on the two single quantifiers, and it has as denotation: k∀m:M|∃w:Wk = {R ⊆ kMk × kWk:{a ∈ kMk: {b ∈ kWk: ha, bi ∈ R} ∈ k∃w:Wk} ∈ k∀m:Mk}. In this paper we generalize the three chainconstructors and the corresponding semantical operations to (pre-) chains defined on dependent types. 2.3 Dynamic extensions of contexts In our system language expressions are all defined in context.

The main kinds of unbound anaphora are regular anaphora to quantifiers, quantificational subordination, and donkey anaphora, as exemplified by (1) to (3) respectively: (1) Most kids entered. They looked happy. (2) Every man loves a woman. They kiss them. (3) Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it. Unbound anaphoric pronouns have been dealt with in two main semantic paradigms: dynamic semantic theories (Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1991); (Van den Berg, 1996); (Nouwen, 2003) and the E-type/D-type tradition (Evans, 1977); (Heim, 1990); (Elbourne, 2005). In the dynamic semantic theories pronouns are taken to be (syntactically free, but semantically bound) variables, and context serves as a medium supplying values for the variables. In the E-type/D-type tradition pronouns are treated as quantifiers. Our system combines aspects of both families of theories. As in the Etype/D-type tradition we treat unbound anaphoric pronouns as quantifiers; as in the systems of dynamic semantics context is used as a medium supplying (possibly dep</context>

Dynamic extensions of contexts and their interpretation are also defined for cumulative and branching continuations. Consider a cumulative example in (4): (4) Last year three scientists wrote (a total of) five articles (between them). They presented them at major conferences. Interpreted cumulatively, the first sentence in (4) translates into a sentence: Γ ` (Threes:S, Fivea:A) Write(s, a). The anaphoric continuation in (4) can be interpreted in what Krifka calls a ‘correspondence’ 12 fashion (Krifka, 1996). For example, Dr. K wrote one article, co-authored two more with Dr. N, who co-authored two more with Dr. S, and the scientists that cooperated in writing one or more articles also cooperated in presenting these (and no other) articles at major conferences. In our system, the first sentence in (4) extends the context by adding the type corresponding to (Threes:S, Fivea:A): tW,(Three3,Fivea) : TW,(Three3:S; Fivea:A), interpreted as a set of tuples I ITW,(Three3:S,Fivea:A)I I = = {(c, d) : c E I ISI I &amp; d E I IAI I &amp; c wrote d} The anaphoric continuation then quantifies universally over this ty</context>

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99996195">
An established method for MWE extrac-
tion is the combined use of previously iden-
tified POS-patterns and association mea-
sures. However, the selection of such POS-
patterns is rarely debated. Focusing on Ital-
ian MWEs containing at least one adjec-
tive, we set out to explore how candidate
POS-patterns listed in relevant literature
and lexicographic sources compare with
POS sequences exhibited by statistically
significant n-grams including an adjective
position extracted from a large corpus of
Italian. All literature-derived patterns are
found—and new meaningful candidate pat-
terns emerge—among the top-ranking tri-
grams for three association measures. We
conclude that a final solid set to be used for
MWE extraction will have to be further re-
fined through a combination of association
measures as well as manual inspection.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998875">
The CombiNet project1 has the goal of building
an online resource for Word Combinations in Ital-
ian, including MWEs of various degrees of fixed-
ness (such as phrasal lexemes, collocations and
usual combinations) as well as distributional pro-
files of Italian lexemes. Within this project, the
present paper aims at investigating ways to refine
a well-known methodology for MWE-extraction,
namely the combined use of previously identified
POS-patterns and association measures (Evert and
Krenn, 2005). While POS-patterns are widely used
to extract MWEs from corpora in order to constrain
the array of possible outputs (Krenn and Evert,
2001; Wermter and Hahn, 2006, e.g.), the way in
which POS-patterns are created in the first place is
much less addressed. This step is however crucial,

especially considering that the list of patterns is
necessarily language-specific. The goal of this pa-
per is to propose a method to optimize – in terms of
both recall and precision – the list of POS patterns
to be used for the subsequent extraction of potential
MWEs. In order to do this, we compare predeter-
mined patterns, which would be normally used as
a first-pass sieve for potential MWEs, with pat-
terns exhibited by statistically significant n-grams
extracted from data.

2 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950615384615">
In this pilot study, we focus on MWEs containing
at least one adjective, and we limit the extraction
to trigrams (Section 2.1). We make use of the
following sets of data: (a) a list of frequently used
Italian adjectives; (b) a list of previously identified
POS-patterns containing at least one adjective.2
The adjectival lemmas were taken from the
Senso Comune dictionary,3 which contains 2,010
fundamental lemmas of the Italian lexicon, 211 of
which are adjectives (e.g. bello “beautiful”, brutto
“ugly”, ricco “rich”). These adjectives are used to
constrain the extraction procedure, and we refer to
this set as {SC}.
The list of predetermined POS-patterns for
MWEs involving one adjective was obtained by
merging the following information: (a) patterns
of word combinations included in existing com-
binatory dictionaries for Italian (Piunno et al.,
2013), see Table 1a; (b) additional combinatory
types mentioned in the relevant theoretical litera-
ture (Voghera, 2004; Masini, 2012), summarised
in Table 1b; and (c) a few more patterns based on
our own intuition, i.e. identified by elaborating on
the previous two lists (Table 2). This joint collec-
tion contains a total of 19 patterns, most of which
are bigrams (11), and fewer are trigrams (8). Note

that trigrams (put together in Table 2) come for the
most part from our intuition, indicating that these
patterns are rather neglected in the literature and
in combinatory dictionaries of Italian, which tend
to focus on bigrams. For this reason, and because
longer sequences are intrinsically more idiosyn-
cratic, we concentrate on trigrams for this pilot
experiment, although in the discussion we take into
account bigrams, too (Section 3).

2.1 Extracting the trigrams
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912055555556">
From the corpus La Repubblica (Baroni et al.,
2004), which consists of 300M words of newswire
contemporary Italian, we extracted all trigrams fea-
turing at least one adjective, deriving this informa-
tion from the pre-existing POS tags in the corpus.
All trigrams were extracted as sequences of lem-
mas. We created three separate lists according to
the adjective’s position in the trigram (first, second,
or third). All instances containing any punctuation
item were discarded.
For each of the three sets, we kept only trigrams
occurring more than five times in the whole cor-
pus. As a further step, we selected those instances
featuring one of the 211 adjectives in {SC}, yield-
ing a total of 89,217 different trigrams featuring
an adjective as first member (191 adjectives from
{SC} occur in this position), 100,861 as second
(192 adjectives), and 114,672 as third (193).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999771">
2.2 Ranking the trigrams
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883230769231">
We used the Text-NSP package (Banerjee and Ped-
ersen, 2003) to rank the trigrams in each of the
three sets according to three association measures
(AMs), namely the Poisson-Stirling measure (PS),
the log-likelihood ratio (LL) and pointwise mu-
tual information (PMI). However, on the basis of
preliminary inspection and observations in the liter-
ature on ranking Italian MWEs extracted from cor-
pora (Nissim and Zaninello, 2013), we discarded
PMI as not too accurate for this task. We also
considered raw frequencies, as they have proved
good indicators for collocations, on a par with AMs
(Krenn and Evert, 2001; Bannard, 2007).
The idea is to check which POS sequences are
exhibited by the highest instances in the rank, un-
der the rationale that such patterns might be good
representations of Italian MWEs containing adjec-
tives, and can be used for further extraction and
characterisation of the phenomenon (in dictionar-
ies and resources). Thus, we selected the top 10%
instances in each rank, extracted their POS patterns,
and ranked such patterns according to the number
of times they appeared. Tables 3–5 report the ten
most frequent patterns according to each measure,
when an adjective is found in first, second, and
third position, respectively.

3 Analysis and discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998">
By comparing the ranked patterns in Tables 3–5
with the predetermined POS-patterns for trigrams
in Table 2, we draw the following observations.
We first consider patterns that are ranked high
for all measures. Some find a correspondence to
those in Table 2, implying that these are likely to
be solid, characteristic POS sequences to be used
in extraction (ADJ CONJ ADJ (for ADJ in first
position), ADJ PRE VER, PRE ADJ NOUN, and
VER PRE ADJ). Other found patterns, instead, are
not among the pre-identified ones, but are definitely
typical sequences, as the analysis of some of the
extracted trigrams shows. Among these: ADJ PRE
NOUN (ospite d’onore “special guest”), VER ART
ADJ (essere il solo “to be the only one”), NOUN
PRE ADJ (agente in borghese “plain-clothes po-
liceman”), ARTPRE ADJ NOUN (all’ultimo mo-
mento “at the last moment”). Envisaging an ex-
traction procedure based on POS sequences, such
structures should be included to improve recall.
Conversely, the PRE ART ADJ pattern exhibits
an incomplete sequence, and is therefore unsuitable
for MWE extraction. Since the inclusion of such
patterns would possibly affect precision, they need
to be filtered out on the grounds of grammatical

constraints, or, ultimately, manual inspection.
Additionally, there are patterns that contain or
are portions of more relevant patterns for MWE-
hood. Some capture what are in fact bigrams (Ta-
ble 6), while others are portions of 4-grams or
possibly larger sequences, namely NOUN ADJ
PRE (NOUN), (NOUN) ADJ ARTPRE NOUN,
and NOUN ARTPRE ADJ (NOUN), where the
“missing” POS is given in brackets. Examples are:
concorso esterno in (omicidio) “external partici-
pation in (murder)”, (banca) nazionale del lavoro
“National (Bank) of Labour”, and paese del terzo
(mondo) “third world (country)”, respectively. Run-
ning a full-scale extraction procedure that accounts
for all n-grams should naturally take care of this.
Some of patterns from Table 2 are ranked high
only by some measures: PRE NOUN ADJ only
according to PS and raw frequency (Table 5), and
NOUN ADJ ADJ both for second and third po-
sition, but only by PS. Overall, with respect to
their ability to extract previously identified POS-
patterns, AMs perform similarly when the adjective
is the first member (Table 3), whereas PS seems
to be more indicative when the adjective is second
and third (Tables 4-5), together with raw frequency,
while LL seems to be generally performing the
worst. This point calls for a combination of AMs
(Pecina, 2008), but will require further work.
As for predetermined patterns that are not found
among the top ones, we observe that NOUN NOUN
ADJ is basically an adjective modifying a noun-
noun compound, and should be best treated as a
“complex bigram”. Similarly, the PRE ADJ VER
pattern can be seen as an extension of the ADJ VER
bigram, which is usually not considered (Table 1).
Investigating the combination of bigrams, trigrams
and n-grams with n&gt;3 is left for future work.

tion to improve recall. At the same time, several
patterns extracted with this technique are to be dis-
carded. Some are just irrelevant (e.g. ADJ CHE
CLI, nero the le “black that them”): in this respect,
combining various AMs or setting grammatical
constraints could help refine precision, but human
intervention also seems unavoidable. Others are
not meaningful trigrams as such, but may be mean-
ingful as parts of larger MWEs or because they
contain meaningful bigrams. Here, it would be in-
teresting to explore how to combine n-grams with
different n-values.
This pilot experiment shows that trigram ranking
is useful to extract new patterns that are not consid-
ered in the initial set. The latter can be therefore
expanded by following the proposed methodology,
as a preliminary step towards the actual extraction
of candidate MWEs from corpora. Clearly, the va-
lidity of the expanded POS-pattern set can only be
evaluated after the extraction step is completed.

All trigrams were extracted as sequences of lemmas. We created three separate lists according to the adjective’s position in the trigram (first, second, or third). All instances containing any punctuation item were discarded. For each of the three sets, we kept only trigrams occurring more than five times in the whole corpus. As a further step, we selected those instances featuring one of the 211 adj</context>

Within this project, the present paper aims at investigating ways to refine a well-known methodology for MWE-extraction, namely the combined use of previously identified POS-patterns and association measures (Evert and Krenn, 2005). While POS-patterns are widely used to extract MWEs from corpora in order to constrain the array of possible outputs (Krenn and Evert, 2001; Wermter and Hahn, 2006, e.g.), the way in which POS-patterns are created in the first place is much less addressed.

Some of patterns from Table 2 are ranked high only by some measures: PRE NOUN ADJ only according to PS and raw frequency (Table 5), and NOUN ADJ ADJ both for second and third position, but only by PS. Overall, with respect to their ability to extract previously identified POSpatterns, AMs perform similarly when the adjective is the first member (Table 3), whereas PS seems to be more indicative when the adjective is second and third (Tables 4-5), together with raw frequency, while LL seems to be generally performing the worst. This point calls for a combination of AMs (Pecina, 2008), but will require further work. As for predetermined patterns that are not found among the top ones, we observe that NOUN NOUN ADJ is basically an adjective modifying a nounnoun compound, and should be best treated as a “complex bigram”. Similarly, the PRE ADJ VER pattern can be seen as an extension of the ADJ VER bigram, which is usually not considered (Table 1). Investigating the combination of bigrams, trigrams and n-grams with n&gt;3 is left for future work. 4 Conclusion In summary, basically all of the literature/intuitionbased patterns are retrieved from highly ranked plain trigrams.

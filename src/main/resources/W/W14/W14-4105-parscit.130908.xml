This paper explores the cognitive presence
of the learners in MOOCs through using a
(computational) linguistic analysis of the
learners’ Point-of-View as an indicator for
cognitive presence. The linguistic analysis
of the written language as a medium of
interaction by the students in the context of

<bodyText confidence="0.999952068965517">
The popularity of Massive Open Online
Courses (henceforth MOOCs) is expanding,
and the perceived educational add-value of
their scalability to the masses is growing.
However, research shows that MOOCs do not
generate enough opportunities for students’
interaction and retention (see: Kizilcec et al
(2013), Yang et al (2013), Rosé et al (2014),
Wen et al (2014b). The large scale linguistic
data that is generated by discussion boards,
blogs, and other written language-based
interaction tools that are/can be part of the
MOOC technology infrastructure provides an
unprecedented opportunity to study the
dynamics of students’ interaction, learning
engagement, and ways in which critical
valuable learning/teaching discourse is
constructed around different knowledge
topics.
This paper presents an exploratory
approach to examine students’ learning-based
inquiry within the context of MOOCs through
analyzing the linguistic aspects of Point-of-
View as an indicator of cognitive presence.
This approach is theoretically grounded in
linguistics (natural syntax) and educationally
understood along the lines of the Community
of Inquiry Framework (Garrison et al (2000),
Garrison et al (2001), Swan et al (2009)).

2.1. Point-of-View: a linguistics perspective
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998721">
I assume that the structure and the
interpretation of Point-of-View as a linguistic
construct is detected and interpreted through
its compositional parts. The compositional
parts of Point-of-View include notions such as:
subjectivity, belief mitigation, evidentiality and
epistemic mood (Speas and Tenny 2003,
Elouazizi 2014). The notion of subjectivity
refers to the way a speaker expresses
knowledge gained through personal/internal
experience-“ontological subjectivity” (Searle
2004). The notion of (belief) mitigation is
linguistically conveyed through the use of a
specific set of epistemic parenthetical verbs
such as: think, believe (Urmson (1952)).
In addition to the use of belief mitigation
verbs, and subjectivity linguistic devices, a
speaker’s point of view is also indicated by the
degree of their use of evidential verbs that
carry epistemic propositional attitudes, such
as: I feel, I sense, I see. A subject/speaker uses
evidentiality linguistic devices (verbs, adverbs)
to evaluate the degree of certainty in a
proposition by matching the source of the
information and the target of the information
(Speas 2008).
In addition to these linguistic devices,
Point-of-View can also be conveyed through
the use of a set of epistemic mood and
discourse adverbs. This includes adverbs such
as: frankly, presumably, supposedly, probably,
luckily, realistically. These adverbs provide
additional information about the propositional
attitude of the speaker.
Taken jointly, the combination of these
linguistic constructs constitutes a lexical
structure (lexicon), with a latent syntax of
Point-of-View, and which can lend itself to the
techniques of text mining and computational
linguistic analysis.

2.2. Point-of-View: a learning perspective
Defined in broad terms, learning events are the
set of “activities” and “acts” that the learner
engages in so as to ensure the acquisition,
transfer and modification of knowledge, skills
and beliefs (Skinner (1968), Piaget (1952),
Gagné (1985), Mayer (1996)). These (learning)
activities and acts could be internal (mental)
or/and external (behaviours) and could include
more than one cognitive modality for
processing information. These modalities
include: auditory modality, visual modality,
haptic modality, and linguistic modality. Each
of these cognitive modalities produces data
(information) that can be studied to infer
whether and how learning occurs.
My focus here is on the linguistic
modality, and how it is used to interface the
components of an educational/learning
experience, as understood within the context of
the Community of Inquiry model for learning
(see: Garrison et al (2000) and Garrison et al
(2001)). Perceived from the perspective of the
Community of Inquiry (CoI) model, I propose
that the analysis of Point-of-View is a way to
examine the nature of the supporting discourse
that is crucial in interfacing the social
presence, the cognitive presence, and the
teaching presence (as illustrated in the adapted
Figure in 1).

FIGURE 1: Community of Inquiry (CoI) model
(Adapted from: Garrison et al 2000)
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995925">
One of the central aspects of CoI is “cognitive
presence”. This refers to the “extent to which
the participating learners in any particular
configuration of a community of inquiry are
able to construct meaning through sustained
communication.” (Garrison et al, Swan et al
(2009)). I explore the cognitive presence of the
MOOC’s learners through the analysis of
Point-of-View’s usage, clustering and
dispersions in the written language-based
interactions, generated by the learners in the
context of MOOCs.

This paper uses two data sets of written

blogs discussions of three MOOC courses,
attended by 3000 learners, and English
language was the language of interaction in
these MOOCs. The second set of data comes
from the discussion board of a large online
university course, delivered to a large class of
300 students, using English language. The
written corpus data from the three MOOCs
contains 724955 words, and the corpus data
from the non-MOOC online course contains
727205 words.

3.2. Point-of-View extraction: the approach
One central non-trivial challenge with the
computational extraction of the linguistic
patterns from written text is the issue of
classification and feature structures. The term
classification is generally construed broadly to
encompass the architecture and the structure of
the systems and features used in extracting
interpretative patterns such as opinions and
sentiments from written text (Riloff and Wiebe
(2003), Pang and Lee (2004)). There are
different approaches to extraction to guide the
computational process of automatically
extracting patterns from text.
For example, the approach of polarity-
based classification encompasses regression
and ranking of the lexical units. This approach
is exploited in sentiment analysis and it
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995175">
33
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998056375">
assumes that the text is underlined by an
opinion towards which an agent expresses a
positive or negative feeling (see: Pang et al.
(2002), Eguchi and Lavrenko (2006)).
Another approach is the gradability-based
classification. In this approach the lexical units
are not attributed a polar classification. Rather,
the text is classified in terms of gradable terms.
This approach is used in automatic extraction
of subjectivity from the text (Wiebe et al.
(2001), Wilson et al. (2005), Yu and
Hatzivassiloglou (2003)).
I build on the insights of polarity-based
and gradability-based approaches to automatic
extraction and processing of text and propose
the classification in Figure 2.

<figureCaption confidence="0.785533">
FIGURE 2: The classification features structure of
Point-of-View
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999536117647059">
The classification and features structure in
Figure 2 enables the extraction of a bundle of
attitudes and belief as it uses a combination of
parts of speech that encompass latent
knowledge and interpretations, as exhibited in
the syntax and the semantics of the constructs
that compose Point-of-View. As such, Point-
of-View mining and automatic analysis is at
the intersection of opinion mining and
subjectivity mining. This approach (Point-of-
View mining) seeks to extract perspective-
related information such as opinion holders,
belief mitigation, and propositional attitudes
(for similar but not identical approaches, see:
Kudo and Matsumoto (2004), Dave et al
(2003), Riloff and Wiebe (2003), Song et al
2007, El-Halees (2011)).

4. Results and discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857210526316">
Recall that the main goal of this paper is to
explore the cognitive presence of the learners
in MOOCs through their written language
input, and using a linguistics analysis of the
learners’ Point-of-View as an indicator for
cognitive presence. I hypothesize that if the
learners in MOOCs are cognitively
disengaged, the frequency and usage of Point-
of-View components (as identified in Figure 2)
would be low. Conversely, if the frequency
and usage of Point-of-View components is
higher, that would imply that the students in
MOOCs are cognitively engaged and their
cognitive presence is more asserted.
The Point-of-View usage data, as
illustrated in FIGURE 3, shows that the use of
belief mitigation devices (verbs such as: think,
believe, guess and suppose) is equally low in
all the three MOOCs.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.90273">
FIGURE 3: The usage of POV/cognitive presence
in MOOCs
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971105263158">
However, in all the three MOOCs, subjectivity
is attested with varying degrees. This indicates
that the learners do express their stance in their
blog discussions but without engaging in any
epistemic interactions with other learners. This
is the case because the uses of the mitigation
construct, of the evidentiality construct, and of
the epistemic mood construct by a speaker
(learner) always requires predicating on, hence
interacting with previously mentioned/stated
proposition. The data in Figure 3 indicates that
the learners did not modify the propositions
that were put forward by other learners or
convey changes in propositional attitudes, or
mitigate beliefs, expressed in the text of the
MOOCs blogs.
These observations are further supported
by the dispersion and clustering analysis of the
data, as illustrated in Figure 4.

Assuming that “support discourse” within the
context of the CoI framework is crucial in
interfacing the cognitive presence, the social
presence and the teaching presence of the
learner within an educational experience (see
FIGURE 1 above), the use of written language
as a medium of interaction by the students in
the context of MOOCs shows hallmarks of
cognitive disengagement and low cognitive
presence. That this is indeed the case is further
indicated by the Point-of-View comparative
data that illustrates the use of Point-of-View in
the context of a MOOC versus its use in the
context of a non-MOOC online course.
Consider the differences in the Point-of-
View usage, dispersion and clustering between
the data set of a single MOOC ccourse and that
of a non-MOOC online course, as illustrated
by Figure 5 and Figure 6 below. The Point-of-
View usage comparative data illustrated in
Figure 5 indicates that the cognitive presence
and engagement of the learners in the non-
MOOC online course is significantly higher
than in the MOOC courses.

FIGURE 5: The usage of POV/cognitive presence in
a MOOC vs. non-MOOC online course
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883230769231">
The learners in the non-MOOC online course
produced linguistic structures that contain
speech acts of expressing subjective views, of
mitigating aforementioned propositions
(beliefs) in the discourse and of providing
evidence of a statement as indicated through
the use of evidential adverbs. However, the
language (linguistic structures) used by the
learners in a single MOOC course shows
higher level of subjective use than the non-
MOOC course but significantly lower usage of
speech acts that express mitigation of beliefs or
evidentiality.
Furthermore, the usage of the Point-of-
View in the non-MOOC online course shows
that the learners expressed higher subjectivity,
accompanied with higher rates of belief
mitigation. This suggests that the learners in
the non-MOOC online course were more
cognitively engaged and they actively engaged
in invoking the discourse structures that
support the interfacing of cognitive presence,
teaching presence and social presence. These
observations are further supported by the
Point-of-View dispersion and clustering data
represented in Figure 6.

<bodyText confidence="0.999952266666667">
All in all, the data above indicates that learners
within the context of MOOCs exhibit less
cognitive presence than their counter part
learners in a non-MOOC online course. The
linguistic structures used by the learners in the
context of a MOOC course, at least on the
basis of the data examined in this paper,
indicate that they did not mitigate and attach
evidential statements to as many propositions
as in a non-MOOC course. For a speaker to
mitigate a proposition, the speaker first needs
to be aware of the proposition, the agent who
proposed or enacted such a proposition before
mitigating it. Hence, the more a speaker
mitigates hers or the propositions of others, the

more the speaker is engaged with the discourse
constructed around different knowledge topics.
These findings square with and confirm
observations established in other studies which
analyze the learners’ engagement in MOOCs.
For example, Wen et al. (2014a) and Wen et al
(2014b), using a survival model, and drawing
on linguistic data in discussion posts, show
that learners’ engagement in MOOCs reduces
drastically after week three in a MOOC course.

5. Conclusion and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978730769231">
This paper explored the use of a computational
linguistic perspective to mine and exploit the
latent knowledge in the Point-of-View
construct to examine the cognitive presence
and engagement of the students in the context
of MOOC and non-MOOC courses. As the
results show, the linguistic analysis of the
written language as a medium of interaction by
the learners in the context of MOOCs shows
hallmarks of cognitive disengagement and low
cognitive presence by the learners.
However, what emerges in the context of
this exploratory paper is a partial
representation of the learning-based discourse
structure within MOOCs and is by no means
conclusive of the way discourse structures are
constructed around different knowledge topics
within the context of a MOOC vs. a non-
MOOC online course. The empirical testing of
the classification in Figure 2, from a text
mining and automatic extraction perspective is
yet to be validated on larger (fully) annotated
MOOCs data sets, and using larger integrated
lexicons that combine a Point-of-View latent
knowledge lexicon and a MOOCs specific
education experience lexicon.

The linguistic analysis of the written language as a medium of interaction by the students in the context of MOOCs shows hallmarks of cognitive disengagement and low cognitive presence by the learners. 1. Introduction The popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (henceforth MOOCs) is expanding, and the perceived educational add-value of their scalability to the masses is growing. However, research shows that MOOCs do not generate enough opportunities for students’ interaction and retention (see: Kizilcec et al (2013), Yang et al (2013), Rosé et al (2014), Wen et al (2014b). The large scale linguistic data that is generated by discussion boards, blogs, and other written language-based interaction tools that are/can be part of the MOOC technology infrastructure provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the dynamics of students’ interaction, learning engagement, and ways in which critical valuable learning/teaching discourse is constructed around different knowledge topics.

In addition to the use of belief mitigation verbs, and subjectivity linguistic devices, a speaker’s point of view is also indicated by the degree of their use of evidential verbs that carry epistemic propositional attitudes, such as: I feel, I sense, I see. A subject/speaker uses evidentiality linguistic devices (verbs, adverbs) to evaluate the degree of certainty in a proposition by matching the source of the information and the target of the information (Speas 2008). In addition to these linguistic devices, Point-of-View can also be conveyed through the use of a set of epistemic mood and discourse adverbs. This includes adverbs such as: frankly, presumably, supposedly, probably, luckily, realistically. These adverbs provide additional information about the propositional attitude of the speaker. Taken jointly, the combination of these linguistic constructs constitutes a lexical structure (lexicon), with a latent syntax of Point-of-View, and which can lend itself to the techniques of text mining and computational linguistic analysis. 32 Proceedings of the </context>

This approach is theoretically grounded in linguistics (natural syntax) and educationally understood along the lines of the Community of Inquiry Framework (Garrison et al (2000), Garrison et al (2001), Swan et al (2009)). 2. Background 2.1. Point-of-View: a linguistics perspective I assume that the structure and the interpretation of Point-of-View as a linguistic construct is detected and interpreted through its compositional parts. The compositional parts of Point-of-View include notions such as: subjectivity, belief mitigation, evidentiality and epistemic mood (Speas and Tenny 2003, Elouazizi 2014). The notion of subjectivity refers to the way a speaker expresses knowledge gained through personal/internal experience-“ontological subjectivity” (Searle 2004). The notion of (belief) mitigation is linguistically conveyed through the use of a specific set of epistemic parenthetical verbs such as: think, believe (Urmson (1952)). In addition to the use of belief mitigation verbs, and subjectivity linguistic devices, a speaker’s point of view is also indicated by the degree of their use of evidential verbs that carry epistemic propositional attitudes, such as: I feel, I sense, </context>

A subject/speaker uses evidentiality linguistic devices (verbs, adverbs) to evaluate the degree of certainty in a proposition by matching the source of the information and the target of the information (Speas 2008). In addition to these linguistic devices, Point-of-View can also be conveyed through the use of a set of epistemic mood and </context>

The linguistic analysis of the written language as a medium of interaction by the students in the context of MOOCs shows hallmarks of cognitive disengagement and low cognitive presence by the learners. 1. Introduction The popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (henceforth MOOCs) is expanding, and the perceived educational add-value of their scalability to the masses is growing. However, research shows that MOOCs do not generate enough opportunities for students’ interaction and retention (see: Kizilcec et al (2013), Yang et al (2013), Rosé et al (2014), Wen et al (2014b). The large scale linguistic data that is generated by discussion boards, blogs, and other written language-based interaction tools that are/can be part of the MOOC technology infrastructure provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the dynamics of students’ interaction, learning engagement, and ways in which critical valuable learning/teaching discourse is constructed around different knowledge topics.

For a speaker to mitigate a proposition, the speaker first needs to be aware of the proposition, the agent who proposed or enacted such a proposition before mitigating it. Hence, the more a speaker mitigates hers or the propositions of others, the 35 more the speaker is engaged with the discourse constructed around different knowledge topics. These findings square with and confirm observations established in other studies which analyze the learners’ engagement in MOOCs. For example, Wen et al. (2014a) and Wen et al (2014b), using a survival model, and drawing on linguistic data in discussion posts, show that learners’ engagement in MOOCs reduces drastically after week three in a MOOC course. 5. Conclusion and future work This paper explored the use of a computational linguistic perspective to mine and exploit the latent knowledge in the Point-of-View construct to examine the cognitive presence and engagement of the students in the context of MOOC and non-MOOC courses.

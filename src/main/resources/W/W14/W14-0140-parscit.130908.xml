This work describes the evaluations of two ap-
proaches, Lexical Matching and Sense Sim-
ilarity, for word sense alignment between
MultiWordNet and a lexicographic dictio-
nary, Senso Comune De Mauro, when having
few sense descriptions (MultiWordNet) and
no structure over senses (Senso Comune De

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964657142857">
This work is situated in the field of word sense
alignment, a research area which has seen an
increasing interest in recent years and which is
a key requirement for achieving semantic inter-
operability between different lexical-semantic re-
sources (Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013). Our
goal is to automatically import high-quality
glosses in Italian in MultiWordNet (Pianta et al.,
2002) (MWN) by aligning its synsets to the entries
of a lexicographic dictionary, namely the Senso
Comune De Mauro (SCDM), thus providing Ital-
ian with a more complete and robust version of
MWN. For SCDM, the linking of the entries with
MWN plays a double role. On the one hand, it will
introduce lexical-semantic relations, thus facilitat-
ing its use for NLP tasks in Italian, and, on the
other hand, it will make SCDM a structurally and
semantically interoperable resource for Italian, to
which other lexical-semantic resources (both in
Italian, such as PAROLE-SIMPLE-CLIPS (Ruimy
et al., 2003), and in English, such as VerbNet (Kip-
per Schuler, 2005), among others), sense anno-
tated corpora (e.g. the MultiSemCor corpus (Ben-
tivogli and Pianta, 2005)), and Web-based ency-
clopedia (e.g. Wikipedia) can be connected.
At this stage of development we focused on the
alignment of verbs and nouns. The remaining of
this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will
state the task and describe the characteristics of the
two lexica. In Section 3 some related works and
the perculiarities of our work are discussed. The
approaches we have adopted are described in Sec-
tion 4. The evaluation is carried out in Section 5,
including an error analysis. Finally, in Section 6
conclusions and future works are reported.

2 Problem Description and Resources
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999355416666667">
Following (Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013),
word sense alignment (WSA) can be formally
defined as a list of pairs of senses from two
lexical-semantic resources. A pair of aligned
senses denotes the same meaning. For in-
stance, taken the two senses of the word “day”
“amount of hours of work done in
one day and “the recurring hours
established by contract or usage
for work” (taken from translated SCDM and
MWN, respectively), they must be aligned as they
are clearly equivalent.

MWN is a computational multilingual lexicon per-
fectly aligned to Princeton WN 1.6. As in WN,
concepts are organized in synonym sets (synsets)
which are hierarchically connected by means of
hypernym relations (is a). Additional semantic
relations such as meronymy, troponymy, nearest
synonym and others are encoded as well. The
Italian section of MWN is composed of 38,653
synsets, with 4,985 synsets for verbs and 28,517
synsets for nouns. Each synset is accompanied by
a gloss describing its meaning and, when present,
one or more examples of use. Only 3,177 glosses
(8,21%) are in Italian and, in particular, 402 for
verbs and 2,481 for nouns.

Senso Comune aims at building an open knowl-
edge base for the Italian language, designed as a
crowd-sourced initiative that stands on the solid
ground of an ontological formalization and well-
established lexical resources. The lexicon entries
have been obtained from the De Mauro GRADIT
dictionary and consists in the 2,071 most frequent
Italian words, for a total of 11,939 fundamental
senses. As for verbs we have 3,827 senses, cor-
responding to 643 lemmas, with an average poly-
semy of 5.9 senses per lemma. As for nouns we
have 4,586 senses, corresponding to 1,111 lem-
mas with an average polysemy of 4.12 senses per
lemma. In SCDM, word senses are encoded fol-
lowing lexicographic principles and are associated
with lexicographic examples of usage.
Senso Comune comprises three modules: i.) a
top level module for basic ontological concepts;
ii.) a lexical module for linguistic and lexico-
graphic structures; and iii.) a frame module for
modeling the predicative structure of verbs and
nouns. The top level ontology is inspired by
DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and
Cognitive Engineering) (Masolo et al., 2002). All
nominal entries have been manually classified ac-
cording to the ontological concepts and an onto-
logical classification of verb entries will start in the
near future. With respect to MWN, word senses
are not hierarchically structured and no semantic
relation is encoded. Senses of polysemous entries
have a flat representation, one following the other.

<bodyText confidence="0.999895676923077">
Previous works in word sense alignment can be
divided into two main groups: a.) approaches and
frameworks which aim at linking lexica based on
different models to WN synsets (Rigau and Eneko
(1995); Navigli (2006); Roventini et al. (2007))
or language resources, such as Wikipedia (Ruiz-
Casado et al. (2005); Mihalcea (2007); Niemann
and Gurevych (2011)), and b.) approaches to-
wards the merging of different language resources
(Gurevych et al. (2012); Navigli and Ponzetto
(2012)). Our work clearly fits into the first group.
While different methods are employed (similarity-
based approaches vs. graph-based approaches),
common elements of these works are: i.) the
extensive use of lexical knowledge based on the
sense descriptions such as the WN glosses or an
article first paragraph as in the case of Wikipedia;
and ii.) the extension of the basic sense descrip-
tions with additional information such as hyper-
nyms for WN entries, domains labels or categories
for dictionaries or Wikipedia entries so as to ex-
pand the set of available information, thus improv-
ing the quality of the alignments.
As for our task, the most similar work is (Nav-
igli, 2006) where entries from a lexicographic dic-
tionary, namely the Oxford English Dictionary
(OED), are mapped to WN. The author adopts and
compares two methods: a.) a pure lexical match-
ing function based on the notion of lexical over-
lap (Lesk, 1986) of the lemmas in the sense de-
scriptions; and b.) a semantic matching based on
a knowledge-based WSD system, Structural Se-
mantic Interconnections (SSI), built upon WN and
enriched with collocation information represent-
ing semantic relatedness between sense pairs. In
this latter approach, first each sense description in
WN and in the OED is disambiguated by means of
SSI with respect to the WN sense inventory, thus
obtaining a semantic description as a bag of con-
cepts. Then, two senses are matched if a relation
edge is identified between the concepts in the de-
scription of each sense in the two lexica. Both
approaches are evaluated with respect to a man-
ually created gold standard. The author reports an
overall F1 measure of 73.84% for lexical match-
ing, and of 83.11% for semantic matching.
With respect to the SCDM, the OED has some
advantages, namely i.) the distinction between
core senses and subsenses for polysemous entries;
ii.) the presence of hypernyms explicitly sig-
nalled; and iii.) domain labels associated with
word senses. Such kind of information is not
present in the SCDM where senses are presented
as a flat list and no enrichment of the sense de-
scriptions with additional information is available,
except for the ontological tagging of nouns. More-
over, the low number of MWN glosses in Italian
prevents a straightforward application of state-of-
the-art methods for sense alignment. MWN sense
descriptions must be built up from other sources.
Thus, the main issue we are facing is related to
data sparseness, that is how to tackle sense align-
ment when we have few descriptions in Italian
(MWN side) and few meta-data and no structure
over senses (SCDM side).

In the first approach, Lexical Match, for each word
w and for each sense s in the given resources R
E {MWN, SCDM} we constructed a sense de-
scriptions dR(s) as a bag of words in Italian. Pro-
vided the different characteristics of the two re-
sources, two different types of bag of words have
been built. As for the SCDM, the bag of words is
represented by the lexical items in the textual def-
inition of s,,,, automatically lemmatized and part-
of-speech analyzed with the TextPro tool suite (Pi-
anta et al., 2008) with standard stopword removal.
On the other hand, for each synset, S, and for each
part of speech in analysis, the sense description of
each MWN synset was built by optionally exploit-

used Text::Similarity v.0.09 mod-
ule3, and in particular the method
Text::Similarity::Overlaps, to obtain
the overlap value between two bags of words
of s,,,. Text similarity is based on counting the
number of overlapping tokens between the two
strings, normalized by the length of the strings.
One of the well known limitation of the Lexical
Match approach is the so called “lexical gap”
problem (Meyer and Gurevych, 2011), i.e. a re-
duced number of overlapping words. To overcome
this limit, we have exploited a newly developed
multilingual resource, BabelNet (Navigli and
Ponzetto, 2012), which has been obtained by
merging together WN synsets and Wikipedia
pages with an accuracy of 83%. It contains
4,683,031 nominal glosses (2,985,243 of which
are in English). In BabelNet English WN 3.0
synsets have been aligned to their corresponding
Wikipedia pages and then extended to other lan-
guages, including Italian, by exploiting Wikipedia
language links and WN mappings. As for our
task, we have retained only those BabelNet
entries which have a corresponding synset word
in MWN. In this way, we have extended the bag
of words representation of nominal entries for
MWN synsets by adding the Italian Wikipedia
glosses from BabelNet.

In the second approach, Sense Similarity, the basis
for sense alignment is the Personalized Page Rank
(PPR) algorithm (Eneko and Soroa, 2009) rely-
ing on a lexical-semantic knowledge base model
as a graph G = (V, E) as available in the UKB
tool suite4. As knowledge base we have used
WN 3.0 extended with the “Princeton Annotated
Gloss Corpus”. Each vertex v of the graph is a
synset, and the edges represent semantic relations
between synsets (e.g. hyperonymy, hyponymy,
etc.). The PPR algorithm ranks the vertices in a
graph according to their importance within the set
and assigns stronger initial probabilities to certain
kinds of vertices in the graph. The result of the
PPR algorithm is a vector whose elements denotes
the probability for the corresponding vertex that a
jumper ends on that vertex if randomly following
the edges of the graph.

SCDM, we have translated the Italian textual def-
initions in English by means of a state-of-the-
art Machine Translation system5, automatically
lemmatized and part-of-speech analyzed with the
TextPro tool suite, remove standard stopwords and
applied the UKB tool suite. The PPR vector is a
thus semantic representation overall the entire WN
synsets of the textual definition of s in SCDM.
As for the MWN synsets, we have exploited
its conversion to WN 3.0. Instead of building the
PPR vector by means of the lexical items, we have
passed to the UKB tool suite the WN synset id,
thus assuming that the MWN synset is already dis-
ambiguated.
Given two PPR vectors, namely pprmwn and
pprscdm for the MWN synset wsyn and for the
SCDM sense wscdm, we calculated their cosine
similarity. On the basis of the similarity score, the
sense pair is considered as aligned or not.

5.1 Gold Standards

<bodyText confidence="0.999962423076923">
To evaluate the reliability of the two approaches
with respect to our data, we developed two dif-
ferent gold standards, one for verbs and one for
nouns.
The verb gold standard is composed by 44
lemmas selected according to corpus frequency
(highly frequent lemmas in the La Repubblica
Corpus (Baroni et al., 2004)) and patterns in terms
of semantic and syntactic features6. It is com-
posed by 350 aligned sense pairs obtained by man-
ually mapping the MWN synsets to their corre-
sponding senses in the SCDM lexicon. These
verbs corresponds to 279 synsets and 424 senses
in the SCDM. Overall, 211 of the 279 MWN
synsets have a corresponding sense in the SCDM
(i.e. SCDM covers 84.22% of the MWN senses in
the data set), while 235 out of 424 SCDM senses
have a correspondence in MWN (i.e MWN covers
49.76% of the SCDM senses). Average degree of
polysemy for MWN entries is 6.34, while for the
SCDM is 9.63.
The noun gold standard is composed by 46 lem-
mas selected according to frequency and poly-
semy with respect to the fundamental senses in
the SCDM (each lemma must have at least two
fundamental senses in the SCDM). On the basis

<bodyText confidence="0.999891090909091">
of the manual alignment, we have obtained 166
aligned sense pairs. The noun lemmas correspond
to 229 synsets and 216 senses in the SCDM. Over-
all, 134 of the 229 MWN synsets have a corre-
sponding sense in the SCDM (i.e. SCDM covers
53.71% of the MWN senses in the data set), while
123 out of 216 SCDM senses have a correspon-
dence in MWN (i.e MWN covers 62.03% of the
SCDM senses). Average degree of polysemy for
MWN entries is 4.97, while for the SCDM is 4.69.
The difference in terms of coverage with respect to
the verbs is clearly due to two aspects, namely i.)
the restrictions of the SCDM entries to the funda-
mental senses; ii.) the higher coverage in terms of
nouns synsets of MWN with respect to the verbal
ones.
Though small, the size of the gold standards is
representative of the two lexica. In particular, the
279 verbs synsets yield 3,319 possible sense pairs,
i.e. 11.8 SCDM senses per synset on average. As
for nouns, the 229 nominal synsets yield 1,414
sense pairs, i.e. 6.13 SCDM senses on average.

The evaluation has been performed by computing
Precision (the ratio of the correct alignment with
respect to all proposed alignments), Recall (the
ratio of extracted correct alignment with respect
to the alignments in the gold standard), F-measure
(the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall calcu-
lated as 2PR/P + R) and Accuracy (the precen-
tage of the correctly identifed alignments and non
alignments). As baseline, we have implemented a
random match algorithm, rand, which for the same
word w in SCDM and in MWN assigns a random
SCDM sense to each synset with w as synset word,
returning a one-to-one alignment. The selection of
the correct alignments has been obtained by apply-
ing two types of thresholds with respect to all pro-
posed alignments (the “no threshold” row in the
tables): i.) a simple cut-off at specified values (0.1;
0.2); ii.) the selection of the maximum score (ei-
ther lesk measure or cosine; row “max score” in
the tables) between each synset S and the proposed
aligned senses of the SCDM. As for the maximum
score threshold, we have retained as good align-
ments also instances of a tie, thus allowing the
possibility of having one MWN synset aligned to
more than one SCDM sense.

5.2.1 Lexical Match Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980958333334">
We have analyzed different combinations of the
sense representation of a synset. We developed
two basic representations: SYN, which is com-
posed by the set of synset words excluding the
target word w to be aligned, all of its direct hy-
pernyms, the set of synset words in MWN stand-
ing in the relation of nearest synonyms and the
synset words obtained from the “Princeton Anno-
tated Gloss Corpus”; and SREL, which contains
all the items of SYN plus the the synset words
included in the selected set of semantic relations.
The results are reported in Table 1.
As the figures show, all synset configurations
outperform the baseline rand for both parts of
speech in analysis. However, it is interesting to ob-
serve that the alignment of noun senses performs
much better than that for verbs in both sense rep-
resentations and with all filtering methods. On the
basis of the alignment method (i.e. lexical overlap)
such a difference in performance provides interest-
ing data on the two resources in analysis. A man-
ual exploration of the data in the configurations
both for verbs and nouns has highlighted that, on
the one hand, we suffer from data sparseness on
the SCDM side as no extension of the sense de-
scription of the glosses is possible, and, on the
other hand, that senses are described in ways that
are semantically equivalent but with different lex-
ical items.
As for verbs the Recall with no filtering
(no threshold) has extremely low levels, ranging
from 0.32 for SREL to 0.29 for SYN. The SREL
sense representation outperforms SYN when no
filtering is applied only in terms of Recall (+0.03),
thus signaling that the additional semantic rela-
tions play a very limited role in the description
of verb senses without providing real additional
information to match data in the SCDM glosses.
Furthermore, the difference in performance of the
SREL configuration is not statistically significant
with respect to the SYN configuration (p &gt; 0.05).
The situation looks different for nouns where,
although low, the no threshold Recall values range
between 0.60 (SREL) to 0.59 (for SYN). As for
the two basic configurations, SYN and SREL, the
results show that SYN is more accurate and that
the impact of additional semantic relations, though
it slightly improves the Recall, is not statistically
signiticant (p &gt; 0.05).
Both for verbs and nouns we decided to select
the SYN basic configuration as the best sense rep-
resentation because it has a simpler bag-of-words
and better Precision. To improve the results, we
have extended this basic representation with the
lexical items in the corresponding glosses of Ba-
belNet (+BABEL) (only for nouns) and the lexical
items of the MWN Italian glosses (+IT) (for verbs
and nouns)7. The results are illustrated in Table 2.
In both cases, the extension of the basic sense
representations with additional data is positive,
namely for Recall. Notice that for verbs the pres-
ence of Italian MWN glosses improves the align-
ment results (for the no-threshold filter, F1=0.37
vs. F=0.35 for SREL and F1=0.34 for SYN) as
they introduce information which better represents
the sense definition than the synset words in the
bag of words representations and overcomes miss-
ing information in the WN 3.0 annotated glosses.
For instance, consider the following example for
the verb “rendere” [to make]. In example 1a) the
two senses are aligned with a very low lexical
overlap score as there is only one word in com-

The positive effect of the original Italian data
for verbs points out a further issue for our task,
namely that the derivation of sense representations
of MWN synsets by means of synset words (in-
cluding the sense annotated glosses of WN 3.0)
is not as powerful as having at disposal original
glosses.
Similarly, for nouns we register an improve-
ment in Recall at a low or null cost for Pre-
cision for all filtering methods, with the exclu-
sion of the no threshold filtering. Precision for
SYN+BABEL+IT with maximum score filtering
is lowered with respect to the extension with the
BabelNet data only (P=0.66 for SYN+BABEL+IT
vs. P=0.69 for SYN+BABEL)8. To better clarify
these results, consider the following example for
the noun “palla” [ball]. In the example 2a) the

Concerning the filtering of the proposed align-
ments, the maximum score filter provides the best
results for Precision at a low cost in terms of
Recall, with F1 scores for verbs ranging from
0.34 (SYN+IT) to 0.29 (SYN), and from 0.55
(SYN+BABEL) to 0.52 (SYN and SREL) for
nouns. It is interesting to point out a further dif-
ference in performance between verbs and nouns.
In particular, for verbs we can observe that the
filtering based on maximum score has lower F1
values with respect to the no threshold baseline
in all sense descriptions. As for nouns, on the
contrary, both the two basic sense descriptions,
SYN and SREL, and the SYN+BABEL configu-
ration have comparable F1 values between the no
threshold and the maximum score data. Never-
theless, the filtering based on the maximum score
improves the quality of the proposed alignment
by removing lots of false positives both for verbs
and nouns (for verbs P=0.59 for SYN, P=0.60
for SREL, and P=0.63 for SYN+IT; for nouns,
P=0.69 for SYN, SREL, and SYN+BABEL,
P=0.66 for SYN+BABEL+IT) without impacting
on the number of good instances retrieved (for
verbs R=0.19 for SYN, R=0.20 for SREL, and
R=0.23 for SYN+IT; for nouns R=0.42 for SYN
and SREL, R=0.44 for SYN+BABEL; R=0.45 for
SYN+BABEL+IT).

Similarly to the Lexical Match, the Personal-
ized Page Rank approach outperforms the baseline
rand. Overall, the differences in performance
with the Lexical Match results are not immediate.
In general, as the Recall values for no threshold
filtering show, almost all aligned sense pairs of
the gold are retrieved, outperforming the Lexical
Match. Clearly, this difference is strictly related to
the different nature of the sense descriptions, i.e. a
semantic representation based on a lexical knowl-
edge graph, which is able to catch semantically re-
lated items out of the scope for the Lexical Match
approach.
By observing the figures for verbs, we notice
that the simple cut-off thresholds provide better
results with respect to the maximum score. The
best F1 score (F1=0.32) is obtained when setting
the cosine similarity to 0.1, though Precision is
less than 0.50 (namely, 0.47). When compared
with threshold value of 0.1 of the Lexical Match,
the Personalized Page Rank method yields the
best Precision (P=0.47 vs. P=0.42 for Verb SYN,
P=0.38 for Verb SYN+IT, and P=0.40 for Verb
SREL). Similar observations can be done when the
threshold is set to 0.2. In this latter case, Person-
alized Page Rank yields the best Precision score
for verbs with respect to all other filtering methods
and the Lexical Match results obtained with max-
imum score (P=0.66 vs. P=0.59 for Verb SYN,
P=0.63 for Verb SYN+IT, and P=0.60 for Verb
SREL).
The analysis for nouns is more complex. Ap-
parently, the Personalized Page Rank approach
has lower F1 scores with respect to all Lexical
Match sense configurations and filtering meth-
ods, including the no threshold score of the ba-
sic sense descriptions (respectively, F1=0.55 for
SYN, F1=0.54 for SREL, F1=0.21 for Personal-
ized Page Rank). However, when maximizing Pre-
cision for the Personalized Page Rank (threshold
0.2), the algorithm provides better performances
(F1=0.33) with respect to Lexical Match on the
same filtering method, minimizing the drop of Re-
call (R=0.21; +0.09 with respect to SYN+BABEL
with same threshold; + 0.08 with respect to SREL;
+0.05 with respect to SYN, respectively).
The better performance of the simple cut-off
thresholds with respect to the maximum score is
due to the fact that aligning senses by means of
semantic similarity provides a larger set of align-
ments and facilitates the identification of multiple
alignments, i.e. one-to-many.

As the two approaches are different in nature both
with respect to the creation of the sense descrip-

together the results obtained from the best sense

The combination of the best results yields the

for verbs we obtain an F1=0.47, with an improve-

21 points with respect to Personalized Page Rank

observed for nouns, where SYN+BABEL+ppr02

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981941176471">
This paper focuses on the automatic alignment
of senses from two different resources when few
data are available. In particular, the lack of Ital-
ian glosses in MWN and the absence of any kind
of structured information in the SCDM dictionary
posed a serious issue for the application of state-
of-the-art techniques for sense alignment.
We experimented with two different ap-
proaches: Lexical Match and Sense Similarity ob-
tained from Personalized Page Rank. In all cases,
when filtering the data we are facing low scores
for Recall which point out issues namely related
to data sparseness in our lexica. By comparing the
results of the two approaches, we can observe that:
i.) the Personalized Page Rank yields the best Pre-
cision with respect to Lexical Match; ii.) Lexical
Match, with a simple sense description configu-
ration (i.e. the SYN configurations for verbs and
nouns), is still a powerful approach for this kind of
tasks; the exploitation of additional semantically
related items (e.g. SREL for verbs) or additional
sense descriptors (e.g. SYN+BABEL for nouns),
though good in principle, has a limited contribu-
tion to solve the “lexical gap” problem in our case
and points out differences in the way word senses
are encoded in the two lexica; and iii.) Personal-
ized Page Rank vectors and Lexical Match appears
to qualify as complementary methods for achiev-
ing reliable sense alignments, namely when deal-
ing with few data. Our approach provides satis-
fying results both for verb and noun sense align-
ment, with an overall F1=0.47 for verbs and an
F1=0.64 for nouns. The better results for nouns
are strictly related to the definitions of the senses
which mainly relies on synonym words and hy-
pernyms. On the other hand, verbs tend to have
more abstract definitions and the contribution of
additional semantic relations (i.e. the SREL con-
figuration) is poor.
Future work will concentrate on two aspects
by exploiting the sense alignment results. The
aligned sense pairs will be used for sense cluster-
ing as a strategy to reduce the sense descriptions
in MWN and in SCDM. Existing clustering of WN
senses (e.g. Navigli (2006)) will be used as a start-
ing point and for subsequent evaluation. Further-
more, we aim at importing the ontological classes
of SCDM in MWN. This aspect will be useful for
the identification of possible taxonomical errors
in the MWN hierarchy and boostrap better sense
alignments.

The verb gold standard is composed by 44 lemmas selected according to corpus frequency (highly frequent lemmas in the La Repubblica Corpus (Baroni et al., 2004)) and patterns in terms of semantic and syntactic features6.

For SCDM, the linking of the entries with MWN plays a double role. On the one hand, it will introduce lexical-semantic relations, thus facilitating its use for NLP tasks in Italian, and, on the other hand, it will make SCDM a structurally and semantically interoperable resource for Italian, to which other lexical-semantic resources (both in Italian, such as PAROLE-SIMPLE-CLIPS (Ruimy et al., 2003), and in English, such as VerbNet (Kipper Schuler, 2005), among others), sense annotated corpora (e.g. the MultiSemCor corpus (Bentivogli and Pianta, 2005)), and Web-based encyclopedia (e.g. Wikipedia) can be connected. At this stage of development we focused on the alignment of verbs and nouns. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will state the task and describe the characteristics of the two lexica. In Section 3 some related works and the perculiarities of our work are discussed.

As for our task, the most similar work is (Navigli, 2006) where entries from a lexicographic dictionary, namely the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), are mapped to WN. The author adopts and compares two methods: a.) a pure lexical matching function based on the notion of lexical overlap (Lesk, 1986) of the lemmas in the sense descriptions; and b.) a semantic matching based on a knowledge-based WSD system, Structural Semantic Interconnections (SSI), built upon WN and enriched with collocation information representing semantic relatedness between sense pairs. In this latter approach, first each sense description in WN and in the OED is disambiguated by means of SSI with respect to the WN sense inventory, thus obtaining a semantic description as a bag of concepts. Then, two senses are matched if a relation edge is identified between the concepts in the description of each sense in the two l</context>

As for nouns we have 4,586 senses, corresponding to 1,111 lemmas with an average polysemy of 4.12 senses per lemma. In SCDM, word senses are encoded following lexicographic principles and are associated with lexicographic examples of usage. Senso Comune comprises three modules: i.) a top level module for basic ontological concepts; ii.) a lexical module for linguistic and lexicographic structures; and iii.) a frame module for modeling the predicative structure of verbs and nouns. The top level ontology is inspired by DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) (Masolo et al., 2002). All nominal entries have been manually classified according to the ontological concepts and an ontological classification of verb entries will start in the near future. With respect to MWN, word senses are not hierarchically structured and no semantic relation is encoded.

The results obtained from the merging of the two approaches are satisfying, with F1 values of 0.47 for verbs and 0.64 for nouns. 1 Introduction This work is situated in the field of word sense alignment, a research area which has seen an increasing interest in recent years and which is a key requirement for achieving semantic interoperability between different lexical-semantic resources (Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013). Our goal is to automatically import high-quality glosses in Italian in MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002) (MWN) by aligning its synsets to the entries of a lexicographic dictionary, namely the Senso Comune De Mauro (SCDM), thus providing Italian with a more complete and robust version of MWN. For SCDM, the linking of the entries with MWN plays a double role. On the one hand, it will introduce lexical-semantic relations, thus facilitating its use for NLP tasks in Italian, and, on the other hand, it will make SCDM a structurally and semantically interoperable resource for Italian, to which other lexical-semantic resources (both in Italian, such as PAROLE-SIMPLE-CLIPS (Ruimy et al., 2003), and in En</context>

While different methods are employed (similaritybased approaches vs. graph-based approaches), common elements of these works are: i.) the extensive use of lexical knowledge based on the sense descriptions such as the WN glosses or an article first paragraph as in the case of Wikipedia; and ii.) the extension of </context>

For SCDM, the linking of the entries with MWN plays a double role. On the one hand, it will introduce lexical-semantic relations, thus facilitating its use for NLP tasks in Italian, and, on the other hand, it will make SCDM a structurally and semantically interoperable resource for Italian, to which other lexical-semantic resources (both in Italian, such as PAROLE-SIMPLE-CLIPS (Ruimy et al., 2003), and in English, such as VerbNet (Kipper Schuler, 2005), among others), sense annotated corpora (e.g. the MultiSemCor corpus (Bentivogli and Pianta, 2005)), and Web-based encyclopedia (e.g. Wikipedia) can be connected. At this stage of development we focused on the alignment of verbs and nouns. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will state the task and describe the characteristics of the two lexica. In Section 3 some related works and the perculiarities of our work are discussed. The approaches we have adopted are described in Section 4. The evaluation is carried o</context>

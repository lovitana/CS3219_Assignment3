<bodyText confidence="0.999703">
A comparison and alignment of lexical re-
sources brings about considerable mutual ben-
efits for all resources involved. For all sense
distinctions that are completely parallel in two
resources, such an alignment provides support-
ing external evidence for the validity of sense
distinction and allows enriching word senses
by information contained in the other resource.
By contrast, for all non-matching sense dis-
tinctions, reason for revisiting and possibly re-
vising the lexical entries in question is provid-
ed. The purpose of this paper is to compare the
German wordnet GermaNet with the Digital
Dictionary of the German Language (DWDS)
and to align word senses in the two resources.
The paper presents issues that arise in practice
when such an alignment is performed and in-
dicates the benefits that both resources will
gain.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996780098360656">
It has long been recognized that the identification
and differentiation of word senses is one of the
harder tasks that lexicographers face. As a result,
lexical resources display considerable variation
in the number of word senses that lexicographers
assign to a given lexical entry in a dictionary.
Against this background, lexicographic practice
has undertaken considerable efforts to find exter-
nal knowledge sources that can aid in distin-
guishing and identifying word senses. The exter-
nal knowledge sources that are most widely used
for this purpose are very large electronic corpora
that can be harvested for a given word under lex-
icographic consideration. Another type of re-
source that has also been explored as an external
reference point is the comparison with another
semantic dictionary that has been constructed
independently for the same language.
The present paper reports on an ongoing pro-
ject in which the German wordnet GermaNet
(Hamp and Feldweg, 1997; Henrich and Hin-
richs, 2010) is compared to the word senses con-
tained in the Digital Dictionary of the German
Language (Digitales Wšrterbuch der Deutschen
Sprache1, DWDS; Klein and Geyken, 2010).
Both resources are long-term lexicographic pro-
jects aiming at a comprehensive coverage of con-
temporary standard German in electronic form.
What makes a comparison between these re-
sources particularly interesting and useful is the
fact that they utilize two different methods for
constructing word meanings.
The DWDS is based on the digital versions of
three pre-existing dictionaries: the Dictionary of
Contemporary German (Wšrterbuch der deut-
schen Gegenwartssprache, WDG), the Grimm
Dictionaries Deutsches Wšrterbuch von Jacob
Grimm und Wilhelm Grimm (1DWB) and its re-
vised version (2DWB), as well as the Etymologi-
cal German Dictionary by Wolfgang Pfeifer (Et-
ymWb). The lexical entries inherited from these
dictionaries have been revised and amended by
information harvested from large electronic cor-
pora of contemporary German (Didakowski et
al., 2012). DWDS lexical entries are structured
by the number of senses which may be further
differentiated by an enumeration of subsenses.
Senses are accompanied by examples harvested
from German text corpora or by so-called com-
petence examples that are manually constructed.
The conception of word meaning underlying
GermaNet adheres to the idea of a network of
meaningfully related words and concepts that are
interlinked by a set of lexical and conceptual re-
lations and that was first realized in the Princeton
WordNet for English (Fellbaum, 1998). The set
of lexical and conceptual relations include syn-
onymy, hypernymy/hyponymy, meronymy/holo-
nymy, causation, antonymy, and pertainymy.
The comparison of GermaNet and the DWDS
dictionary will focus on the alignment of Germa-

Net senses (synsets and lexical units) with the
senses and subsenses of DWDS lexical entries.
The benefits of this GermaNet-DWDS compari-
son include the following:

<listItem confidence="0.823525263157895">
• If the set of sense distinctions match for a
given word lemma in both resources, then
this provides supporting external evidence
for the validity of these sense distinctions.
• If the set of sense distinctions differ between
the two resources, then this provides reason
for revisiting and possibly revising the lexi-
cal entries in question.
Apart from the comparison of word senses,
each resource stands to gain from the GermaNet-
DWDS mapping in the following ways:
• It becomes possible to implement an intelli-
gent semantic search for the DWDS that
provides users not just with the word senses
of a given lexical entry but also with lexical
information about related words.
• GermaNet synsets and lexical units can be
enriched by suitable definitions as well as
examples contained in the DWDS.

The purpose of this paper is to present the re-

issues that arise in practice when such a mapping
is performed.
2 Survey of the Overlapping Coverage
The total number of lemmas that have lexical
entries in both resources is 48,0362 (6,211 adjec-
tives, 34,366 nouns, and 7,735 verbs), which co-
vers about 53.5% of all lemmas encoded in Ger-
maNet. At first glance, this overlap might seem
low. However, on a closer look, there is an ex-
planation for this which mainly concerns the fol-
lowing three points:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99668925">
• The history of the two resources causes dif-
ferences in coverage. The DWDS is based on
the digital versions of three pre-existing dic-
tionaries that do not include most recent con-
temporary language. By contrast, the terms
to be included in GermaNet follow frequen-
cy lists extracted from large corpora such as
newspaper texts and Wikipedia, which also
contain recent contemporary language.
• Both resources have different basic decisions
on what terms and senses should be includ-
ed. The perspectives and guidelines that the

8.0 as of April 2013 and on the DWDS subset taken from
version 0.4.17 and filtered for all lexical entries for lemmas
covered by both resources. This filtered subset has been
made available to us on August 9, 2013.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.962690444444444">
lexicographers of both resources pursue dif-
fer. For example, the resources deviate in the
inclusion of regional, obsolete, technical, and
colloquial terms as well as most recent con-
temporary language. This further explains
why the coverage of GermaNet and the
DWDS differs.
• Since compounding is a highly productive
phenomenon of the German language, the
question of which compounds to include in a
lexical resource is not trivial to answer.
There are many newly created compounds
that eventually – after some undefined time
and depending on the frequency of general
usage – might become part of the fundamen-
tal vocabulary of the German language.
Thus, especially for the coverage of com-
pounds, there is a huge deviation between
the two resources.
Since senses in the DWDS might be further
differentiated by an enumeration of subsenses, a
survey on word senses involves more than one
comparison. GermaNet distinguishes 59,495
senses for the 48,036 lemmas that the two re-
sources share. The overall number of 61,053
main sense distinctions in the DWDS is very
similar. On the contrary, the number of main
senses plus subsenses on the highest level encod-
ed in the DWDS is 74,346, which is more than in
GermaNet. This suggests a mapping on the main
sense level of the DWDS.
The outcome of this survey proves that there is
a considerable overlap of word lemmas with a
comparable amount of senses in both resources,
which supports the usefulness of conducting a
sense alignment.

3 Evaluation of the Sense Alignment
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99975425">
In order to be able to evaluate the alignment
on the level of senses and subsenses, the lexical
entries for an initial set of 470 randomly selected
word lemmas (see Section 4 for the selection
process) have been manually analyzed with re-
gard to the appropriateness of matching senses
from one resource onto the senses in the other
resource. The variability of how good the senses
can be matched leads to a division into four clas-
ses that are illustrated and described in the fol-
lowing four subsections – in descending order
according to their alignment appropriateness.

3.1 Class 1: Exact match of main senses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999886">
Class 1 represents the ideal case, i.e., senses in
GermaNet correspond to main senses in the
DWDS. The German noun Pferd is a case in
point. As illustrated in Figure 1, this lemma has
the three distinct senses in both resources repre-
senting an animal horse, a gymnastic horse, and a
chess knight. All word senses that fall into this
class show an identical overlapping lexical cov-
erage and an identical granularity level of sense
distinctions. For both GermaNet and the DWDS,
this provides mutual supporting evidence for the
validity of these sense distinctions.
For GermaNet, the obvious gain for all these
senses is an enrichment by suitable definitions
and examples contained in the corresponding
DWDS senses. For the DWDS, it becomes pos-
sible for all these senses that an intelligent se-
mantic search provides users not just with the
word senses of a given lexical entry but also with
lexical information about related words.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999496">
3.2 Class 2: Exact match of subsenses
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991205882353">
There are several senses in GermaNet that do not
correspond to main senses in the DWDS but
which correspond to subsenses in the DWDS.
These latter ones are included in class 2. Figure 2
gives an example using the word Bogen. In Ger-
maNet, there are two distinct senses representing
a violin bow and a bow as a weapon (see the left
side of Figure 2). In the DWDS, there is a main
sense described as gebogenes GerŠt ‘curved de-
vice’ which is further differentiated into the two
subsenses of a violin bow (sub 1) and a bow as a
weapon (sub 2) – see the two entries denoted by
sub 1 and sub 2 on the right side of Figure 2.
The overall coverage for these senses is the
same. It is only the granularity level of the sense
distinctions that differs. The reason for this dif-
ference results from different perspectives and
guidelines of how to model word senses that the
lexicographers of both resources pursue. There is
an agreement between lexicographers of both
resources that the two senses under consideration
should be modeled separately. The question of
whether to constitute two separate word senses
or two subsenses of a common main sense is
bound to the nature of the resources, i.e., Germa-
Net does not further distinguish word senses into
subsenses.
The senses that fall into this class again pro-
vide support for the validity of the sense distinc-
tions for both resources. Furthermore, the en-
richment of GermaNet senses with definitions
and examples as well as the enrichment of
DWDS senses with information on related words
is equally possible than it is described for class 1.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.8680505">
3.3 Class 3: Partly overlapping coverage
and different sense distinctions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938882352941">
Class 3 contains senses for which a straightfor-
ward one-to-one mapping is not possible. This
includes the following two cases: (i) two separate
senses from one resource are jointly represented
by only one sense in the other resource and (ii)
the core meaning of two senses is the same, but
the two senses are still not completely identical
in their coverage.
The German noun Pranke is a case in point for
case (i). The DWDS encodes a sense defined as
Vordertatze, besonders von groj3en Raubtieren;
umgangssprachlich, scherzhaft, übertragen:
groj3e, starke Hand ’forepaw of an animal, espe-
cially a predator; colloquial, jokingly, figurative:
big, strong hand’ (see the right side in Figure 3).
In GermaNet, Pranke has the two fine-grained
senses denoting the paw of an animal and the
</bodyText>

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989254901961">
figurative term for the human hand (see the left
side in Figure 3). In this example, both these
more specific GermaNet senses are subsumed
under one single DWDS sense.
In the second case (ii) that is subsumed by
class 3, there is no complete coverage of the
meaning of one sense in one resource with the
corresponding sense in the other resource. The
core sense is mostly identical, but there are
meaning aspects that led the lexicographers to
decide differently on whether to explicitly en-
code a separate sense in the dictionary or not.
An example of this type is the German noun
Sturm ‘storm’. Both GermaNet and the DWDS
encode a sense referring to the weather phenom-
enon. Accompanying example sentences of this
word sense in the DWDS include instances ex-
emplifying a figurative usage, such as, for exam-
ple, ein Sturm der EntrŸstung ‘a storm of indig-
nation’. That means, the figurative meaning of
Sturm is explicitly mentioned in the DWDS
weather phenomenon sense – without encoding a
separate sense or subsense. By contrast, the fig-
urative meaning of Sturm is not present in Ger-
maNet – neither as part of the corresponding
weather phenomenon sense nor explicitly as a
separate sense.
The phenomena of both cases (i) and (ii) can-
not solely be explained by the lexicographic
background of the two resources. They rather
illustrate different lexicographic perspectives of
how to distinguish senses of a word. The ques-
tion at what point a meaning should be regarded
as a distinct sense or subsense to be included in a
dictionary is a difficult issue in lexicographic
work. Aspects that affect this decision include
figurative meaning, technical, colloquial, or re-
gional usage of a term. Both in the paw and in
the storm examples, the lexicographers of the
two resources have made different decisions with
respect to the status of the figurative meaning of
a word sense.
As for the benefit from a mapping of senses in
this class, it would mean that each example sen-
tence for the DWDS senses in question has to be
analyzed individually in order to decide whether
it can be assigned to a GermaNet sense. None-
theless, it is interesting to further analyze these
cases since they concern the identification and
differentiation of word senses which is one of the
harder tasks that lexicographers face.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.96887">
3.4 Class 4: Distinct coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988260869565">
This class comprises lemmas where there is at
least one sense or subsense in one resource that
does not have a corresponding entry in the other
resource. An example of this kind is illustrated in
Figure 4 using the example of Maus. For this
word, GermaNet encodes the two senses of the
mouse as an animal and the computer mouse (see
the left side of Figure 4). The DWDS also en-
codes the animal sense of a mouse, but it does
not include the computer mouse sense. Instead,
the DWDS lists MŠuse (plural for Maus) in the
sense of an informal synonym for money (see the
right side of Figure 4).
As illustrated in the mouse example, both re-
sources gain benefit from a sense alignment by
mutually providing suggestions of possibly miss-
ing senses. In general, with the help of simple
word comparisons, it is easy to automatically
compile lists of lemmas that serve as candidates
to be inserted into a dictionary. By contrast, it is
much more difficult to provide (automatic) sug-
gestions of possibly missing senses. In all cases
where the sense alignment discovers different

4 Evaluation Statistics
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995027333333333">
The selection of the initial set of manually
aligned word lemmas is guided by the following
criteria:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990580076923077">
• The selected words include all three word
classes of adjectives, nouns, and verbs.
• In order to ensure a detailed evaluation of
lexical items with different degrees of poly-
semy, the evaluation reports results for five
different polysemy classes: words having (i)
one sense in GermaNet, (ii) two senses in
GermaNet, (iii) three or four senses, (iv) five
to ten senses, and (v) more than ten senses in
GermaNet.
• The sample as a whole represents a good
balance of word classes and number of dis-
tinct word senses.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.914964058823529">
That is, for adjectives and verbs, 35 lemmas
were randomly selected for each of the polysemy
classes (i) to (v). Since the coverage for nouns is
higher compared to the coverage of the other two
word classes, 50 nominal lemmas were randomly
chosen for each polysemy class. Table 1 shows
the total number of word lemmas and corre-
sponding word senses (in parentheses) in each
polysemy class for the three word classes3 that
were manually aligned by two experienced lexi-
cographers. Column All POS contains the
summed numbers for all word classes (i.e., part-
of-speech, POS) separately for the polysemy
classes.

senses as well as about the word category of the lemmas is
taken from GermaNet.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999181875">
Note that the number of lemmas for adjectives
with three or four senses and for nouns and verbs
with more than ten senses is lower than men-
tioned above. The reason is simply because there
are only few lemmas encoded both in GermaNet
and the DWDS that fall into these classes, i.e., 8,
3, and 14, respectively. Adjectives with more
than ten senses do not exist at all.
Altogether, 470 distinct word lemmas were
manually checked by the lexicographers. These
lemmas correspond to 1,517 senses (in Germa-
Net) of which 113 adjectives, 203 nouns, and
154 verbs. That is, the 470 words have an aver-
age of 3.2 senses (2.4 for adjectives, 3.1 for
nouns, and 4.0 for verbs). With the help of the
manual sense alignment, it is possible to classify
senses according to their alignment appropriate-
ness, i.e., into classes 1 to 4 described in Sec-
tions 3.1-3.4.
Table 2 lists the counts of these 1,517 Germa-
Net senses classified into the four alignment
classes separately for the previously defined pol-

words with respect to their number of different
senses. The rows show the different alignment
classes 1 – 4 separately for each of the three
word categories of adjectives, nouns, and verbs.

each word class per polysemy class. Rows

The numbers in Table 2 count senses rather
than lemmas. Note that this implies that senses of
a single lemma do not necessarily all have to be
classified to the same alignment class but can
belong to different classes – what arises quite
frequently in practice. An example of this kind is
the lemma Maus which has already been dis-
cussed in Section 3.4 (see Figure 4). The first
GermaNet sense depicting the mouse as an ani-
mal has a corresponding main sense on the
DWDS side; meaning that this sense is counted
for alignment class 1. On the contrary, the se-
cond GermaNet sense for this lemma, which rep-
resents the computer mouse sense, does not have
a corresponding match on the DWDS side. Thus,
the second sense has to be counted for class 4.

5 Discussion of the Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960591549296">
To begin with the most prominent and important
result, classes 1 (exact match of main senses) and
2 (exact match of subsenses) together arise in
61% of all cases, i.e., 47% and 14%, respectively
– see Table 2. This suggests that for three out of
five word senses from GermaNet there is a
matching sense in the DWDS with which a Ger-
maNet sense can be aligned. This underscores
the overall feasibility of a sense alignment be-
tween the two lexical resources. The obvious
gain for all these senses is the mutual enrichment
by sense-specific information – such as suitable
definitions, examples, and lexical relations – tak-
en from the matching sense.
Class 1 arises in 47% of all cases and thus
much more frequently than all other classes. The
fact that matches between GermaNet senses and
main senses in the DWDS (class 1) outnumber
matches between GermaNet senses and subsens-
es in the DWDS (class 2) was to be expected.
This confirms the conception of word senses on
the same granularity level in both resources.
Both classes 3 (partly overlapping coverage
and different sense distinctions) and 4 (distinct
coverage) reveal differences between GermaNet
and the DWDS that prevent a straight forward
sense alignment. The explanation why class 3
arises in 31% of all cases, i.e., why there are dif-
ferences in the distinction of senses, is due to the
lexicographic background of the two resources.
The lexicographers of GermaNet and the DWDS
pursue different perspectives and guidelines of
how to model word senses, e.g. with respect to
the sense granularity. Thus, from a lexicogra-
pher’s perspective, it is interesting to analyze
these cases since they concern the identification
and differentiation of word senses which is one
of the harder tasks that lexicographers face. To
gain benefit from a mapping of senses in this
class, it would mean that all information for a
sense has to be analyzed in order to be individu-
ally assigned to a corresponding sense.
Class 4, which indicates a distinct coverage of
GermaNet and the DWDS, shows fewest occur-
rences. In only 9% of all GermaNet senses, there
is no corresponding entry in the DWDS. It
should be kept in mind that this number only ap-
plies to those 48,036 lemmas that are encoded in
both resources. For all remaining lemmas, there
are no lexical entries in the DWDS at all and thus
these word senses would fall into class 4 as well.
The evaluation for class 4 is biased towards one
direction, i.e., it regards GermaNet senses with
missing entries in the DWDS. Since it is also
interesting to analyze and compare the other way
around where there are DWDS senses lacking
matches in GermaNet, these cases have also been
recorded during the manual alignment. Altogeth-
er, there are 384 word senses (122 adjectival, 104
nominal, and 158 verbal senses) in the DWDS
that do not have a corresponding entry in Germa-
Net. In all cases where the sets of sense distinc-
tions differ between the two resources, this pro-
vides reason for revisiting and possibly revising
the lexical entries in question. Of course, this
also applies to all those word lemmas for which
there is a lexical entry in only one of the two re-
sources.
A comparison of the results for the three dif-
ferent word classes and polysemy classes yields
the following tendencies:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.950893875">
• Words with only one GermaNet sense almost
exclusively fall into class 1 – for all three
word classes. This is not surprising since
those words usually have one or few senses
in the DWDS and thus the probability that
the “same” most prominent sense of a word
is encoded in both resources is significant.
• More than half of all nouns (53%) fall into
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992135097560976">
class 1 – much fewer nouns (10%) fall into
class 2. By contrast, there are only 40% of all
verbs in class 1, but proportionally almost
twice as many verbs (18%) classified to
class 2 compared to nouns. This is especially
remarkable for verbs with more than four
senses. One reason for this difference is the
variety in the granularity level of the sense
distinctions in GermaNet and the DWDS
which arises more often for verbs than for
nouns.
• The deviation between the three word classes
for polysemous words, i.e., words with more
than one sense in GermaNet, is interesting to
observe. Adjectives and verbs show a pro-
portionally larger number of occurrences in
class 3 (34% and 36%, respectively) com-
pared to nouns (24%). This means that there
are more words with a partly overlapping
coverage and different sense distinctions for
adjectives and verbs than for nouns, e.g.,
where two senses from one resource jointly
describe one sense of the other resource.
• By contrast, this ratio is reversed for class 4,
where there are proportionally nearly twice
as many occurrences for nouns (13%) than
for adjectives and verbs (7% and 6%, respec-
tively). The explanation for this is that there
are more nominal senses that are not encoded
in one resource, but more adjectival and ver-
bal senses that encode an overlapping cover-
age with a different distinction of senses.
All in all, it is worthwhile to perform a com-
plete sense alignment between GermaNet and the
DWDS. This will open up a wide range of bene-
fits for both resources, including the harvesting
of sense-specific information and the external
support of sense distinctions for matching senses
as well as indicators for revisiting and possibly
revising the lexical entries in question for non-
matching senses.

There has been a considerable body of research
for English that investigates the alignment of the
Princeton WordNet with Wikipedia (including
Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; Ponzetto and Navigli,
2010; Niemann and Gurevych, 2011), with Wik-
tionary (including Meyer and Gurevych, 2011),
with the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary
English and with Roget&apos;s thesaurus (Kwong,
1998), with the Hector lexicon (Litkowski,
1999), or with the Oxford Dictionary of English
(Navigli, 2006).
Previous work for German has been on the
alignment of GermaNet with the German version
of Wiktionary (Henrich et al., 2011) and with the
German Wikipedia (Henrich et al., 2012).
However, there is no other previous research
that tries to align GermaNet to the DWDS.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976603125">
This initial pilot study has proven the feasibility
of a sense alignment between GermaNet and the
DWDS both in term of quantity and appropriate-
ness. We have learned about the differences in
the distinction of senses that are due to different
perspectives and guidelines of how to model
word senses that the lexicographers of both re-
sources pursue. The classification of senses ac-
cording to their appropriateness to be aligned
with senses from the other resource allows an
individual treatment of different issues and phe-
nomena that arise in practice when an alignment
of two resources is performed.
The alignment of GermaNet with the DWDS
brings about considerable mutual benefits for
both resources. For all sense distinctions that are
completely parallel in the two resources, the
alignment provides supporting external evidence
for the validity of sense distinction and allows
enriching word senses by information contained
in the other resource. By contrast, for all non-
matching sense distinctions, reason for revisiting
and possibly revising the lexical entries in ques-
tion is provided.
The natural next step, which we have already
started to work on, is to implement an algorithm
that automatically aligns senses from the two
resources. This provides a good basis for the lex-
icographer’s work of post-correcting the auto-
matic alignment and revising the senses in both
resources, which still remains a complex and
substantial task to be performed.

The lexical entries inherited from these dictionaries have been revised and amended by information harvested from large electronic corpora of contemporary German (Didakowski et al., 2012). DWDS lexical entries are structured by the number of senses which may be further differentiated by an enumeration of subsenses. Senses are accompanied by examples harvested from German text corpora or by so-called competence examples that are manually constructed.

This will open up a wide range of benefits for both resources, including the harvesting of sense-specific information and the external support of sense distinctions for matching senses as well as indicators for revisiting and possibly revising the lexical entries in question for nonmatching senses. 6 Related Work There has been a considerable body of research for English that investigates the alignment of the Princeton WordNet with Wikipedia (including Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; Ponzetto and Navigli, 2010; Niemann and Gurevych, 2011), with Wiktionary (including Meyer and Gurevych, 2011), with the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and with Roget&apos;s thesaurus (Kwong, 1998), with the Hector lexicon (Litkowski, 1999), or with the Oxford Dictionary of English (Navigli, 2006). Previous work for German has been on the alignment of GermaNet with the German version of Wiktionary (Henrich et al., 2011) and with the German Wikipedia (Henrich et al., 2012).

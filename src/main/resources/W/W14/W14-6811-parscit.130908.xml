Annotating linguistic data is often a
complex, time consuming and expensive
endeavor. Even with strict annotation
guidelines, human subjects often deviate
in their analyses, each bring different bi-
ases, interpretations of the task and levels
of consistency. The aim of this paper is to
explore a way to find out the inconsisten-
cies in the corpus TreeBank which is
used for syntactic analysis through the
procedure we study the inconsistencies of
verb phrase tagging in the corpus Tree-
Bank. At the same time, we can analyze
the inconsistencies of verb phrase tagging
which are found in the corpus TreeBank
in order that we can find a way to im-
prove the consistency of verb phrase tag-
ging automatically which is effective to
improve the quality of corpus.

<bodyText confidence="0.999878291666667">
Most empirical work in Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) is based on supervised machine
learning techniques which rely on human anno-
tated data of some form or another. But the con-
struction of a corpus is a complicated work. Es-
pecially for individuals, it’s a more hard assign-
ment. Generally, a large-scale and high quality
corpus comes from a team and it requires work-
ing in teams and different people is responsible
for a particular part of the corpus respectively.
Due to that the work is cut into several parts and
distributed to different persons, inconsistencies
may be generated. Because everyone has an in-
dividual understanding about the same case and
different people may make the different annota-
tions. All of these may cause inconsistencies, and
even errors. When we train our models with a
corpus which may contains inconsistencies even
errors, the models will not represent the real dis-
tribution of the problems precisely. So the work
to find the inconsistencies in the corpus and to
correct them is useful to improve the precision of
the models, which can help us obtain more accu-
rate results in natural language processing.

At present, the research on corpus consistency is
mainly concentrated on the consistency of word
segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.
Liu Bo, Zheng Jiaheng and Zhang Hu proposed a
method to handle the consistency of word seg-
mentation which is based on the combination of
statistics and rules. They also introduced a num-
ber of strategies to handle different kinds of in-
consistency [5]. Zhang Hu and Zheng Jiaheng
put forward a method to check the consistency of
part-of-speech (POS) tagging on the foundation
of the analysis of the part-of-speech (POS) tag-
ging which is based on the classifications of am-
biguity words [11].
Besides the research on the inconsistency of
word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS)
tagging, some people focused on the research
about the ambiguity of structure or function in
Chinese corpus gradually as well. The Chinese
ambiguities of structure in high frequency are
divided into three basic types based on the analy-
sis of structural ambiguity. By analyzing the am-
biguities of structure, Yang Sichun and Chen
Jiajun found out the causes of structural ambigui-

especially the solution based on examples [12].
This paper aims to find the inconsistencies of
verb phrase tagging in the corpus TreeBank. As
we all know, some errors always exists in corpus
as a kind of inconsistency. So when we find out
the inconsistencies in the corpus TreeBank we
will lay a foundation of finding out errors in the

In this paper, we use the corpus which is
named Chinese Treebank 7.0 (CTB7.0). There
are 2,448 text files in this release, containing
51,447 sentences, 1,196,329words, 1,931,381
hanzi (Chinese characters). The data is provided
in four different formats: raw text, word seg-
mented, word segmented and POS-tagged, and
syntactically bracketed formats.
In Chinese Treebank 7.0 (CTB7.0), the fre-
quency of verb phrases is in second dgree, which
is only less than the frequency of noun phrase. In
addition, the usage of Chinese vocabulary is
very flexible and a word always can act as a va-
riety of components of the grammar in different
context, especially verb, which causes a lot of
grammatical ambiguity in syntactic analysis. So,
we choose the verb phrases to find out
the inconsistent tagging.

Although compounding is highly productive in
Chinese, it is still considered to be a lexical pro-
cess. Therefore compounds are treated in a simi-
lar fashion as simple monolithic verbs. The chal-
lenge is to clearly identify compounds and dis-
tinguish them from situations where a phrasal
projection is necessary. Due to the lack of a clear
standard between compounds and phrases in
Chinese, we will adopt the following working
criteria for verb compounds where there is a se-
quence of verbs: (1) they share the argument
structure, (2) they share aspect markers, (3) they
share modifiers, (4) and they do not fall into the
clearly defined raising or control structures.

4.1 The Method Based on Comparison of
Tags of Verb Phrases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.92264446">
We divided all of the verb phrases into different
categories based on the Chinese characters which
were consisted of the verb phrase. Then we com-
pared the annotations of verb phrases which be-
longed to the same category each other. If we
found the different tagging of verb phrases in one
category, there might be inconsistency in it.
Procedure.
Our goal is to find out the verb phrases in cor-
pus that they shared the same Chinese characters
while their tagging are different.
Step1: Finding verb phrases.
Firstly, we found all of the verb phrases in
corpus and divided them into different categories
based on the Chinese characters which were con-
sisted of them. At the same time we recorded
their provenance which contained the index of
the text and the sentence. An example is shown
as follows.
eg1: 一百亿 元 人民币
TAGS:(VP(VP(NP-
PRD(QP(CD)(CLP(M)))(NP(NN)))))
TAGS: (VP (NP-
PRD(QP(CD)(CLP(M)))(NP(NN))))
TAGS: (VP(VP(NP-
PRD(QP(CD)(CLP(M)))(NP(NN)))))
TAGS: (VP(NP-
PRD(QP(CD)(CLP(M)))(NP(NN))))
Step2: Finding verb phrases that appear more
than once.
Secondly, after dividing all of the verb phrases
into different categories, we kept the categories
that contain more than one verb phrases and re-
moved the categories that contain only one verb
phrase.
eg2: “ 公开 、 公平 、 公正 ”
TAGS:
(VP(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU))
TAGS:
(VP(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU))
TAGS:
(VP(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU))
TAGS:
(VP(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU)(VA)(PU))
Step3: Finding categories appearing different.
Thirdly, after dividing all the verb phrases into
different categories based on the Chinese charac-
ters which were consisted of them, we found out
the categories in which there were different tag-
ging of verb phrases.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.717942777777778">

TAGS: (VP(PP(-NONE-*T*-
1))(VP(PU)(VV)(PU)))
TAGS: (VP(PU)(VV)(PU))
TAGS: (VP(PP(-NONE-*T*-
1))(VP(PU)(VV)(PU)))
TAGS: (VP(PU)(VV)(PU))
Step4: Eliminating the Influence of Omit-
ted Structure.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993357125">
Fourthly, we eliminated the influence of omit-
ted structure. In the results of step 3, we found
some differences were only caused by the omit-
ted structure. Omitted structure was related to
parsing, and we didn’t take care of this temporar-
ily. So we eliminated the categories in which the
differences were only caused by omit-
ted structure.

TAGS: (VP(PP(-NONE-*T*-

TAGS: (VP(PU)(VV)(PU))
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998825">
In the example above, the difference are only
caused by omitted structure. So we should elimi-
nate the category.
The operation of eliminating the influence of
omitted structure was on the result of step 3.
Firstly, we arranged a device to store verb phrase
in a tree data structure. Secondly, we used these
devices to prune the omitted structure. Thirdly,
we restored the devices pruned to verb phrases.
Fourthly, repeated step 3. If after the operation,
the tags in a category are all the same, it means
that, the differences in this category caused only
by the omitted structure and it should be elimi-
nated.

4.2 Experimental Results and Analysis.
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972">
In this paper, we mainly research the first 612
texts in Chinese Treebank 7.0 (CTB7.0). We find
out a total of 37416 groups of verb phrases and
2430 groups contain more than one verb phrase.
In these 2430 groups of verb phrases there are
688 groups in which we find the inconsistency.
After eliminating the omitted structure there are
only 245 groups. And the 245 groups are the fi-
nally result. We find the 245 groups can be di-
vided into five categories.
The first kind of inconsistency of verb phrase
is that the verb phrase mark appears more than
once in a verb phrase. There is such a phenome-
non in the TreeBank corpus that in the outer lay-
er of a complete verb phrase a &amp;quot;VP&amp;quot; symbol was
marked repeatedly. We see this phenomenon as
the first kind of inconsistency.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996137">
72
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873876190477">
In the statistics about verb phrases, we took
“VP” as the signal of a verb phrase. Thus, if
there is a repetition of a verb phrase marked
symbol , we will find two verb phrases at least in
the result which satisfy the condition that they
share the same Chinese character while their
verb phrase tagging are different and the cause of
difference is only due to the additional “(VP)”.
According to the idea, we have found some cate-
gories in the results of classification of verb
phrases which satisfy the condition that in each
of these categories there are two different tag-
ging at least and one of them is the substring of
the other one and their difference is only due to
the additional “(VP)”.
The second kind of inconsistency is that the
type of verb compounds annotated inconsistently.
There is such a phenomenon in the Tree-
Bank corpus that the verb compounds share the
same tags of part of speech in different sentences
while the type of verb compounds annotation is
different. And this is the second kind of incon-
sistency.
There are six kinds of verb compounds, which
include VCD, VCP, VNV, VPT, VRD and VSB.
In a verb phrase, the relative position of verb
compounds is steady. Thus, the relative position
of tagging corresponding to the verb compounds
is steady as well. According to the fact, we have
created a table for each category of verb phrases
with the row standing for the index of the verb
phrase and the column standing for the relative
position of the verb compounds to storing the
entire symbol of verb compounds in it and com-
pared the values in column. We have found the
type of verb compounds annotated inconsistently
in some categories.
The third kind of inconsistency is that the tag-
ging of phrases are not complete. We can find
such a phenomenon in the TreeBank corpus that
some words share the same tags of part of speech
in different sentences and some of them are
marked the tags of phrase while some of them
are not. This is the third one.
In a category of verb phrases, if each verb
phrase is marked completely, the quantity of
symbol belonging to every phrase will be the
same. So, if a verb phrase isn’t marked complete-
ly, its quantity of symbols will less than others’.
According to the description, we have arranged a
device to store each verb phrase in a category in
a tree data structure. The number of nodes of a
tree is equal to the number of symbols of the cor-
responding verb phrase. We have found some
categories contain inconsistency due to the lack
of the tags of phrase by comparing the number of
nodes of every tree in the same category.
The fourth kind of inconsistency is similar to
the third one. It is also caused by not complete
annotation. But what is different is that the fourth
one is caused by the lack of functional tags. In
the TreeBank corpus some words share the same
tags of part of speech in different sentences and
some of them are marked the functional tags
while some of them are not.
In a category of verb phrases, all of the verb
phrases shared the same part-of-speech and each
verb phrase is marked completely, but the length
of catenation of symbols in each verb phrase is
different. It means that some verb phrase is lack
of functional tags.
The fifth kind of inconsistency is caused by
the different tagging of part of speech. In the
TreeBank corpus there are many conversion
words and their tagging of part of speech in dif-
ferent context are different. As a result, the verb
phrases which contain them will be marked with
different tags of phrase. So, we class the fifth one
as the category that is caused by the different
tagging of part of speech.
In a category of verb phrases, the inconsisten-
cy may result from the different part-of-speech
tagging. According to the fact, we have arranged
a device to store each verb phrase in a tree data
structure. In the tree data structure, the parent
node of leaf node is the part-of-speech tagging of
corresponding to the leaf node. So, we can get
the part-of-speech tagging of each Chinese char-
acter in a verb phrase from the tree data structure
easily. After getting the part-of-speech tagging,
we catenate all of them which are from the same
tree data structure as a string. We have found
some categories that contain inconsistency be-
cause of the different part-of-speech tagging by
comparing the strings that belong to the same
category.
In the 245 groups of verb phrases there are
224 groups can be classed as the members of
these five categories. It’s about 91.43% and these
five categories of inconsistency cover all kinds
of inconsistency nearly. There are 63 groups be-
long to the first category, 9 groups belong to the
second category, 26 groups belong to the third
category, 51 groups belong to the fourth category,
and 75 groups belong to the fifth category.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996812">
In this paper, we aim at find out the inconsisten-
cy in Chinese Treebank 7.0 (CTB7.0). Besides
the method described before, we also have tried
to solve this problem by to using other method
which is based on the assumption that if we clus-
ter the sentences in the corpus when we set the
annotations as the conditions of similarity meas-
urement, in the result, the small-scale clusters
may represent the wrong annotations. But the
result is not satisfied because of inappropriate
grain size. What’s more, what we have finished
is inadequate. For the first method, we just con-
sider the case that the verb phrases shared the
same Chinese characters which were consisted of
them while their tagging are different. We need
to consider other cases in future. For the Second
method, the grain sizes we have chosen is not
enough.
The next jobs is to try to consider other situa-
tion to find the inconsistency in Chinese Tree-
bank 7.0 (CTB7.0). For example, the verb phrase
shared the same tags of part of speech while their
tags are different. What’s more, we should
choose a proper grain size to remedy the method
based on statistic.

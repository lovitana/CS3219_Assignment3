The Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning (CogACLL) took place on
April 26, 2014 in Gothenburg, Sweden, in conjunction with the 14th Conference of the European Chapter
of the Association for Computational Linguistics. The workshop was endorsed by ACL Special Interest
Group on Natural Language Learning (SIGNLL). This is the fifth edition of related workshops that was
first held at ACL 2007 in Prague, EACL 2009 in Athens, EACL 2012 in Avignon and as a standalone
event in Paris 2013.
The workshop is targeted at anyone interested in the relevance of computational techniques for
understanding first, second and bilingual language acquisition and change or loss in normal and
pathological conditions.
The human ability to acquire and process language has long attracted interest and generated much debate
due to the apparent ease with which such a complex and dynamic system is learnt and used on the face
of ambiguity, noise and uncertainty. This subject raises many questions ranging from the nature vs.
nurture debate of how much needs to be innate and how much needs to be learned for acquisition to be
successful, to the mechanisms involved in this process (general vs specific) and their representations in
the human brain. There are also developmental issues related to the different stages consistently found
during acquisition (e.g. one word vs. two words) and possible organizations of this knowledge. These
have been discussed in the context of first and second language acquisition and bilingualism, with cross
linguistic studies shedding light on the influence of the language and the environment.
The past decades have seen a massive expansion in the application of statistical and machine learning
methods to natural language processing (NLP). This work has yielded impressive results in numerous
speech and language processing tasks, including e.g. speech recognition, morphological analysis,
parsing, lexical acquisition, semantic interpretation, and dialogue management. The good results have
generally been viewed as engineering achievements. Recently researchers have begun to investigate the
relevance of computational learning methods for research on human language acquisition and change.
The use of computational modeling is a relatively recent trend boosted by advances in machine learning
techniques, and the availability of resources like corpora of child and child-directed sentences, and data
from psycholinguistic tasks by normal and pathological groups. Many of the existing computational
models attempt to study language tasks under cognitively plausible criteria (such as memory and
processing limitations that humans face), and to explain the developmental stages observed in the
acquisition and evolution of the language abilities. In doing so, computational modeling provides insight
into the plausible mechanisms involved in human language processes, and inspires the development of
better language models and techniques. These investigations are very important since if computational
techniques can be used to improve our understanding of human language acquisition and change, these
will not only benefit cognitive sciences in general but will reflect back to NLP and place us in a better
position to develop useful language models.
We invited submissions on relevant topics, including:

language acquisition
• Investigations and comparisons of supervised, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods for
learning (e.g. machine learning, statistical, symbolic, biologically-inspired, active learning,
various hybrid models) from a cognitive perspective.

Submissions included works on specific languages like English, Portuguese and German, along with
crosslinguistic studies. Besides paper presentations the technical program included two invited talks by
Philippe Blache, from Aix-Marseille Université and CNRS (France) and Alexander Clark, from King’s
College London (UK).

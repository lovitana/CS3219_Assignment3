Learning Analytics can be conceptual-
ized as an action control process. Infor-
mation is collected at the behavioral level
and then re-mapped to serve diagnosis at
higher levels of control. We describe the
rationale for moving up the ladder of be-
havior control with examples from eye-
tracking and clickstream analysis.

Sensors used in analytics collect data at low tem-
poral resolutions. Eye-tracking systems for ex-
ample record gaze at a very high rate (250 Hz)
without semantic information. Similarly, click-
stream data collected online represent atomic
actions that do not reflect the orientation of the
learner’s behavior. On the opposite, the expected
output of an analytics system should inform de-
cision-making at a much higher level, for exam-
ple, is a learner going to drop out of a course at
the end of a week, or do partners understand each
other. The gap between sensor data and indica-
tors useful for decision requires the re-mapping
of behavioral streams into cognitively meaning-
ful indicators. The computation of indicators
should ideally be content independent and cali-
bration free.
We will describe the development of
gaze indicators that reflect the breadth of the fo-
cus of attention and the coupling between a lis-
tener and a speaker. In dyadic interaction, these
indicators are related to the level of abstraction
of dialogue and the quality of interaction. We
extended the rationale of these indicators to the
case of one user listening to a video lecture with
the notion of with-me-ness: similar to teachers
wondering whether their students are “with
them”. Students who attend more closely to the
references made by the teacher indeed achieve
better learning.
An obvious limitation of gaze-based ana-
lytics is that eye-trackers are not (yet) wide-
spread. We are investigating whether video-
watching behavior captured by clickstream logs
can serve as a proxy for attention. First results
are encouraging and show that it is possible to
define an information-processing index that re-
flects the engagement of learners with the video.
This indicator is sensitive to both in video drop-
out and course drop-out and reflects whether stu-
dents process video superficially (speeding up,
scrolling forward) or more intensively (checking
back for reference, rewatching). Similar to the
approach we followed for gaze re-mapping, we
aggregate the atomic actions (Play, Pause, Seek
back) into more meaningful actions that are psy-
chologically more meaningful to assess learning
strategies.

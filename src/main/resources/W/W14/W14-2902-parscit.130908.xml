Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999983157894737">
We present a supervised learning method
for verbal valency frame detection and se-
lection, i.e., a specific kind of word sense
disambiguation for verbs based on subcat-
egorization information, which amounts
to detecting mentions of events in text.
We use the rich dependency annotation
present in the Prague Dependency Tree-
banks for Czech and English, taking ad-
vantage of several analysis tools (taggers,
parsers) developed on these datasets pre-
viously. The frame selection is based on
manually created lexicons accompanying
these treebanks, namely on PDT-Vallex for
Czech and EngVallex for English. The re-
sults show that verbal predicate detection
is easier for Czech, but in the subsequent
frame selection task, better results have
been achieved for English.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999974714285714">
Valency frames are a detailed semantic and syn-
tactic description of individual predicate senses.1
As such, they represent different event types. We
present a system for automatic detection and se-
lection of verbal valency frames in Czech and En-
glish, which corresponds to detecting and disam-
biguating mentions of events in text. This is an im-
portant step toward event instance identification,
which should help greatly in linking the mentions
of a single event. We took advantage of the fact
that the Prague family of dependency treebanks
contains comparable valency frame annotation for
Czech and English (cf. Section 2). Thus the fea-
ture templates used in frame selection are the same

in certain theories, also for other parts of speech; however,
we focus on verbal valency only, as it is most common and
sufficiently described in theory and annotated in treebanks.

and the features initially considered differ only in
their instantiation (cf. Section 3).
While somewhat similar to the CoNLL 2009
Shared Task (Hajiˇc et al., 2009) in the predicate
detection part, our task differs from the semantic
role labeling task in that the whole frame has to
be detected, not only individual arguments, and is
therefore more difficult not only in terms of scor-
ing, but also in the selection part: several verbal
frames might share the same syntactic features,
making them virtually indistinguishable unless se-
mantics is taken into account, combined with a de-
tailed grammatical and morphological context.

2 Valency in the tectogrammatical
description
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910230769231">
The annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency
Treebank (Bejˇcek et al., 2012, PDT) and the
Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (Ha-
jiˇc et al., 2012, PCEDT) is based on the formal
framework of the Functional Generative Descrip-
tion (Sgall, 1967; Sgall et al., 1986, FGD), de-
veloped within the Prague School of Linguistics.
The FGD is dependency-oriented with a “strati-
ficational” (layered) approach to a systematic de-
scription of a language. The notion of valency in
the FGD is one of the core concepts operating on
the layer of linguistic meaning (tectogrammatical
layer, t-layer).

2.1 Valency frames
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927">
The FGD uses syntactic as well as semantic crite-
ria to identify verbal complements. It is assumed
that all semantic verbs – and, potentially, nouns,
adjectives, and adverbs – have subcategorization
requirements, which can be specified in the va-
lency frame.
Verbal valency modifications are specified
along two axes: The first axis concerns the (gen-
eral) opposition between inner participants (argu-
ments) and free modifications (adjuncts). This dis-

tinction is based on criteria relating to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.961261166666667">
(a) the possibility of the same type of comple-
ment appearing multiple times with the same
verb (arguments cannot), and
(b) the possibility of the occurrence of the given
complements (in principle) with any verb
(typical for adjuncts).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997378666666667">
The other axis relates to the distinction between
(semantically) obligatory and optional comple-
ments of the word, which again is based on cer-
tain operational criteria expressed as the dialogue
test (Panevová, 1974). Five arguments are distin-
guished: Actor (ACT), Patient (PAT), Addressee
(ADDR), Origin (ORIG), and Effect (EFF). The
set of free modifications is much larger than that of
arguments; about 50 types of adjuncts are distin-
guished based on semantic criteria. Their set can
be divided into several subclasses: temporal (e.g.,
TWHEN, TSIN), local (e.g., LOC, DIR3), causal
(such as CAUS, CRIT), and other free modifica-
tions (e.g., MANN for general Manner, ACMP for
Accompaniment, EXT for Extent etc.).
All arguments (obligatory or optional) and
obligatory adjuncts are considered to be part of the
valency frame.

2.2 Tectogrammatical annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99228075">
The PDT is a project for FGD-based manual an-
notation of Czech texts, started in 1996 at the In-
stitute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles
University in Prague. It serves two main purposes:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.900039714285714">
1. to test and validate the FGD linguistic theory,
2. to apply and test machine learning methods for
part-of-speech and morphological tagging, de-
pendency parsing, semantic role labeling, coref-
erence resolution, discourse annotation, natural
language generation, machine translation and
other natural language processing tasks.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999707333333334">
The language data in the PDT are non-abbreviated
articles from Czech newspapers and journals.
The PCEDT contains English sentences from
the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Tree-
bank (Marcus et al., 1993, PTB-WSJ) and their
Czech translations, all annotated using the same
theoretical framework as the PDT.
The annotation of the PDT and the PCEDT is
very rich in linguistic information. Following the
stratificational approach of the FGD, the texts are
annotated at different but interlinked layers. There
are four such layers, two linear and two structured:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996689">
• the word layer (w-layer) – tokenized but other-
wise unanalyzed original text,
• the morphological layer (m-layer) with parts-
of-speech, morphology and lemmatization,
• analytical layer (a-layer) – surface dependency
syntax trees,
• tectogrammatical layer (t-layer) – “deep syn-

<bodyText confidence="0.973387">
tax” trees according to the FGD theory.
While the PDT has all the layers annotated man-
ually, the PCEDT English annotation on the a-
layer has been created by automatic conversion
from the original Penn Treebank, including the
usual head assignment; morphology and the tec-
togrammatical layer are annotated manually, even
if not as richly as for Czech.2
Valency is a core ingredient on the t-layer. Since
valency frames guide, i.a., the labeling of argu-
ments, valency lexicons with sense-distinguished
entries for both languages have been created to en-
sure consistent annotation.

2.3 Valency Lexicons for Czech and English
in the FGD Framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935833333333">
PDT-Vallex (Hajiˇc et al., 2003; Urešová, 2011) is a
valency lexicon of Czech verbs, nouns, and adjec-
tives, created in a bottom-up way during the an-
notation of the PDT. This approach made it pos-
sible to confront the pre-existing valency theory
with the real usage of the language.
Each entry in the lexicon contains a head-
word, according to which the valency frames are
grouped, indexed, and sorted. Each valency frame
includes the frame’s “valency” (number of argu-
ments, or frame members) and the following in-
formation for each argument:

vová (1974)’s dialogue test,
• its required surface form (or several alternative
forms) typically using morphological, lexical
and syntactic constraints.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998057142857143">
Most valency frames are further accompanied by a
note or an example which explains their meaning
and usage. The version of PDT-Vallex used here
contains 9,191 valency frames for 5,510 verbs.

3 Automatic frame selection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993293928571429">
Building on the modules for Czech and English
automatic tectogrammatical annotation used in the
TectoMT translation engine (Žabokrtský et al.,
2008) and the CzEng 1.0 corpus (Bojar et al.,
2012),4 we have implemented a system for au-
tomatic valency frame selection within the Treex
NLP Framework (Popel and Žabokrtský, 2010).
The frame selection system is based on logistic
regression from the LibLINEAR package (Fan et
al., 2008). We use separate classification models
for each verbal lemma showing multiple valency
frames in the training data. Due to identical anno-
tation schemata in both languages, our models use
nearly the same feature set,5 consisting of:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.988347142857143">
• the surface word form of the lexical verb and all
its auxiliaries,
• their morphological attributes, such as part-of-
speech and grammatical categories,
• formemes – compact symbolic morphosyn-
tactic labels (e.g., v:fin for a finite verb,
v:because+fin for a finite verb governed
by a subordinating conjunction, v:in+ger for
a gerund governed by a preposition),6
• syntactic labels given by the dependency parser,
• all of the above properties found in the topolog-
ical and syntactic neighborhood of the verbal
node on the t-layer (parent, children, siblings,
nodes adjacent in the word order).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.856654923076923">
We experimented with various classifier settings
(regularization type and cost C, termination crite-
rion E) and feature selection techniques (these in-
volve adding a subset of features according to a
metric against the target class).7
3This process resulted in the interlinkage of both lexicons,
with additional links to VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) where avail-
able. Due to the refinement, the mapping is often not 1:1.
4Note that annotation used in TectoMT and CzEng does
not contain all attributes found in corpora manually annotated
on the tectogrammatical layer. Valency frame IDs are an ex-
ample of an attribute that is missing from the automatic an-
notation of CzEng 1.0.

of-speech tagsets used.

4 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973725">
We evaluated the system described in Section 3
on PDT 2.5 for Czech and on the English part
of PCEDT 2.0 for English. From PCEDT 2.0,
whose division follows the PTB-WSJ, we used
Sections 02-21 as training data, Section 24 as
development data, and Section 23 as evaluation
data. Since the system is intended to be used in
a fully automatic annotation scenario, we use au-
tomatically parsed sentences with projected gold-
standard valency frames to train the classifiers.
The results of our system in the best setting
for both languages are given in Table 1.8 The
unlabeled figures measure the ability of the sys-
tem to detect that a valency frame should be filled
for a given node. The labeled figures show the
overall system performance, including selecting
the correct frame. The frame selection accuracy
value shows only the percentage of frames se-
lected correctly, disregarding misplaced frames.
The accuracy for ambiguous verbs further disre-
gards frames of lemmas where only one frame is
possible. Here we include a comparison of our
trained classifier with a baseline that always se-
lects the most frequent frame seen in the training
data.9 Our results using the classifier for both lan-
guages have been confirmed by pairwise bootstrap
resampling (Koehn, 2004) to be significantly bet-
ter than the baseline at 99% level.
We can see that the system is more successful
in Czech in determining whether a valency frame
should be filled for a given node. This is most
probably given by the fact that the most Czech
verbs are easily recognizable by their morphologi-
cal endings, whereas English verbs are more prone
to be misrepresented as nouns or adjectives.
The English system is better at selecting the cor-
rect valency frame. This is probably caused by
a more fine-grained word sense resolution in the
Czech valency lexicon, where more figurative uses
and idioms are included. For example, over 16%

and an average of the ranks given by mRMR and MI.
8The best setting for Czech uses L1-regularization and

As mentioned previously, the task of detecting and
selecting valency frames overlaps with semantic
role labeling (Hajiˇc et al., 2009). However, there
are substantial differences: we have focused only
on verbs (as opposed to all words with some se-
mantic relation marked in the data), and evaluated
on the exact frame assigned to the occurrence of
the verb in the treebank. On the other hand, we
are also evaluating predicate identification as in
Surdeanu et al. (2008), which Hajiˇc et al. (2009)
do not. Tagging and parsing have been automatic,
but not performed jointly with the frame selec-
tion task. This also explains that while the best
results reported for the CoNLL 2009 Shared task
(Björkelund et al., 2009) are 85.41% labeled F-1
for Czech and 85.63% for English, they are not
comparable due to several reasons, the main be-
ing that SRL evaluates each argument separately,
while for a frame to be counted as correct in our
task, the whole frame (by means of the refer-
ence ID) must be selected correctly, which is sub-
stantially harder (if only for verbs). Moreover,
we have used the latest version of the PDT (the
PDT 2.5), and EngVallex-annotated verbs in the
PCEDT, while the English CoNLL 2009 Shared
Task is PropBank-based.10

Selecting valency frames is also very similar to
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), see e.g. (Ed-
monds and Cotton, 2001; Chen and Palmer, 2005).
The WSD however does not consider subcatego-
rization/valency information explicitly.
Previous works on the PDT include a rule-based
tool of Honetschläger (2003) and experiments by
Semecký (2007) using machine learning. Both of
them, unlike our work, used gold-standard anno-

6 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993012">
We have presented a method of detecting mentions
of events in the form of verbal valency frame se-
lection for Czech and English. This method is
based on logistic regression with morphological
and syntactic features, trained on treebanks with
a comparable annotation scheme. We believe that
these results are first for this task on the granu-
larity of the lexicons (PDT-Vallex for Czech and
EngVallex for English), and they seem to be en-
couraging given that the most frequent verbs like
to be and to have have tens of possible frames,
heavily weighing down the resulting scores.
We plan to extend this work to use additional
features and lexical clustering, as well as to see
if the distinctions in the lexicons are justified, i.e.
if humans can effectively distinguish them in the
first place, similar to the work of Cinková et al.
(2012). A natural extension is to combine this
work with argument labeling to match or improve
on the “perfect proposition” score of Surdeanu et
al. (2008) while still keeping the sense distinctions
on top of it. We could also compare this to other
languages for which similar valency lexicons ex-
ist, such as SALSA for German (Burchardt et al.,
2006) or Chinese PropBank (Xue, 2008).

<abstract confidence="0.99681945">We present a supervised learning method for verbal valency frame detection and selection, i.e., a specific kind of word sense disambiguation for verbs based on subcategorization information, which amounts to detecting mentions of events in text. We use the rich dependency annotation present in the Prague Dependency Treebanks for Czech and English, taking advantage of several analysis tools (taggers, parsers) developed on these datasets previously. The frame selection is based on manually created lexicons accompanying these treebanks, namely on PDT-Vallex for Czech and EngVallex for English. The results show that verbal predicate detection is easier for Czech, but in the subsequent frame selection task, better results have been achieved for English.</abstract>

However, there are substantial differences: we have focused only on verbs (as opposed to all words with some semantic relation marked in the data), and evaluated on the exact frame assigned to the occurrence of the verb in the treebank. On the other hand, we are also evaluating predicate identification as in Surdeanu et al. (2008), which Hajiˇc et al. (2009) do not. Tagging and parsing have been automatic, but not performed jointly with the frame selection task. This also explains that while the best results reported for the CoNLL 2009 Shared task (Björkelund et al., 2009) are 85.41% labeled F-1 for Czech and 85.63% for English, they are not comparable due to several reasons, the main being that SRL evaluates each argument separately, while for a frame to be counted as correct in our task, the whole frame (by means of the reference ID) must be selected correctly, which is substantially harder (if only for verbs). Moreover, we have used the latest version of the PDT (the PDT 2.5), and EngVallex-annotated verbs in the PCEDT, while the English CoNLL 2009 Shared Task is PropBank-based.10 10Please recall that EngVallex is a manually refined PropBank with different l</context>

We believe that these results are first for this task on the granularity of the lexicons (PDT-Vallex for Czech and EngVallex for English), and they seem to be encouraging given that the most frequent verbs like to be and to have have tens of possible frames, heavily weighing down the resulting scores. We plan to extend this work to use additional features and lexical clustering, as well as to see if the distinctions in the lexicons are justified, i.e. if humans can effectively distinguish them in the first place, similar to the work of Cinková et al. (2012). A natural extension is to combine this work with argument labeling to match or improve on the “perfect proposition” score of Surdeanu et al. (2008) while still keeping the sense distinctions on top of it. We could also compare this to other languages for which similar valency lexicons exist, such as SALSA for German (Burchardt et al., 2006) or Chinese PropBank (Xue, 2008).

Each valency frame includes the frame’s “valency” (number of arguments, or frame members) and the following information for each argument: • its label (see Section 2.1), • its (semantic) obligatoriness according to Panevová (1974)’s dialogue test, • its required surface form (or several alternative forms) typically using morphological, lexical and syntactic constraints. Most valency frames are further accompanied by a note or an example which explains their meaning and usage. The version of PDT-Vallex used here contains 9,191 valency frames for 5,510 verbs.

The accuracy for ambiguous verbs further disregards frames of lemmas where only one frame is possible. Here we include a comparison of our trained classifier with a baseline that always selects the most frequent frame seen in the training data.9 Our results using the classifier for both languages have been confirmed by pairwise bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004) to be significantly better than the baseline at 99% level. We can see that the system is more successful in Czech in determining whether a valency frame should be filled for a given node.

The other axis relates to the distinction between (semantically) obligatory and optional complements of the word, which again is based on certain operational criteria expressed as the dialogue test (Panevová, 1974). Five arguments are distinguished: Actor (ACT), Patient (PAT), Addressee (ADDR), Origin (ORIG), and Effect (EFF). The set of free modifications is much larger than that of arguments; about 50 types of adjuncts are distinguished based on semantic criteria. Their set can be divided into several subclasses: temporal (e.g., TWHEN, TSIN), local (e.g., LOC, DIR3), causal (such as CAUS, CRIT), and other free modifications (e.g., MANN for general Manner, ACMP for Accompaniment, EXT for Extent etc.).

The WSD however does not consider subcategorization/valency information explicitly. Previous works on the PDT include a rule-based tool of Honetschläger (2003) and experiments by Semecký (2007) using machine learning. Both of them, unlike our work, used gold-standard annotation with just the frame ID removed. 6 Conclusions We have presented a method of detecting mentions of events in the form of verbal valency frame selection for Czech and English. This method is based on logistic regression with morphological and syntactic features, trained on treebanks with a comparable annotation scheme.

The FGD is dependency-oriented with a “stratificational” (layered) approach to a systematic description of a language. The notion of valency in the FGD is one of the core concepts operating on the layer of linguistic meaning (tectogrammatical layer, t-layer). 2.1 Valency frames The FGD uses syntactic as well as semantic criteria to identify verbal complements.

However, there are substantial differences: we have focused only on verbs (as opposed to all words with some semantic relation marked in the data), and evaluated on the exact frame assigned to the occurrence of the verb in the treebank. On the other hand, we are also evaluating predicate identification as in Surdeanu et al. (2008), which Hajiˇc et al. (2009) do not. Tagging and parsing have been automatic, but not performed jointly with the frame selection task. This also explains that while the best results reported for the CoNLL 2009 Shared task (Björkelund et al., 2009) are 85.41% labeled F-1 for Czech and 85.63% for English, they are not comparable due to several reasons, the main being that SRL evaluates each argument separately, while for a frame to be counted as correct in our task, the whole frame (by means of the reference ID) must be selected correctly, which is substantially harder (if only for verbs).

We plan to extend this work to use additional features and lexical clustering, as well as to see if the distinctions in the lexicons are justified, i.e. if humans can effectively distinguish them in the first place, similar to the work of Cinková et al. (2012). A natural extension is to combine this work with argument labeling to match or improve on the “perfect proposition” score of Surdeanu et al.

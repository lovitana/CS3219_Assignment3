Knowledge representation is heavily based on using terminology, due to the fact that many terms have
precise meanings in a specific domain but not in others. As a consequence, terms becomes
unambiguous and clear, and at last, being useful for conceptualizations, are used as a starting point for
formalizations. Sowa (2000) notes that “most fields of science, engineering, business, and law have
evolved systems of terminology or nomenclature for naming, classifying, and standardizing their
concepts”. As well, Parts Of Speech (POS) present two levels of representation, which are separated
but interlinked: a conceptual-semantic level, pertaining to ontologies, and a syntactic-semantic level,
pertaining to sentence production. Starting from an analysis of problems in existing dictionaries, in
this paper we present formalized Italian Linguistic Resources (LRs) for the Archaeological domain, in
which we integrate/couple formal ontology classes and properties into/to electronic dictionary entries,
using a standardized conceptual reference model. We also add Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD)
references in order to guarantee the interoperability between linguistic and language resources, and
therefore to represent knowledge.

Different models/mechanisms have been developed to overcome knowledge representation issues
deriving from increasing complexity and diversity of linguistic resources.
WordNet, one of the most widespread resource, is based on is-a, part-of and member-of relations
between synsets, which are used to represent concepts. At any rate, WordNet relations are not used in
a consistent way, inasmuch sometimes they are broken or present redundancy (Martin, 2003).
Rule based systems are usually founded on logical rules (Bender, 1996) and fuzzy rules (Zadeh,
1965, 2004; Surmann, 2000).
Generally speaking, the ontology-based approach deals with knowledge representation issues
processing a set of words and their semantic relations in a certain domain (Gruber, 1993; Cocchiarella,
1996; Brewster et al., 2004; Tijerino et al., 2005; Sanchez, 2010; Hao, 2010; Wang et al., 2011).
We intend to develop a linguistic knowledge base, i.e. a lexical database, in which the ontology
schema will be integrated to process language on the basis of syntactic relations, i.e. formal grammars.

<bodyText confidence="0.982065">
In order to develop our LRs, we apply Lexicon-Grammar (LG) theoretical and practical framework,
which describes the mechanisms of word combinations and gives an exhaustive description of natural
language lexical and syntactic structures. LG was set up by the French linguist Maurice Gross, during
the ‘60s, and subsequently applied to Italian by Annibale Elia, Maurizio Martinelli and Emilio
D&apos;Agostino. All electronic dictionaries, built according to LG descriptive method, form the DELA1
System, which works as a linguistic engine embedded in automatic textual analysis software systems
and parsers2. Our LRs also include information taken from the Thesauri and Guidelines of the Italian
Central Institute for the Catalogue and Documentation (ICCD)3.
ICCD resources are organized in:

— Marble sculptures – Sarcophagi and reliefs
— Vocabulary of Metals
— Vocabulary of Glasses
— Vocabulary of Materials
— Vocabulary of Mosaic Pavement Works
— Vocabulary of non-figurative mosaics
— Vocabulary of Mosaics
— Vocabulary of Coroplastics.
Only the Object definition dictionary provides, for each entry, the following different and structured
information: Broader Term [BT], Broader Term Partitive [BTP1], Broader Term Partitive [BTP2],
Narrower Term [NT], Narrower Term Partitive [NTP], Use [USE], Use For [UF].

<bodyText confidence="0.999893142857143">
Broader term fields indicate the taxonomy classification, so amuleto (amulet) is an element of
Strumenti, Utensili e Oggetti d&apos;uso (Tools), which is a general category, and Amuleti e oggetti per uso
cerimoniale, magico e votivo (Magic &amp; Votive Supplies), which is a specific category.
The NTP field specifies the lemma, and this helps us to infer that amuleto occurs in different
compound entries, for instance: amuleto a forma di anatra (duck amulet), amuleto a forma di ariete
(ram amulet) and so on. UF is a no-preferential lemma (i.e. a variant); this implies that cornetto (horn
amulet) can stand for amuleto (and its specific types), but ICCD guidelines suggest to use the first one.
According to our approach, it is necessary to lemmatize all possible variants, including those having
even a low-frequency use.
Our electronic dictionary4, which represents an additional resource to the ICCD ones listed above, is
composed by ca. 11000 entries, with both simple and compound words, including spelling variants,
i.e.: (dinos+dynos+dèinos) con anse ad anello (ringed-handle (dinos+dynos+dèinos)), and synonyms,
generally extracted from the UF field, i.e. kylix a labbro risparmiato (spared-lip kylix), which stands
for lip cup or cratere (crater)which stands for vaso (vase).

3.1 Formal, syntactic and semantic features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.902784181818182">
The main formal structures recorded in our electronic dictionary are:
— Noun+Preposition+Noun+Preposition+Noun (NPNPN), i.e. fibula ad arco a coste (ribbed-
arch fibula);
— Noun+Preposition+Noun+Adjective (NPNA), i.e. anello a capi ritorti (twisted-heads ring);
— Noun+Preposition+Noun+Adjective+Adjective (NPNAA), i.e. punta a foglia larga ovale
(oval broadleaf point).
We also notice the presence of open series compounds. Open series compounds are multi-words in
which we can identify one or more fixed elements co-occurring with one or more variable ones, i.e.
palmetta a (cinque+sei+sette+DNUM) petali (little plam with (five+six+seven+DNUM) petals).
As for semantics, we observe the presence of compounds in which the head does not occur in the
first position; for instance, the open series frammenti di (terracotta+anfora+laterizi+N) (fragments of
(clay+anphora+bricks+N)), places the heads at the end of the compounds, being frammenti
(fragments) used to explicit the notion “N0 is a part of N1”.
As far as syntactic aspects are concerned, some open series compounds, especially referred to
coroplastic description, are sentence reductions5 in which it is used a present participle construction.
For instance statua raffigurante Sileno (Silenus statue) is a reduction of the sentence:
Questa statua raffigura Sileno (This statue represents Silenus)
[relative] → Questa è una statua che raffigura Sileno (This is a statue which represents Silenus)
[pr. part.] → Questa è una statua raffigurante Sileno (This is a statue representing Silenus).
In compounds containing present participle forms, semantic features can be identified using local
grammars built on specific verb classes (semantic predicate sets); in such cases, co-occurrence
restrictions can be described in terms of lexical forms and syntactic structures.

4 Ontology-Based Electronic Dictionary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979852869565217">
An ontology-based electronic dictionary is likely to incorporate more information than thesauri. This
comes from the fact that with reference to a thesaurus, an ontology also stores language-independent
information and semantic relations. Therefore, the use of ontology in the upgrading of LG electronic
dictionaries may ensure knowledge sharing, maintenance of semantic constraints, semantic
ambiguities solving, and inferencing on the basis of ontology concept networks.
As far as our ontology schema is concerned, we refer to ICOM International Committee for
Documentation (CIDOC) Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), an ISO standard since 2006,
compatible with the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It provides definitions and a formal
structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in Cultural Heritage
documentation.
In our dictionary, for each entry we indicate:
— its POS (Category), internal structure and inflectional code6 (FLX);
— its variants (VAR) and synonyms (SYN), if any;
— the type of link (LINK) (RDF and/or HTML);
— with reference to our taxonomy, the pertaining knowledge domain7 (DOM);
— the CIDOC CRM Class (CCL).

5 Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) Integration
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999646">
The LLOD is a project developed by the Open Linguistics Working Group (OLWG). It aims to create
a representation formalism for corpora in Resource Description Framework/Web Ontology Language
(RDF/OWL). The initiative intends to link LRs, represented in RDF, with the resources available in
the Linked Open Data (LOD)8 cloud. The LLOD goal is not only to provide LRs in an interoperable
way, but also to use an open license and link LRs with other resources in order to combine information
from different knowledge sources. According to the LOD paradigm (Berners-Lee, 2006), Web
resources have to present a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for entities to which they refer to, and
to include links to other resources. According to Chiarcos et al. (2013a), “linking to central
terminology repositories facilitates conceptual interoperability”.
Benefits of LLOD are also identified in linking through URIs, federation, dynamic linking between
resources (Chiarcos et al., 2013b).
Besides, data structured in RDF format can be queried by means of the SPARQL language. Indeed,
if RDF triples represent a set of relationship among resources, than SPARQL queries are the patterns
for these relationships.
One of the most relevant LLOD resources are stored in and presented by DBpedia
(www.dbpedia.org). DBPedia is a sample of large Linked Datasets, which offers Wikipedia
information in RDF format and incorporate other Web datasets.
Therefore, we have referred and will refer to DBPedia Italian9 datasets to integrate our LRs with
LLOD. DBPedia Italian is an open project developed and maintained by the Web of Data10 research
unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler11.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.9996962">
6All inflectional codes are built by means of local grammars in the form of Finite State Automata/Transducers.
7The taxonomy we use is structured on the basis of the indications given by the ICCD guidelines. Therefore, the tags
RA1SUORC stands for Archaeological Remains/Tools/Receptacles and Containers.

<table confidence="0.77622525">
According to Linked Data prescriptions, URI schema is structured as
http://it.dbpedia.org/resource/ordine_dorico Resource URI

Table 3. Sample of URI schema for the resource ordine dorico (doric order).

In order to reuse such prescriptions, we adopt a Finite State Transducer-based system which merge
specific matching URIs with electronic dictionary entries.

<figureCaption confidence="0.996672">
Figure 2. An example of Finite State Transducer for LLOD integration.

<bodyText confidence="0.999558875">
When we apply the transducer to dictionary entries tagged with “LINK=RDF”, NooJ12 generates a
new string in which the resource URI is placed before the original entry. In this way, the transducer
enriches all entries of our electronic dictionary with DBPedia resources. For instance, the result given
by the transducer for the compound Ordine dorico is the following string:
Resulting strings may be used to automatically read text by means of Web browsers and/or RDF
environments/routines. When the generated string is processed by a Web Browser, it will generate a
link to the HTML representation. Otherwise, when the header “HTTP Accept:” of the query is
produced by a RDF-based application, it will produce a link to the machine-readable representation.

6 Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9411145">
Our future goal is to develop an application useful for both retrieve and process RDF data from LLOD
resources. We intend to implement an environment structured into two workflows: the first one (based
on SPARQL language) to query online repositories and create a system of Question-Answering, the
second one to retrieve natural language strings, in particular those contained in the fields “rdfs:
comment” and “dbpedia-owl: abstract”. Such data will constitute the basis for the development of a
supervised machine-learning algorithm that, through the matching with existing dictionaries and
grammars local, will further upgrade the LRs.

Rule based systems are usually founded on logical rules (Bender, 1996) and fuzzy rules (Zadeh, 1965, 2004; Surmann, 2000). Generally speaking, the ontology-based approach deals with knowledge representation issues processing a set of words and their semantic relations in a certain domain (Gruber, 1993; Cocchiarella, 1996; Brewster et al., 2004; Tijerino et al., 2005; Sanchez, 2010; Hao, 2010; Wang et al., 2011). We intend to develop a linguistic knowledge base, i.e. a lexical database, in which the ontology schema will be integrated to process language on the basis of syntactic relations, i.e. formal grammars.

We also add Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) references in order to guarantee the interoperability between linguistic and language resources, and therefore to represent knowledge. 1 Introduction Knowledge representation is heavily based on using terminology, due to the fact that many terms have precise meanings in a specific domain but not in others. As a consequence, terms becomes unambiguous and clear, and at last, being useful for conceptualizations, are used as a starting point for formalizations. Sowa (2000) notes that “most fields of science, engineering, business, and law have evolved systems of terminology or nomenclature for naming, classifying, and standardizing their concepts”. As well, Parts Of Speech (POS) present two levels of representation, which are separated but interlinked: a conceptual-semantic level, pertaining to ontologies, and a syntactic-semantic level, pertaining to sentence production. Starting from an analysis of problems in existing dictionaries, in this paper we present formalized Italian Linguistic Resources (LRs) for the Archaeological domain, in which we integrate/coup</context>

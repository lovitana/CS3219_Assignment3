The remarkable development of language technology tools in recent years in terms of robustness,
computational speed and volume of processed data, together with the increasing number of languages
covered, made possible their usage not only for specific research applications, but also for real world
applications which prove useful in everyday life. Automatic correction of text, machine translation,
extraction of important information and interaction with devices using speech are just some of these
applications. Language technology now has the maturity to be used for addressing societal challenges
such as helping people with disabilities, the elderly and migrants.
However, due to the ambiguity and complexity of natural language, its automatic processing is still very
challenging and benefits from processing shorter and less ambiguous information. The same is true for
people who have difficulties understanding text due to disabilities, or who have to read texts in a language
they do not have a good command of. In all these cases, automatic text simplification can prove to be
very useful.
In contrast to controlled languages, which practically create a sublanguage by imposing constraints on
the grammar rules, discourse style, number of words in a sentence etc., text simplification eliminates or
replaces parts of sentences or paragraphs, or even reformulates them according to specific requirements
of the target user groups. Among the most frequent techniques are: lexical substitution, verb forms
replacement (for morphologically rich languages), word order adjustments, deletion of subordinate
clauses, replacement of anaphoric pronouns by their reference, usage of synonym expressions with higher
frequency as well as compound splitting.
This workshop intends to bring together scientists working in a variety of fields in which text
simplification can be applied, computational linguists interested in the research problems of text
simplification and of course users who can benefit from the simplified texts.
The innovative aspect of this workshop is its focus on text simplification from two perspectives: On the
one hand, how computational linguistics applications which simplify texts can be used by people in real
world situation, and on the other hand, how to simplify the input for other NLP-based applications in
order to improve their accuracy.
We are happy we could include in the workshop programme contributions dealing with all
aforementioned issues.
Iustin Dornescu, Richard Evans and Constantin Or˘asan report in Relative clause extraction for syntactic
simplification about their results on syntactic text simplification method which focuses on extracting
embedded clauses from structurally complex sentences and rephrasing them without affecting the
original meaning.
In the paper Making Biographical Data in Wikipedia Readable: A Pattern-based Multilingual Approach
the authors (Itziar Gonzalez-Dios, María Jesús Aranzabe and Arantza Díaz de Ilarraza) present
Biographix a tool meant to create simple readable and accessible sentences in Wikipedia articles related
to biographies. The tools is originally designed for Basque and then adapted for five European languages.
The contribution Exploring the effects of Sentence Simplification on Hindi to English Machine
Translation System by Kshitij Mishra, Ankush Soni, Rahul Sharma and Dipti Sharma shows how text
simplification can be used for bringing forward research in Machine Translation.
Ruslav Mitkov and Sanja Štajner introduce in their paper The Fewer the better? A Contrastive Study
about Ways to Simplify a minimal set of rules which ensure a readability close to that one obtained by
applying a long list of more fine-grained rules.

In Automatic Text Simplification For Handling Intellectual Property (The Case of Multiple Patent Claims)
Svetlana Sheremetyeva presents an on-going project on a multi-level text simplification to assist experts
who work on handling intellectural property in patent claims.
A User-View on adequate language resources to be used for txt simplifications is presented in the paper
Assessing Conformance of Manually Simplified Corpora with User Requirements: the Case of Autistic
Readers by Sanja Štajner, Richard Evans and Iustin Dornescu
In Making historical Texts accessible for the crowd, the authors explain which kind of simplification and
adaptation historical texts may go through in order to be accessible to researchers and broad public not
familiar with languages of previous centuries.
We hope that the workshop will contribute to the development of a roadmap of activities, tools and
resources on text simplification from a multilingual perspective, roadmap which we think to be absolutely
necessary for ensuring advances in this intriguing research field.
The organising committee would like to thank to the Programme Committee which contributed with very
fast but substantial reviews to the workshop programme

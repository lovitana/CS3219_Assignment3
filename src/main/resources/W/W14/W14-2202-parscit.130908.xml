In this paper, we describe how field lin-
guists can use the WordsEye Linguistics
Tool (WELT) to study endangered lan-
guages. WELT is a tool under devel-
opment for eliciting endangered language
data and formally documenting a lan-
guage, based on WordsEye (Coyne and
Sproat, 2001), a text-to-scene generation
tool that produces 3D scenes from text in-
put. First, a linguist uses WELT to create
elicitation materials and collect language
data. Next, he or she uses WELT to for-
mally document the language. Finally, the
formal models are used to create a text-
to-scene system that takes input in the en-
dangered language and generates a picture
representing its meaning.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996120967742">
Although languages have appeared and disap-
peared throughout history, today languages are
facing extinction at an unprecedented pace. Over
40% of the estimated 7,000 languages in the world
are at risk of disappearing. When languages die,
we lose access to an invaluable resource for study-
ing the culture, history, and experience of people
who spoke them (Alliance for Linguistic Diversity,
2013). Efforts to document languages and develop
tools to support these efforts become even more
important with the increasing rate of extinction.
Bird (2009) emphasizes a particular need to make
use of computational linguistics during fieldwork.
To address this issue, we are developing the
WordsEye Linguistics Tool, WELT. In one mode
of operation, we provide field linguists with tools
for building elicitation sessions based on custom
3D scenes. In another, we provide a way to for-
mally document the endangered language. For-
mal hypotheses can be verified using a text-to-
scene system that takes input in the endangered
language, analyzes it based on the formal model,
and generates a picture representing the meaning.
WELT provides important advantages to field
linguists for elicitation over the current practice of
using a set of pre-fabricated static pictures. Using
WELT the linguist can create and modify scenes
in real time, based on informants’ responses, cre-
ating follow-up questions and scenes to support
them. Since the pictures WELT supports are 3D
scenes, the viewpoint can easily be changed, al-
lowing exploration of linguistic descriptions based
on different frames of reference, as for elicitations
of spatial descriptions. Finally, since scenes and
objects can easily be added in the field, the lin-
guist can customize the images used for elicitation
to be maximally relevant to the current informants.
Creating a text-to-scene system for an endan-
gered language with WELT also has advantages.
First, WELT allows documentation of the seman-
tics of a language in a formal way. Linguists can
customize the focus of their studies to be as deep
or shallow as they wish; however, we believe that a
major advantage of documenting a language with
WELT is that it enables studies that are much more
precise. The fact that a text-to-scene system is cre-
ated from this documentation will allow linguists
to test the theories they develop with native speak-
ers, making changes to grammars and semantics
in real time. The resulting text-to-scene system
can also be an important tool for language preser-
vation, spreading interest in the language among
younger generations of the community and re-
cruiting new speakers.
In this paper, we discuss the WELT toolkit and
its intended use, with examples from Arrernte and
Nahuatl. In Section 2 we discuss prior work on
field linguistics computational tools. In Section 3
we present an overview of the WELT system. We
describe using WELT for elicitation in Section 4
and describe the tools for language documentation
in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6.

Computational tools for field linguistics fall into
two categories: tools for native speakers to use
directly, without substantial linguist intervention,
and tools for field linguists to use. Tools intended
for native speakers include the PAWS starter kit
(Black and Black, 2009), which uses the answers
to a series of guided questions to produce a draft
of a grammar. Similarly, Bird and Chiang (2012)
describe a simplified workflow and supporting MT
software that lets native speakers produce useable
documentation of their language on their own.
One of the most widely-used toolkits in the lat-
ter category is SIL FieldWorks (SIL FieldWorks,
2014), or specifically, FieldWorks Language Ex-
plorer (FLEx). FLEx includes tools for elicit-
ing and recording lexical information, dictionary
development, interlinearization of texts, analysis
of discourse features, and morphological analy-
sis. An important part of FLEx is its “linguist-
friendly” morphological parser (Black and Si-
mons, 2006), which uses an underlying model
of morphology familiar to linguists, is fully in-
tegrated into lexicon development and interlin-
ear text analysis, and produces a human-readable
grammar sketch as well as a machine-interpretable
parser. The morphological parser is constructed
“stealthily” in the background, and can help a lin-
guist by predicting glosses for interlinear texts.
Linguist’s Assistant (Beale, 2011) provides a
corpus of semantic representations for linguists to
use as a guide for elicitation. After eliciting the
language data, a linguist writes rules translating
these semantic representations into surface forms.
The result is a description of the language that can
be used to generate text from documents that have
been converted into the semantic representation.
Linguists are encouraged to collect their own elic-
itations and naturally occurring texts and translate
them into the semantic representation.
The LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al.,
2002) facilitates formal modeling of syntax by
generating basic HPSG “starter grammars” for
languages from the answers to a typological ques-
tionnaire. Extending a grammar beyond the proto-
type, however, does require extensive knowledge
of HPSG, making this tool more feasibly used by
grammar engineers and computational linguists.
For semantics, the most common resource for for-
mal documentation across languages is FrameNet
(Filmore et al., 2003); FrameNets have been de-
veloped for many languages, including Spanish,
Japanese, and Portuguese. However, FrameNet is
also targeted toward computational linguists.
In general, we also lack tools for creating cus-
tom elicitation materials. With WELT, we hope to
fill some of the gaps in the range of available field
linguistics tools. WELT will enable the creation of
custom elicitation material and facilitate the man-
agement sessions with an informant. WELT will
also enable formal documentation of the semantics
of a language without knowledge of specific com-
putational formalisms. This is similar to the way
FLEx allows linguists to create a formal model of
morphology while also documenting the lexicon
of a language and glossing interlinear texts.

3 Overview of WELT Workflow
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999157">
In this section, we briefly describe the workflow
for using WELT; a visual representation is pro-
vided in Figure 1. Since we are still in the early
stages of our project, this workflow has not been
tested in practice. The tools for scene creation and
elicitation are currently useable, although more
features will be added in the future. The tools for
modeling and documentation are still in develop-
ment; although some functionality has been imple-
mented, we are still testing it with toy grammars.
First, WELT will be used to prepare a set of 3D
scenes to be used to elicit targeted descriptions or
narratives. An important part of this phase will be
the cultural adaptation of the graphical semantics
used in WordsEye, so that scenes will be relevant
to the native speakers a linguist works with. We
will discuss cultural adaptation in more detail in
Section 4.1. Next, the linguist will work with an
informant to generate language data based on pre-
pared 3D scenes. This can be a dynamic process;
as new questions come up, a linguist can easily
modify existing scenes or create new ones. WELT
also automatically syncs recorded audio with open
scenes and provides an interface for the linguist to
write notes, textual descriptions, and glosses. We
will discuss creating scenes and eliciting data with
WELT in Section 4.2. After the elicitation session,
the linguist can use WELT to review the data col-
lected, listen to the audio recorded for each scene,
and revise notes and glosses. The linguist can then
create additional scenes to elicit more data or be-
gin the formal documentation of the language.

and semantics of a language. Since the focus
of WELT is on semantics, the formalisms used
to model morphology and syntax may vary. We
are using FieldWorks to document Nahuatl mor-
phology, XFST (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) to
model Arrernte morphology, and XLE (Crouch et
al., 2011) to model syntax in the LFG formal-
ism (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). We will provide
tools to export WELT descriptions and glosses
into FLEx format and to export the lexicon cre-
ated during documentation into FLEx and XLE.
WELT will provide user interfaces for modeling
the syntax-semantics interface, lexical semantics,
and graphical semantics of a language. We will
discuss these in more detail in Section 5.3.
Once models of morphology, syntax, and se-
mantics are in place (note that these can be work-
ing models, and need not be complete), WELT
puts the components together into a text-to-scene
system that takes input in the endangered language
and uses the formal models to generate pictures.
This system can be used to verify theories with in-
formants and revise grammars. As new questions
arise, WELT can also continue to be used to create
elicitation materials and collect linguistic data.
Finally, we will create a website for WELT so
linguists can share resources such as modified ver-
sions of VigNet, 3D scenes, language data col-
lected, and formal grammars. This will allow
comparison of analyses across languages, as well
as facilitate the documentation of other languages
that are similar linguistically or spoken by cul-
turally similar communities. In addition, sharing
the resulting text-to-scene systems with a wider
audience can generate interest in endangered lan-
guages and, if shared with endangered-language-
speaking communities, encourage younger mem-
bers of the community to use the language.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872222222222">
WELT organizes elicitation sessions around a set
of 3D scenes, which are created by inputting En-
glish text into WordsEye. Scenes can be imported
and exported between sessions, so that useful
scenes can be reused and data compared. WELT
also provides tools for recording audio (which is
automatically synced with open scenes), textual
descriptions, glosses, and notes during a session.

4.1 Cultural Adaptation of VigNet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969153846154">
To interpret input text, WordsEye uses VigNet
(Coyne et al., 2011), a lexical resource based on
FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). As in FrameNet,
lexical items are grouped in frames according to
shared semantic structure. A frame contains a set
of frame elements (semantic roles). FrameNet de-
fines the mapping between syntax and semantics
for a lexical item with valence patterns that map
syntactic functions to frame elements.
VigNet extends FrameNet in order to capture
“graphical semantics”, a set of graphical con-
straints representing the position, orientation, size,
color, texture, and poses of objects in the scene,

which is used to construct and render a 3D
scene. Graphical semantics are added to frames by
adding primitive graphical (typically, spatial) rela-
tions between frame element fillers. VigNet distin-
guishes between meanings of words that are dis-
tinguished graphically. For example, the specific
objects (e.g., implements) and spatial relations in
the graphical semantics for cook depend on the
object being cooked and on the culture in which
it is being cooked (cooking turkey in Baltimore
vs. cooking an egg in Alice Springs), even though
at an abstract level cook an egg in Alice Springs
and cook a turkey in Baltimore are perfectly com-
positional semantically. Frames augmented with
graphical semantics are called vignettes.
Vignette Tailoring: Without digressing into a dis-
cussion on linguistic relativity, we assume that
large parts of VigNet are language- and culture-
independent. The low-level graphical relations
used to express graphical semantics are based on
physics and human anatomy and do not depend on
language. However, the graphical semantics for a
vignette may be culture-specific, and some new vi-
gnettes will need to be added for a culture. In the
U.S., for example, the sentence The woman boiled
the water might invoke a scene with a pot of wa-
ter on a stove in a kitchen. Among the Arrernte
people, it would instead invoke a woman sitting
on the ground in front of a kettle on a campfire.
Figure 3 shows an illustration from the Eastern
and Central Arrernte Picture Dictionary (Broad,
2008) of the sentence Ipmenhe-ipmenhele kwatye
urinpe-ilemele iteme, “My grandmother is boiling
the water.” The lexical semantics for the English
verb boil and the Arrente verb urinpe-ileme are
the same, the relation APPLY-HEAT.BOIL. How-
ever, the vignettes map to different, culture-typical
graphical semantics. The vignettes for our exam-
ple are shown in Figure 4.

graphical semantics for existing vignettes that
need to be modified, and new vignettes for scenar-
ios not already covered. We will create interfaces
so that VigNet can easily be adapted.
Custom WordsEye Objects: Another way to
adapt WordsEye to a culture or region is to add rel-
evant 3D objects to the database. WordsEye also
supports 2D-cutout images, which is an easy way
to add new material without 3D modeling. We
have created a corpus of 2D and 3D models for
WordsEye that are specifically relevant to aborig-
inal speakers of Arrernte, including native Aus-
tralian plants and animals and culturally relevant
objects and gestures. Many of the pictures we cre-
ated are based on images from IAD Press, used
with permission, which we enhanced and cropped
in PhotoShop. Some scenes that use these images
are included in Figure 5. Currently, each new ob-
ject has to be manually incorporated into Words-
Eye, but we will create tools to allow WELT users
to easily add pictures and objects.
New objects will also need to be incorporated
into the semantic ontology. VigNet’s ontology
consists of semantic concepts that are linked to-
gether with ISA relations. The ontology supports
multiple inheritance, allowing a given concept to
be a sub-type of more than one concept. For exam-
ple, a PRINCESS.N is a subtype of both FEMALE.N
and ARISTOCRAT.N, and a BLACK-WIDOW.N is a
subtype of SPIDER.N and POISONOUS-ENTITY.N.
Concepts are often linked to corresponding lexi-
cal items. If a lexical item has more than one
word sense, the different word senses would be
represented by different concepts. In addition, ev-
ery graphical object in VigNet is represented by
a unique concept. For example, a particular 3D
model of a dog would be a linked to the general
DOG.N concept by the ISA relation. The semantic
concepts in VigNet include the graphical objects
available in WordsEye as well as concepts tied to
related lexical items. While WordsEye might only
have a handful of graphical objects for dogs, Vi-
gNet will have concepts representing all common
types of dogs, even if there is no graphical object
associated with them. We will provide interfaces
both for adding new objects and for modifying the
semantic concepts in VigNet to reflect the differ-
ing lexical semantics of a new language.

4.2 Preparing Scenes and Eliciting Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979154">
The next step in the workflow is the preparation
of scenes and elicitation of descriptions. To test
creating elicitation materials with WELT, we built
a set of scenes based on the Max Planck topolog-
ical relations picture series (Bowerman and Ped-
erson, 1992). In creating these, we used a feature
of WordsEye that allows highlighting specific ob-
jects (or parts of objects) in a scene. We used these
scenes to elicit descriptions from a native Nahuatl
speaker; some examples are included in Figure 6.

One topic we will explore with WELT is the re-
lationship in Arrernte between case and semantic
interpretation of a sentence. It is possible to signif-
icantly alter a sentence’s meaning by changing the
case on an argument. For example, the sentences
in (1) from Wilkins (1989) show that adding dative

case to the direct object of the sentence changes
the meaning from shooting and hitting the kanga-
roo to shooting at the kangaroo and not hitting it.
Wilkins calls this the “dative of attempt.”

In order to see how this example generalizes,
we will create pairs of pictures, one in which the
object of the sentence is acted upon, and one in
which the object fails to be acted upon. Figure 7
shows a pair of scenes contrasting an Australian
football player scoring a goal with a player aiming
at the goal but missing the shot. Sentences (2) and
(3) are two ways of saying “score a goal” in Ar-
rernte; we want to see if a native Arrernte speaker
would use goal-ke in place of goal in this context.

5 Modeling a Language with WELT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999900394736842">
WELT includes tools for documenting the seman-
tics of the language. It also uses this documenta-
tion to automatically generate a text-to-scene sys-
tem for the language. Because WELT is centered
around the idea of 3D scenes, the formal docu-
mentation will tend to focus on the parts of the se-
mantics that can be represented graphically. Note
that this can include figurative concepts as well,
although the visual representation of these may be
culture-specific. However, linguists do not need
to be limited by the graphical output; WELT can
be used to document other aspects of semantics as
well, but linguists will not be able to verify these
theories using the text-to-scene system.
To explain the necessary documentation, we
briefly describe the underlying architecture of
WordsEye, and how we are adapting it to sup-
port text-to-scene systems for other languages.
The WordsEye system parses each input sentence
into a labeled syntactic dependency structure, then
converts it into a lexical-semantic structure using
lexical valence patterns and other lexical and se-
mantic information. The resulting set of seman-
tic relations is converted to a “graphical seman-
tics”, the knowledge needed to generate graphical
scenes from language.
To produce a text-to-scene system for a new lan-
guage, WELT must replace the English linguistic
processing modules with models for the new lan-
guage. The WELT processing pipeline is illus-
trated in Figure 8, with stages of the pipeline on
top and required resources below. In this section,
we will discuss creating the lexicon, morphologi-
cal and syntactic parsers, and syntax-to-semantics
rules. The vignettes and 3D objects will largely
have been done during cultural adaptation of Vi-
gNet; additional modifications needed to handle
the semantics can be defined using the same tools.

building the lexicon begins during elicitation.
WELT’s elicitation interface includes an option to
display each object in the scene individually be-
fore progressing to the full scene. When an object
is labeled and glossed in this way, the word and
the semantic concept represented by the 3D ob-
ject are immediately added to the lexicon. Word
forms glossed in scene descriptions will also be
added to the lexicon, but will need to be mapped
to semantic concepts later. WELT will provide

tools for completing the lexicon by modifying
the automatically-added items, adding new lexical
items, and mapping each lexical item to a seman-
tic concept in VigNet. Figure 9(a) shows a partial
mapping of the nouns in our Arrernte lexicon.
WELT includes a visual interface for search-
ing VigNet’s ontology for semantic concepts and
browsing through the hierarchy to select a partic-
ular category. Figure 9(b) shows a portion of the
ontology that results from searching for cup. Here,
we have decided to map panikane to CUP.N. Se-
mantic categories are displayed one level at a time,
so initially only the concepts directly above and
below the search term are shown. From there, it is
simple to click on relevant concepts and navigate
the graph to find an appropriate semantic category.
To facilitate the modeling of morphology and syn-
tax, WELT will also export the lexicon into for-
mats compatible with FieldWorks and XLE, so the
list of word forms can be used as a starting point.

any particular grammatical formalism. For syn-

researching other options that would be more ac-
cessible to non-computational linguists. It is im-
portant to note, though, that the modeling done in
WELT does not require a perfect syntactic parser.
In fact, one can vastly over-generate syntax and
still accurately model semantics. Therefore, the
syntactic grammars provided as models do not
need to be complex. However, the question of syn-
tax is still an open area of research in our project.

this, WELT includes an interface for the linguist to
specify a set of rules that map from syntax to (lex-
ical) semantics. Since we are modeling Arrernte
syntax with LFG, the rules currently take syntactic
f-structures as input, but the system could easily be
modified to accommodate other formalisms. The
left-hand side of a rule consists of a set of con-
ditions on the f-structure elements and the right-
hand side is the desired semantic structure. Rules
are specified by defining a tree structure for the
left-hand (syntax) side and a DAG for the right-
hand (semantics) side.
As an example, we will construct a rule to
process sentence (2) from Section 4.2, artwe le
goal arrerneme. For this sentence, our Arrernte
grammar produces the f-structure in Figure 11.
We create a rule that selects for predicate ar-
rerne with object goal and any subject. Figure
10 shows the construction of this rule in WELT.
Note that var-1 on the left-hand side becomes
VIGNET(var-1) on the right-hand side; this in-
dicates that the lexical item found in the input is
mapped into a semantic concept using the lexicon.

The rule shown in Figure 10 is a very sim-
ple example. Nodes on the left-hand side of
the rule can also contain boolean logic, if we
wanted to allow the subject to be [(artwe ‘man’ OR
arhele ‘woman’) AND NOT ampe ‘child’]. Rules
need not specify lexical items directly but may
refer to more general semantic categories. For
example, our rule could require a particular se-
mantic category for VIGNET(var-1), such as
ANIMATE-BEING.N. These categories are chosen
through the same ontology browser used to cre-
ate the lexicon. Finally, to ensure that our sen-
tence can be converted into graphics, we need
to make sure that a vignette definition exists for
CAUSE MOTION.KICK so that the lexical seman-
tics on the right-hand side of our rule can be aug-
mented with graphical semantics; the vignette def-
inition is given in Figure 12. The WordsEye sys-
tem will use the graphical constraints in the vi-
gnette to build a scene and render it in 3D.

We have described a novel tool under develop-
ment for linguists working with endangered lan-
guages. It will provide a new way to elicit data
from informants, an interface for formally docu-
menting the lexical semantics of a language, and
allow the creation of a text-to-scene system for any
language. In this paper, we have focused specifi-
cally on the workflow that a linguist would fol-
low while studying an endangered language with
WELT. WELT will provide useful tools for field
linguistics and language documentation, from cre-
ating elicitation materials, to eliciting data, to for-
mally documenting a language. In addition, the
text-to-scene system that results from document-
ing an endangered language with WELT will be
valuable for language preservation, generating in-
terest in the wider world, as well as encouraging
younger members of endangered language com-
munities to use the language.

Scenes can be imported and exported between sessions, so that useful scenes can be reused and data compared. WELT also provides tools for recording audio (which is automatically synced with open scenes), textual descriptions, glosses, and notes during a session. Screenshots are included in Figure 2. 4.1 Cultural Adaptation of VigNet To interpret input text, WordsEye uses VigNet (Coyne et al., 2011), a lexical resource based on FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). As in FrameNet, lexical items are grouped in frames according to shared semantic structure. A frame contains a set of frame elements (semantic roles). FrameNet defines the mapping between syntax and semantics for a lexical item with valence patterns that map syntactic functions to frame elements. VigNet extends FrameNet in order to capture “graphical semantics”, a set of graphical constraints representing the position, orientation, size, color, texture, and poses of objects in the scene, 8 Figure 2: Screenshots of WELT elicitation interfaces which is used to construct and render a 3D scene. </context>

Over 40% of the estimated 7,000 languages in the world are at risk of disappearing. When languages die, we lose access to an invaluable resource for studying the culture, history, and experience of people who spoke them (Alliance for Linguistic Diversity, 2013). Efforts to document languages and develop tools to support these efforts become even more important with the increasing rate of extinction. Bird (2009) emphasizes a particular need to make use of computational linguistics during fieldwork. To address this issue, we are developing the WordsEye Linguistics Tool, WELT. In one mode of operation, we provide field linguists with tools for building elicitation sessions based on custom 3D scenes. In another, we provide a way to formally document the endangered language. Formal hypotheses can be verified using a text-toscene system that takes input in the endangered language, analyzes it based on the formal model, and generates a picture representing the meaning.

To test creating elicitation materials with WELT, we built a set of scenes based on the Max Planck topological relations picture series (Bowerman and Pederson, 1992).

Among the Arrernte people, it would instead invoke a woman sitting on the ground in front of a kettle on a campfire.

Scenes can be imported and exported between sessions, so that useful scenes can be reused and data compared. WELT also provides tools for recording audio (which is automatically synced with open scenes), textual descriptions, glosses, and notes during a session. Screenshots are included in Figure 2. 4.1 Cultural Adaptation of VigNet To interpret input text, WordsEye uses VigNet (Coyne et al., 2011), a lexical resource based on FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). As in FrameNet, lexical items are grouped in frames according to shared semantic structure. A frame contains a set of frame elements (semantic roles). FrameNet defines the mapping between syntax and semantics for a lexical item with valence patterns that map syntactic functions to frame elements. VigNet extends FrameNet in order to capture “graphical semantics”, a set of graphical constraints representing the position, orientation, size, color, texture, and poses of objects in the scene, 8 Figure 2: Screenshots of WELT elicitation in</context>

The LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002) facilitates formal modeling of syntax by generating basic HPSG “starter grammars” for languages from the answers to a typological questionnaire. Extending a grammar beyond the prototype, however, does require extensive knowledge of HPSG, making this tool more feasibly used by grammar engineers and computational linguists. For semantics, the most common resource for formal documentation across languages is FrameNet (Filmore et al., 2003); FrameNets have been developed for many languages, including Spanish, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, FrameNet is also targeted toward computational linguists. In general, we also lack tools for creating custom elicitation materials. With WELT, we hope to fill some of the gaps in the range of available field linguistics tools. WELT will enable the creation of custom elicitation material and facilitate the management sessions with an informant. WELT will also enable formal documentation of the semantics of a language without knowledge of specific computational formalisms. This is similar to</context>

Tools intended for native speakers include the PAWS starter kit (Black and Black, 2009), which uses the answers to a series of guided questions to produce a draft of a grammar. Similarly, Bird and Chiang (2012) describe a simplified workflow and supporting MT software that lets native speakers produce useable documentation of their language on their own. One of the most widely-used toolkits in the latter category is SIL FieldWorks (SIL FieldWorks, 2014), or specifically, FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx). FLEx includes tools for eliciting and recording lexical information, dictionary development, interlinearization of texts, analysis of discourse features, and morphological analysis. An important part of FLEx is its “linguistfriendly” morphological parser (Black and Simons, 2006), which uses an underlying model of morphology familiar to linguists, is fully integrated into lexicon development and interlinear text analysis, and produces a human-readable grammar sketch as well as a machine-interpretable parser. The morphological parser is con</context>

It is possible to significantly alter a sentence’s meaning by changing the case on an argument. For example, the sentences in (1) from Wilkins (1989) show that adding dative 10 Figure 5: WordsEye scenes using custom 2D gum tree and dingo from our corpus case to the direct object of the sentence changes the meaning from shooting and hitting the kangaroo to shooting at the kangaroo and not hitting it. Wilkins calls this the “dative of attempt.” (1) a. re aherre tyerre-ke he kangaroo shot-pc He shot the kangaroo. b. re aherre-ke tyerre-ke he kangaroo-DAT shot-pc He shot at the kangaroo (but missed). In order to see how this example generalizes, we will create pairs of pictures, one in which the object of the sentence is acted upon, and one in</context>

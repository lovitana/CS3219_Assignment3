The Coling 2014 Workshop on Synchronic and Diachronic Approaches to Analyzing Technical
Language was held on August 24, 2014 in Dublin Ireland.
Technology is the application of knowledge to practical pursuits. Information relevant to technology
is the subject of various types of documents, including: scholarly publications (journals, conference
proceedings, abstracts, grant applications, textbooks); legal documents (patents, contracts, legislation);
and more public venues (magazines, webpages, blogs, financial reports). Interest in the automatic
classification of technical documents has recently been growing and Natural Language Processing is
a major component of such classification systems.
Presented at this workshop were six regular papers and two invited talks on various topics connected to
the linguistic analysis of technical language including work on terminology, citations, Chinese-English
Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, event extraction, literary analysis, named entity recognition,
among other topics. Technical domains investigated included both patents and journal articles.
We thank the invited speakers, program committee, authors, Coling organizers and participants for a
successful workshop.

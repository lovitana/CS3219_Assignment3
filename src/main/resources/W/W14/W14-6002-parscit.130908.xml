NLP definitions of Terminology are usually application-dependent. IR terms are noun sequences
that characterize topics. Terms can also be arguments for relations like abbreviation, definition or
IS-A. In contrast, this paper explores techniques for extracting terms fitting a broader definition:
noun sequences specific to topics and not well-known to naive adults. We describe a chunking-
based approach, an evaluation, and applications to non-topic-specific relation extraction.

Webster’s II New College Dictionary (Houghton Mifflin Company, 2001, p.1138) defines terminology
as: The vocabulary of technical terms and usages appropriate to a particular field, subject, science,
or art. Systems for automatically extracting instances of terminology (terms) usually assume narrow
operational definitions that are compatible with particular tasks. Terminology, in the context of Infor-
mation Retrieval (IR) (Jacquemin and Bourigault, 2003) refers to keyword search terms (microarray,
potato, genetic algorithm), single or multi-word (mostly nominal) expressions collectively representing
topics of documents that contain them. These same terms are also used for creating domain-specific
thesauri and ontologies (Velardi et al., 2001). We will refer to these types of terms as topic-terms and
this type of terminology topic-terminology. In other work, types of terminology (genes, chemical names,
biological processes, etc.) are defined relative to a specific field like Chemistry or Biology (Kim et al.,
2003; Corbett et al., 2007; Bada et al., 2010). These classes are used for narrow tasks, e.g., Information
Extraction (IE) slot filling tasks within a particular genre of interest (Giuliano et al., 2006; Bundschus
et al., 2008; BioCreAtIvE, 2006). Other projects are limited to Information Extraction tasks that may
not be terminology-specific, but have terms as arguments, e.g., (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Jin et al.,
2013) detect abbreviation and definition relations respectively and the arguments are terms. In contrast
to this previous work, we have built a system that extracts a larger set of terminology, which we call
jargon-terminology. Jargon-terms may include ultracentrifuge, which is unlikely to be a topic-term of a
current biology article, but will not include potato, a non-technical word that could be a valid topic-term.
We aim to find all the jargon-terms found in a text, not just the ones that fill slots for specific relations.
As we show, jargon-terminology closely matches the notional (e.g., Webster’s) definition of terminol-
ogy. Furthermore, the important nominals in technical documents tend to be jargon-terms, making them
likely arguments of a wide variety of possible IE relations (concepts or objects that are invented, two
nominals that are in contrast, one object that is “better than” another, etc.). Specifically, the identification
of jargon-terms lays the ground for IE tasks that are not genre or task dependent. Our approach which
finds all instances of terms (tokens) in text is conducive to these tasks. In contrast, topic-term detection
techniques find smaller sets of terms (types), each term occurring multiple times and the set of terms
collectively represents a topic, in a similar way that a set of documents can represent a topic.

This paper describes a system for extracting jargon-terms in technical documents (patents and journal
articles); the evaluation of this system using manually annotated documents; and a set of information
extraction (IE) relations which take jargon-terms as arguments. We incorporate previous work in termi-
nology extraction, assuming that terminology is restricted to noun groups (minus some left modifiers)
(Justeson and Katz, 1995); 1 and we use both topic-term extraction techniques (Navigli and Velardi,
2004) and relation-based extraction techniques (Jin et al., 2013) in components of our system. Rather
than looking at the distribution of noun groups as a whole for determining term-hood, we refine the
classes used by the noun group chunker itself, placing limitations on the candidate noun groups pro-
posed and then filtering the output by setting thresholds on the number and quality of the “jargon-like”
components of the phrase. The resulting system admits not only topic-terms, but also other non-topic
instances of terminology. Using the more inclusive set of jargon-terms (rather than just topic-terms) as
arguments of the IE relations in section 6, we are able to detect a larger and more informative set of rela-
tion. Furthermore, these relations are salient for a wide variety of genres (unlike those in (BioCreAtIvE,
2006)) – a genre-neutral definition of terminology makes this possible. For example, the CONTRAST
relation between the two bold face terms in necrotrophic effector systemA1 that is an exciting contrast
to the biotrophic effector modelsA2. would be applicable in most academic genres. Our jargon-terms
also contrast with the tactic of filling terminology slots in relations with any noun-group (Justeson and
Katz, 1995), as such a strategy overgenerates, lowering precision.

2 Topic-term Extraction

Topic-term extractors (Velardi et al., 2001; Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003) collect candidate terms (N-grams,
noun groups, words) that are more representative of a foreground corpus (documents about a specific
topic) than they are of a background corpus (documents about a wide range of topics), using statistical
measures such as Term Frequency (TFIDF), or a variation thereof. Due to the metrics used
</bodyText>

Inverse Document Frequency

<bodyText confidence="0.99983556">
and cutoffs assumed, the list of terms selected is usually no more than a few hundred distinct terms,
even for a large set of foreground documents and tend to be especially salient to that topic. The terms
can be phrases that lay people would not know (e.g., microarray, genetic algorithm) or common topics
for that document set (e.g., potato, computer). Such systems rank all candidate terms, using cutoffs
(minimum scores or percentages of the list) to separate out the highest-ranked terms as output. Thus
sets of topic-terms, derived this way, are dependent on the foreground and background assumed, and the
publication dates. So a precise definition would include such information, e.g., topic-terms(biomedical-
patents, random-patents, 1990–1999) would refer to those topic-terms that differentiate a foreground of
biomedical patents from the 1990s from a background of diverse patents from the same epoch. Narrower
topics are possible (e.g., comparing DNA-microarray patents to the same background); or broader ones
(e.g., if a diverse corpus including news articles, fiction and travel writing are the background set instead
of patents, then patent terms such as national stage application may be highly ranked in the output).
Thus topic-terms generated by these methods model a relationally based definition and are relative to the
chosen foregrounds, backgrounds and dates.
Topic-terms can include words/phrases like potato, wheat, rat, monkey, which may be common sub-
jects of some set of biomedical documents, but are not specific to a technical field. In contrast, jargon-
terms would include words (like ultracentrifuge, theorem, graduated cylinder) that are specific to tech-
nical language, but don’t tend to be topics of any current document of interest. Jargon-terms, like topic-
terms, can be defined relative to a particular foreground (which can also be represented as a set of
documents), but there is the implicit assumption that they all share the same background set: non-genre-
specific language (or simply a very diverse set of documents). It is also possible to refer to terminology in
general as the union of jargon-terms with respect to the set of specialized knowledge areas as foregrounds
and all sharing the same background of non-genre-specific language. Jargon-terms, like topic-terms, are
also time dependent, since some terms will eventually be absorbed into the common lexicon, e.g., com-
puter. However, we can make the simplifying assumption that we are talking about jargon in the present

verb terms (calcify, coactivate) which are crucial to IE.

time. Furthermore, jargon-term status is somewhat less time sensitive than topic-term status because ter-
minology is absorbed very sparingly (and very slowly) into the popular lexicon, whereas topics go in and
out of fashion quickly within a literature that is meant for an expert audience. Ignoring the potato type
cases, topic-terms are a proper subset of jargon-terms and, thus, the set of jargon-terms is larger than the
set of topic-terms. Finally, topic terms are ranked with respect to how well they can serve as keywords,
i.e., how specific they are to a particular document set, whereas +/-jargon-term is a binary distinction.
We built a topic term extractor that combines several metrics together in an ensemble including:
TFIDF, KL Divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991; Hisamitsu et al., 1999) and a combination of Do-
main Relevance and Document Consensus (DRDC) based on (Navigli and Velardi, 2004). Furthermore,
we filtered the output by requiring that each term would be recognized as a term by the jargon-term chun-
ker described below in section 3. We manually scored the top 100 terms generated for two classes of
biology patents (US patent classes 435 and 436) and achieved accuracies of 85% and 76% respectively.
We also manually evaluated the top 100 terms taken from biology articles, yielding an accuracy of about
88%. As discussed, we use the output of this system for our jargon-term extraction system.

3 Jargon-term Extraction by Chunking
</sectionHeader>

(Justeson and Katz, 1995) uses manual rules to detect noun groups (sequences of nouns and adjectives
ending in a noun) with the goal of detecting instances of topic-terms. They filter out those noun groups
that occur only once in the document on the theory that the multiply used noun groups are more likely to
be topics. They manually score their output from two computer science articles and one biotechnology
article, with 146, 350 and 834 instances of terms and achieve accuracies of 96%, 86% and 77%. (Frantzi
et al., 2000) uses linguistic rules similar to noun chunking to detect candidate terms; filters the results
using a stop list and other linguistic constraints; uses statistical filters to determine whether substrings
are likely to be terms as well; and uses statistical filters based on neighboring words (context). (Frantzi et
al., 2000) ranks their terms by scores and achieve about 75% accuracy for the top 40 terms – their system
is tested on medical records (quite a different corpus form ours). Our system identifies all instances
of terminology (not just topic terms) and identifies many more instances per document (919, 1131 and
2166) than (Justeson and Katz, 1995) or (Frank, 2000). As we aim to find all instances of jargon-terms,
we evaluate for both precision and recall rather than just accuracy (section 5). Two of the documents
that we test on are patents, which have a very different word distribution than articles. In fact, due to
both the amount of repetition in patents and the presence of multiple types of terminology (legal terms
as well as topic-related terms), it is hard to imagine that eliminating terms occurring below a frequency
threshold (as with (Justeson and Katz, 1995)) would be an effective method of filtering. Furthermore,
(Frank, 2000) used a very different corpus than we did and they focused on a slightly different problem
(e.g., we did not attempt to find the highest-ranked terms and we did not attempt to find both long terms
and substrings which were terms). Thus while it is appropriate to compare our methodology, it is difficult
to compare our results.
We have implemented a hand-crafted term extractor, which we will call a jargon-term chunker because
it functions in much the same way as a noun group chunker. It uses a deterministic finite state machine,
based on parts of speech (POS) and a fine-tuned set of lexical categories. We observed that jargon-terms
are typically noun groups, minus some left modifiers, and normally include words that are not in standard
vocabulary or belong to certain other classes of words (e.g., nominalizations). While topic-term tech-
niques factor the distribution of whole term sequences into the choice of topic-terms, our method focuses
on the distribution of words within topic-term sequences. The primary function of POS classification is
to cluster words distributionally in a language. A POS tag reflects the syntactic distribution of the word
in the sense that words with the same POS should be able to replace each other in sentences. Morpholog-
ically, POSs are subject to the same morphological variation (prefixes, suffixes, tense, gender, number,
etc.). For example, the English word duck belongs to the POS noun because it tends to occur: after a
determiner, after an adjective, and ending a unit that can be the subject of a verb: nouns are substitutable
for each other. Furthermore, it has a plural form resulting from an -s or -es suffix, etc. Similarly, we
hold that the presence of particular classes of words within a noun group affects its potential to function
</bodyText>

as a jargon-term. As will become evident, we can use topic-term-like metrics to identify some of these
word classes. Furthermore, given our previous assertion that topic-terms are a subset of jargon-terms,
we assume that the most saliently ranked topic-terms are also jargon-terms and words that are commonly
parts of topic-terms tend to be parts of jargon-terms. There are also “morphological properties” that are
indicative of subsets of jargon-terms: allCap acronyms, chemical formulas, etc.
Our system classifies each word using POS tags, manually created dictionaries and the output of our
own topic-term system. These classifications are achieved in four stages. In the first stage we divide
the text into smaller segments using coordinate conjunctions (and, or, as well as, ...) and punctuation
(periods, left/right parentheses and brackets, quotation marks, commas, colons, semi-colons). These
segments are typically smaller than the level of the sentence, but larger than most noun groups. These
segments are good units to process because they are larger than jargon-terms (substrings of noun groups)
and smaller than sentences (and thus provide a smaller search space). In the second stage, potential
jargon-term (PJs) are generated by processing tokens from left to right and classifying them using a
finite state machine (FSM). The third stage filters the PJs generated with a set of manually constructed
constraints, yielding a set of jargon-terms. A final filter (stage 4) identifies named entities and separates
them out from the true jargon-terms: it turns out that many named entities have similar phrase-internal
properties as jargon-terms.
The FSM (that generates PJs) in the second stage includes the following states (Ramshaw and Marcus,
1995): START (S) (marking the beginning of a segment), Begin Term (B-T), Inside Term (I-T), End
Term (E-T), and Other (O). A PJ is a sequence consisting of: (a) a single E-T; or (b) exactly one B-T,
followed by zero or more instances of I-T, followed by zero or one instances of E-T. Each transition to
a new state is conditioned on: (a) the (extended) POS tag of the current word; (b) the extended POS
tag of the previous word; and (c) the previous state. The extended POSs are derived from the output of
a Penn-Treebank-based POS tagger and refinements based on machine readable dictionaries, including
COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., 1997), NOMLEX (Macleod et al., 1998), and some manually encoded
dictionaries created for this project. Table 1 describes the transitions in the FSM (unspecified entries
mean no restriction). ELSE indicates that in all cases other than those listed, the FST goes to state O.
Extended POS tags are classified as follows.
Adjectives, words with POS tags JJ, JJR or JJS, are subdivided into:
STAT-ADJ: Words in this class are marked adjective in our POS dictionaries and found as the first word
in one of the top ranked topic-terms (for the topic associated with the input document).
TECH-ADJ: If an adjective ends in a suffix indicating (-ic, -cous, -xous, and several others) it is a
technical word, but it is not found in our list of exceptions, it is marked TECH-ADJ.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.375679">
NAT-ADJ: An adjective, usually capitalized, that is the adjectival form of a country, state, city or conti-
nent, e.g., European, Indian, Peruvian, .. .
CAP-ADJ: An adjective such that the first letter is capitalized (but is not marked NAT-ADJ).
ADJ: Other adjectives
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.797294785714286">
Nouns are marked NN or NNS by the POS tagger and are the default POS for out of vocabulary (OOV)
words. POS tags like NNP, NNPS and FW (proper nouns and foreign nouns) are not reliable for our POS
tagger (trained on news) when applied to patents and technical articles. So NOUN is also assumed for
these. Subclasses include:
O-NOUN: (Singular or plural) nouns not found in any of our dictionaries (COMLEX plus some person
names) or nouns found in lists of specialized vocabulary which currently include chemical names.
PER-NOUN: Nouns beginning with a capital that are in our dictionary of first and last names.
PLUR-NOUN: Nouns with POS NNS nouns that are not marked O-NOUN or PER-NOUN.
C-NOUN: Nouns with POS NN that are not marked O-NOUN or PER-NOUN.
Verbs Only ING-VERBs (VBG) and ED-VERBs (VBN and VBD) are needed for this task (other
verbs trigger state O). Finally, we use the following additional POS tags:
POSS: POS for ’s, split off from a possessive noun.
PREP: All prepositions (POS IN and TO)
ROM-NUM: Roman numerals (I, II, ..., MMM)

A potential jargon-term (PJ) is an actual jargon-term unless it is filtered out as follows. First, a jargon
term J must meet all of these conditions:

1. J must contain at least one noun.
2. J must be more than one character long, not counting a final period.

4. J must not end in a common abbreviation from a list (e.g., cf., etc.)
5. J must not contain a word that violates a morphological filter, designed to rule out numeric identi-
fiers (patent numbers), mathematical formulas and other non-words. This rules out tokens beginning
with numbers that include letters; tokens including plus signs, ampersands, subscripts, superscripts;
tokens containing no alphanumeric characters at all, etc.
6. J must not contain a word that is a member of a list of common patent section headings.
Secondly, a jargon-term J must satisfy at least one of the following additional conditions:
1. J = highly ranked topic-term or a substring of J is a highly ranked topic-term.
2. J contains at least one O-NOUN.

A final stage aims to distinguish named entities from jargon-terms. It turns out that named entities, like
jargon terms, include many out of vocabulary words. Thus we look for NEs among those PJs that remain
after stage 3 and contain capitalized words (a single capital letter followed by lowercase letters). These
NE filters are based on manually collected lists of named entities and nationality adjectives, as well as
common NE endings. Dictionary lookup is used to assign GPE (ACE’s Geopolitical Entity) to New York
or American; LOC(ation) to Aegean Sea and Ural Mountains; and FAC(ility) to Panama Canal and Suez
Canal. Plurals of nationality words, e.g., Americans are filtered out as non-terms. PJs are filtered by
endings typically associated with non-terms, e.g., et al signals PJs as citations to articles and honorifics
(Esq, PhD, Jr, Snr) signal PER(son) named entities. Finally, if at least one of the words in a multi-word
term is a first or last person name, we can further filter them by endings, where ORGanization endings

include Agency, Association, College and more than 65 others; GPE endings include Heights, Township,
Park; LOC(ation) endings include Street, Avenue and Boulevard. It turns out that 2 word capitalized
structures including at least one person name are usually either ORG or GPE in our patent corpus, and
we maintain this ambiguity, but mark them as non-terms.
We have described a first implementation of a jargon-term chunker based on a combination of prin-
ciples previously implemented in noun group chunking and topic-term extraction systems. The chunker
can use essentially the same algorithms as previous noun group chunkers, though in this case we used
a manual-rule based FSM. The extended POSs are defined according to conventional POS (represent-
ing substitutability, morphology, etc.), statistical topic-term extraction, OOV status (absence from our
dictionary) or presence in specialized dictionaries (NOMLEX, dictionary of chemicals, etc.). We use
topic-term extraction to identify both particular noun sequences (high-ranked topic-terms) and some of
their components (STAT-ADJ), and could extend this strategy to other components, e.g., common head
nouns. We approximated the concept of “rare word” by noting which words were not found in our
standard dictionary (O-NOUN). As is well-known, “noun” and “adjective” are the first and second most
frequent POS for OOV words and both POSs are typically found as part of noun groups. Furthermore,
rare instances of O-NOUN (and OOV adjectives) are typically parts of jargon-terms. This approximation
is fine-tuned by the addition of word lists (e.g., chemicals). In future work, we can use more distribu-
tional information to fine-tune these categories, e.g., we can use topic-term techniques to identify single
topic words (nouns and adjectives) and experiment with these additional POS (instead of or in addition
to the current POS classes).

4 The Annotator Definition of Jargon-Term
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998761333333333">
For purposes of annotation, we defined jargon-term as a word or multi-word nominal expression that is
specific to some technical sublanguage. It need not be a proper noun, but it should be conventionalized
in one of the following two ways:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.917957">
1. The term is defined early (possibly by being abbreviated) in the document and used repeatedly
(possibly only in its abbreviated form).
2. The term is special to a particular field or subfield (not necessarily the field of the document being
annotated). It is not enough if the document contains a useful description of an object of interest
– there must be some conventional, definable term that can be used and reused. Thus multi-word
expressions that are defined as jargon terms must be somewhat word-like – mere descriptions that
are never reused verbatim are not jargon terms. (Justeson and Katz, 1995) goes further than we do:
they require that terms be reused within the document being annotated, whereas we only require
that they be reused (e.g., frequent hits in a web search).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996955857142857">
Criterion 2 leaves open the question of how specific to a genre an expression must be to be considered a
jargon-term. At an intuitive level, we would like to exclude words like patient, which occur frequently
in medical texts, but are also commonly found in non-expert, everyday language. By contrast, we would
like to include words like tumor and chromosome, which are more intrinsic to technical language insofar
as they have specialized definitions and subtypes within medical language. To clarify, we posited that a
jargon-term must be sufficiently specialized so that a typical naive adult should not be expected to know
the meaning of the term. We developed 2 alternative models of a naive adult:

<listItem confidence="0.9462656">
1. Homer Simpson, an animated TV character who caricatures the typical naive adult–the annotators

2. The Juvenile Fiction sub-corpus of the COCA: The annotators go to http://corpus.byu.
edu/coca/ and search under FIC:Juvenile – a single occurrence of an expression in this corpus
suggests that it is probably not a jargon-term.

extent rules on the definitions and the set of problematic examples that were discussed and cataloged
during that project. This essentially formed the annotation equivalent of case-law for extents. We will
make our annotation specifications available on-line, along with discussions of these cases.

5 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971909090909">
For evaluation purposes, we annotated all the instances of jargon-terms in a speech recognition patent
(SRP), a sunscreen patent (SUP) and an article about a virus vaccine (VVA). Each document was an-
notated by 2 people and then adjudicated by Annotator 2 after discussing controversial cases. Table 2
scores the system, annotator 1 and annotator 2, by comparing each against the answer key providing:
number of terms in the answer key, number of matches, precision, recall and F-measure. The “strict”
scores are based on exact matches between system terms and answer key terms, whereas the “sloppy”
scores count as correct instances where part of a system term matches part of an answer key term (span
errors). As the SRP document was annotated first, some of specification agreement process took place
after annotation and the scores for annotators are somewhat lower than for the other documents. How-
ever, Annotator 1’s scores for SUP and VVA are good approximations of how well a human being should
be expected to perform and the system’s scores should be compared to Annotator 1 (i.e., accounting for
the adjudicator’s bias).
There are 4 system results: two baseline systems and two stages of the system described in section 3.
Baseline 1 assumes terms derived by removing determiners from noun groups – we used an MEMM
chunker using features from the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003). That system has relatively high recall,
but overgenerates, yielding a lower precision and F-measure than our full system – it is also inaccurate
at determining the extent of terms. Baseline 2 restricts the noun groups from this same chunker to those
with O-NOUN heads. This improves the precision at a high cost to recall. Similarly, we first ran our
system without filtering the potential jargon-terms, and then we ran the full system. Clearly our more
complex strategy performs better than these baselines and the linguistic filters increase precision more
than they reduce recall, resulting in higher F-measures (though low-precision high-recall output may be
better for some applications).

6 Relations with Jargon-Terms
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907133333333">
(Meyers et al., 2014) describes the annotation of 200 PubMed articles from and 26 patents with several
relations, as well as a system for automatically extracting relations. It turned out that the automatic
system depended on the creation of a jargon-term extraction system and thus that work was the major
motivating factor for the research described here. Choosing topic-terms as potential arguments would
have resulted in low recall. In contrast, allowing any noun-group to be an argument would have lowered
precision, e.g., diagram, large number, accordance and first step are unlikely to be valid arguments of
relations. In the example: The resequencing pathogen microarrayA2 in the diagram is a promising new
technology., we can detect that the authors of the articles view pathogen microarray as significant, and
not the NG diagram. By selecting jargon-terms as potential arguments we are selecting the most probable
noun group arguments for our relations. For the current system (which does not use a parser), the system
performs best if non-jargon-terms are not considered as potential relation arguments at all. However, one
could imagine a wider coverage (and slower) system incorporating a preference for jargon-terms (like a
selection restriction) with dependency-based constraints.
We will only describe a few of these relations due to space considerations. Our relations include:
(1) ABBREVIATE, a relation between two terms that are equivalent. In the normal case, one term
is clearly a shorthand version of the other, e.g., “The D. melanogaster gene Muscle LIM protein at
84BA1 (abbreviated as Mlp84BA2)”. However, in the special case (ABBREVIATE:ALIAS) neither
term is a shorthand for the other. For example in “Silver behenateA1, also known as CH3-(CH2)20-
COOAgA2”, the chemical name establishes that this substance is a salt, whereas the formula provides
the proportions of all its constituent elements; (2) ORIGINATE, the relation between an ARG1 (person,
organization or document) and an ARG2 (a term), such that the ARG1 is an inventor, discoverer, manu-
facturer, or distributor of the ARG2 and some of these roles are differentiated as subtypes of the relation.
Examples include the following: “EagleA1’s minimum essential mediaA2 and DOPGA2 was obtained
from Avanti Polar LipidsA1”. (3) EXEMPLIFY, an IS-A relation (Hearst, 1992) between terms so
that ARG1 is an instance of ARG2, e.g., “CytokinesA2, for instance interferonA1”; and “proteinsA2
such as insulinA1”; (4) CONTRAST relations, e.g., “necrotrophic effector systemA1 that is an ex-
citing contrast to the biotrophic effector modelsA2”; (5) BETTER THAN relations, e.g., “Bayesian
networksA1 hold a considerable advantage over pairwise association testsA2”; and (6) SIGNIFICANT
relations, e.g., “Anaerobic SBsA2 are an emerging area of research and development” (ARG1, the author
of the article, is implicit). These relations are applicable to most technical genres.

7 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976777777778">
We have described a method for extracting instances of jargon-terms with an F-measure of between
62% and 77% (strict vs sloppy), about 73% to 84% of human performance. We expect this work to
facilitate the extraction of a wide reange of relations from technical documents. Previous work has
focused on generating topic-terminology or term types, extracted over sets of documents. In contrast, we
describe an effective method of extracting term tokens, which represent a larger percent of the instances
of terminology in documents and constitute arguments of many more potential relations. Our work on
relation extraction yielded very low recalls until we adopted this methodology. Consequently, we have
obtained recall of over 50% for many relations (with precision ranging from 70% for OPINION relations
like Significant to 96% for Originate.).

The resulting system admits not only topic-terms, but also other non-topic instances of terminology. Using the more inclusive set of jargon-terms (rather than just topic-terms) as arguments of the IE relations in section 6, we are able to detect a larger and more informative set of relation. Furthermore, these relations are salient for a wide variety of genres (unlike those in (BioCreAtIvE, 2006)) – a genre-neutral definition of terminology makes this possible. For example, the CONTRAST relation between the two bold face terms in necrotrophic effector systemA1 that is an exciting contrast to the biotrophic effector modelsA2. would be applicable in most academic genres. Our jargon-terms also contrast with the tactic of filling terminology slots in relations with any noun-group (Justeson and Katz, 1995), as such a strategy overgenerates, lowering precision. 2 Topic-term Extraction Topic-term extractors (Velardi et al., 2001; Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003) collect candidate terms (N-grams, no</context>

Ignoring the potato type cases, topic-terms are a proper subset of jargon-terms and, thus, the set of jargon-terms is larger than the set of topic-terms. Finally, topic terms are ranked with respect to how well they can serve as keywords, i.e., how specific they are to a particular document set, whereas +/-jargon-term is a binary distinction. We built a topic term extractor that combines several metrics together in an ensemble including: TFIDF, KL Divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991; Hisamitsu et al., 1999) and a combination of Domain Relevance and Document Consensus (DRDC) based on (Navigli and Velardi, 2004). Furthermore, we filtered the output by requiring that each term would be recognized as a term by the jargon-term chunker described below in section 3. We manually scored the top 100 terms generated for two classes of biology patents (US patent classes 435 and 436) and achieved accuracies of 85% and 76% respectively. We also manually evaluated the top 100 terms taken from biology articles, yielding an accuracy of about 88%. As discussed, we use the output of this s</context>

In fact, due to both the amount of repetition in patents and the presence of multiple types of terminology (legal terms as well as topic-related terms), it is hard to imagine that eliminating terms occurring below a frequency threshold (as with (Justeson and Katz, 1995)) would be an effective method of filtering.

Finally, topic terms are ranked with respect to how well they can serve as keywords, i.e., how specific they are to a particular document set, whereas +/-jargon-term is a binary distinction. We built a topic term extractor that combines several metrics together in an ensemble including: TFIDF, KL Divergence (Cover and Thomas, 1991; Hisamitsu et al., 1999) and a combination of Domain Relevance and Document Consensus (DRDC) based on (Navigli and Velardi, 2004).

We describe a chunkingbased approach, an evaluation, and applications to non-topic-specific relation extraction. 1 Introduction Webster’s II New College Dictionary (Houghton Mifflin Company, 2001, p.1138) defines terminology as: The vocabulary of technical terms and usages appropriate to a particular field, subject, science, or art. Systems for automatically extracting instances of terminology (terms) usually assume narrow operational definitions that are compatible with particular tasks. Terminology, in the context of Information Retrieval (IR) (Jacquemin and Bourigault, 2003) refers to keyword search terms (microarray, potato, genetic algorithm), single or multi-word (mostly nominal) expressions collectively representing topics of documents that contain them. These same terms are also used for creating domain-specific thesauri and ontologies (Velardi et al., 2001). We will refer to these types of terms as topic-terms and this type of terminology topic-terminology. In other work, types of terminology (genes, chemical names, biological processes, etc.) are defined relative to a specific field like Chemistry or Biology (Kim et al., 2003; Corbett et al., 2007; Bada et</context>

In other work, types of terminology (genes, chemical names, biological processes, etc.) are defined relative to a specific field like Chemistry or Biology (Kim et al., 2003; Corbett et al., 2007; Bada et al., 2010). These classes are used for narrow tasks, e.g., Information Extraction (IE) slot filling tasks within a particular genre of interest (Giuliano et al., 2006; Bundschus et al., 2008; BioCreAtIvE, 2006). Other projects are limited to Information Extraction tasks that may not be terminology-specific, but have terms as arguments, e.g., (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Jin et al., 2013) detect abbreviation and definition relations respectively and the arguments are terms. In contrast to this previous work, we have built a system that extracts a larger set of terminology, which we call jargon-terminology. Jargon-terms may include ultracentrifuge, which is unlikely to be a topic-term of a current biology article, but will not include potato, a non-technical word that could be a valid topic-term. We aim to find all the jargon-terms found in a text, not just the ones that fill slots for specific relations. As we show, jargon-terminology closely matches the notional (e.g., Webste</context>

Furthermore, these relations are salient for a wide variety of genres (unlike those in (BioCreAtIvE, 2006)) – a genre-neutral definition of terminology makes this possible. For example, the CONTRAST relation between the two bold face terms in necrotrophic effector systemA1 that is an exciting contrast to the biotrophic effector modelsA2. would be applicable in most academic genres. Our jargon-terms also contrast with the tactic of filling terminology slots in relations with any noun-group (Justeson and Katz, 1995), as such a strategy overgenerates, lowering precision. 2 Topic-term Extraction Topic-term extractors (Velardi et al., 2001; Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003) collect candidate terms (N-grams, noun groups, words) that are more representative of a foreground corpus (documents about a specific topic) than they are of a background corpus (documents about a wide range of topics), using statistical measures such as Term Frequency (TFIDF), or a variation thereof. Due to the metrics used Inverse Document Frequency and cutoffs assumed, the list of terms selected is usually no more than a few hundred distinct </context>

Furthermore, we filtered the output by requiring that each term would be recognized as a term by the jargon-term chunker described below in section 3. We manually scored the top 100 terms generated for two classes of biology patents (US patent classes 435 and 436) and achieved accuracies of 85% and 76% respectively. We also manually evaluated the top 100 terms taken from biology articles, yielding an accuracy of about 88%. As discussed, we use the output of this system for our jargon-term extraction system. 3 Jargon-term Extraction by Chunking (Justeson and Katz, 1995) uses manual rules to detect noun groups (sequences of nouns and adjectives ending in a noun) with the goal of detecting instances of topic-terms. They filter out those noun groups that occur only once in the document on the theory that the multiply used noun groups are more likely to be topics. They manually score their output from two computer science articles and one biotechnology article, with 146, 350 and 834 instances of terms and achieve accuracies of 96%, 86% and 77%. (Frantzi et al., 2000) uses linguistic rules similar to noun chunking to detect candidate terms; filters the results us</context>

As we aim to find all instances of jargon-terms, we evaluate for both precision and recall rather than just accuracy (section 5). Two of the documents that we test on are patents, which have a very different word distribution than articles. In fact, due to both the amount of repetition in patents and the presence of multiple types of terminology (legal terms as well as topic-related terms), it is hard to imagine that eliminating terms occurring below a frequency threshold (as with (Justeson and Katz, 1995)) would be an effective method of filtering. Furthermore, (Frank, 2000) used a very different corpus than we did and they focused on a slightly different problem (e.g., we did not attempt to find the highest-ranked terms and we did not attempt to find both long terms and substrings which were terms). Thus while it is appropriate to compare our methodology, it is difficult to compare our results. We have implemented a hand-crafted term extractor, which we will call a jargon-term chunker because it functions in much the same way as a noun group chunker. It uses a deterministic finite state machi</context>

The term is defined early (possibly by being abbreviated) in the document and used repeatedly (possibly only in its abbreviated form). 2. The term is special to a particular field or subfield (not necessarily the field of the document being annotated). It is not enough if the document contains a useful description of an object of interest – there must be some conventional, definable term that can be used and reused. Thus multi-word expressions that are defined as jargon terms must be somewhat word-like – mere descriptions that are never reused verbatim are not jargon terms. (Justeson and Katz, 1995) goes further than we do: they require that terms be reused within the document being annotated, whereas we only require that they be reused (e.g., frequent hits in a web search). Criterion 2 leaves open the question of how specific to a genre an expression must be to be considered a jargon-term. At an intuitive level, we would like to exclude words like patient, which occur frequently in medical texts, but are also commonly found in non-expert, everyday language. By contrast, we would like to include words like tumor and chromosome, which are more intrinsic to technical language insofar as th</context>

However, Annotator 1’s scores for SUP and VVA are good approximations of how well a human being should be expected to perform and the system’s scores should be compared to Annotator 1 (i.e., accounting for the adjudicator’s bias). There are 4 system results: two baseline systems and two stages of the system described in section 3. Baseline 1 assumes terms derived by removing determiners from noun groups – we used an MEMM chunker using features from the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003). That system has relatively high recall, but overgenerates, yielding a lower precision and F-measure than our full system – it is also inaccurate at determining the extent of terms. Baseline 2 restricts the noun groups from this same chunker to those with O-NOUN heads. This improves the precision at a high cost to recall. Similarly, we first ran our system without filtering the potential jargon-terms, and then we ran the full system.

In the second stage, potential jargon-term (PJs) are generated by processing tokens from left to right and classifying them using a finite state machine (FSM). The third stage filters the PJs generated with a set of manually constructed constraints, yielding a set of jargon-terms. A final filter (stage 4) identifies named entities and separates them out from the true jargon-terms: it turns out that many named entities have similar phrase-internal properties as jargon-terms. The FSM (that generates PJs) in the second stage includes the following states (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): START (S) (marking the beginning of a segment), Begin Term (B-T), Inside Term (I-T), End Term (E-T), and Other (O). A PJ is a sequence consisting of: (a) a single E-T; or (b) exactly one B-T, followed by zero or more instances of I-T, followed by zero or one instances of E-T. Each transition to a new state is conditioned on: (a) the (extended) POS tag of the current word; (b) the extended POS tag of the previous word; and (c) the previous state. The extended POSs are derived from the output of a Penn-Treebank-based POS tagger and refinements based on machine readable dictionaries, including </context>

In other work, types of terminology (genes, chemical names, biological processes, etc.) are defined relative to a specific field like Chemistry or Biology (Kim et al., 2003; Corbett et al., 2007; Bada et al., 2010). These classes are used for narrow tasks, e.g., Information Extraction (IE) slot filling tasks within a particular genre of interest (Giuliano et al., 2006; Bundschus et al., 2008; BioCreAtIvE, 2006). Other projects are limited to Information Extraction tasks that may not be terminology-specific, but have terms as arguments, e.g., (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Jin et al., 2013) detect abbreviation and definition relations respectively and the arguments are terms. In contrast to this previous work, we have built a system that extracts a larger set of terminology, which we call jargon-terminology. Jargon-terms may include ultracentrifuge, which is unlikely to be a topic-term of a current biology article, but will not include potato, a non-technical word that could be a valid topic-term. We aim to find all the jargon-terms found in a text, not just the ones that fill slots for specific relations. As we show, jargon-terminology closely matches the not</context>

Systems for automatically extracting instances of terminology (terms) usually assume narrow operational definitions that are compatible with particular tasks. Terminology, in the context of Information Retrieval (IR) (Jacquemin and Bourigault, 2003) refers to keyword search terms (microarray, potato, genetic algorithm), single or multi-word (mostly nominal) expressions collectively representing topics of documents that contain them. These same terms are also used for creating domain-specific thesauri and ontologies (Velardi et al., 2001). We will refer to these types of terms as topic-terms and this type of terminology topic-terminology.

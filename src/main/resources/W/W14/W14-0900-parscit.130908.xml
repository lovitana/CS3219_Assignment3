Welcome to the third edition of the workshop on Computational Linguistics for Literature. What started
out two years ago as a small affair with an unorthodox title seems to be shaping into a modestly sized
but vibrant research community.
Thanks to the effort of the authors and the program committee, April 27, 2014 promises to be an
interesting day.
This year’s workshop boasts the rich pickings of papers focussed on creating character representations
from text and on applications of such representations. Agarwal et al. present a system for extracting
social networks from movie scripts. Coll Ardanuy and Sporleder propose a method of finding similar
novels using social networks as the underlying representation. Bullard and Alm work on identifying
social information about characters from dialogues in a corpus of plays. Taking this a step further, Iosif
and Mishra describe an integrated system for identifying and classifying characters in children’s stories
based on direct and indirect speech.
Taking a complementary point of view, the position paper by Levison and Lessard builds upon their
previous work and proposes a graph-based representation for the temporal structure of narratives. The
paper by Zemánek and Miliˇcka describes a diachronic study of Arabic literature, tracing the influence of
certain treatises across centuries.
In the categories all of their own are two more papers. Davis and Mohammad break new ground with a
paper on generating music from literature; you can listen to a one-minute musical summary of a novel.
Mike Kestemont presents a position paper on authorship attribution, a topic which was quite popular in
the 2012 and 2013 editions of the workshop.
Last but by no means least, we are delighted to have two invited speakers this year. An artist and
researcher María Mencía from Kingston University in London will talk about electronic poetry. Jan
Christoph Meister from University of Hamburg will tell us about the connections between narratology
and computation.
We look forward to seeing you in Göteborg.

María Mencía is an artist-researcher and Senior Lecturer in New Media Theory and Digital
Media Practice in the School of Performance and Screen Studies at Kingston University,
UK. She holds a PhD in Digital Poetics and Digital Art by the University of the Arts,
London. She studied English Philology at the Complutense University in Madrid, Fine
Art and History and Theory of Art at the University of the Arts London.
Mencía’s practice-based research in language, art and technology draws from different cul-
tural, social, artistic and literary traditions such as: linguistics, fine art, film, visual, con-
crete and sound poetry, with digital poetics, electronic writing, and new media art theories
and practices. Her practice includes interactive installations, performances, net.art, sound-
generated poems and interactive generative narratives.

As an academic and an artist my practice-based research is at the intersection of language, art and digital
technology. It explores the area of the in-between, the visual, the aural and the semantic. I am always
interested in experimenting with the digital medium with the aim of engaging the reader/viewer/user in
an experience of shifting ‘in’ and ‘out’ of language. This involves looking ‘at’ and looking ‘through’
transparent and abstract textualities and linguistic soundscapes. It draws from avant-garde poetics re-
mediating concepts of reading and writing, exploring digital media grammars (voice activation, use of
webcam, use of mouse, acts of revealing, triggering, cut and paste, dragging) for interactivity, aesthetics,
engagement and meaning production. It is trans-disciplinary, bringing together different cultural, artistic
and literary traditions such as: linguistics, fine art, visual, concrete and sound poetry, with digital poetics,
electronic writing, and new media art theories and practices.

The Digital Humanities are undoubtedly en vogue. Hardly any of the Humanities can nowadays ig-
nore this methodological paradigm which affords us with vast resources of openly accessible digitized
source material ranging from texts to multimedia files to 3D representations of material artifacts; with a
plethora of digital research tools to explore and manipulate these primary resources; with virtual research
environments that allow us to collaborate in real time across time and space; with exciting new forms of
research publication and dissemination; and finally with big data approaches that have begun to balance
the historically and qualitative oriented speculative concerns of the traditional Humanities with the more
empirically oriented, descriptive research procedures of the Social Sciences.
To those who championed what was initially called ‘Humanities Computing’ since the late 1980s this
development is of course rewarding. However, DH is not the first empiricist methodological paradigm
whose advent the Humanities have witnessed during the latter part of the 20th century. Artificial Intelli-
gence and Linguistics, to mention but two, also had their heyday – and in the 1970s many of us believed
that these were to become the new master disciplines that would revolutionize the Humanities at large.
It just didn’t happen: Linguistics ranks as an equal again while AI has all but disappeared. DH, too, will
experience its life cycle, and my personal prediction is that in ten years’ time the term in its narrower
sense of ‘digital research methods in the humanities’ will have become obsolete precisely because DH
practices will by then have become business as usual for everyone.
Indeed, I think that there is something that is significantly more important than to engage in any such
speculation about the future development of DH. One aspect that this methodological paradigm still lacks
is a sufficiently developed critique of its own philosophical and epistemological fundamentals. If I were
an opponent of DH this is the weak spot that I would attack relentlessly: how can a practice, a method,
let alone a discipline that shies away from methodological self-reflection claim to be ‘humanistic’?
Against this backdrop I would like to present some ideas on what I term the “DH-paradox”: the in-
herent tension and, perhaps, even contradiction between the hermeneutic quest for holistic meaning (the
German Sinn) - which, in Fregian terms, denotes more than just symbolic ‘reference’, but rather the cou-
pling of reference and existential relevance that characterizes human symbolic systems and interactions
– and the conceptual fundamental of the digital: the idea and premise that, whatever we want to study
can be broken down into discrete, measurable atomic observations. The big and fascinating challenge
for DH and for the Humanities, I believe, is how we can make this tension between the holistic and the
atomic, the synthetic human experience and the analytic formalism of abstraction become productive
from a Humanists perspective.

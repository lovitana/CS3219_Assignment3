Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999940869565217">
When code switching, individuals incor-
porate elements of multiple languages into
the same utterance. While code switching
has been studied extensively in formal and
spoken contexts, its behavior and preva-
lence remains unexamined in many newer
forms of electronic communication. The
present study examines code switching in
Twitter, focusing on instances where an
author writes a post in one language and
then includes a hashtag in a second lan-
guage. In the first experiment, we per-
form a large scale analysis on the lan-
guages used in millions of posts to show
that authors readily incorporate hashtags
from other languages, and in a manual
analysis of a subset the hashtags, reveal
prolific code switching, with code switch-
ing occurring for some hashtags in over
twenty languages. In the second experi-
ment, French and English posts from three
bilingual cities are analyzed for their code
switching frequency and its content.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999780685714286">
Online platforms enable individuals from a wide
variety of linguistic backgrounds to communi-
cate. When individuals share multiple languages
in common, their communication will occasion-
ally include linguistic elements from multiple lan-
guages (Nilep, 2006), a practice commonly re-
ferred to as code switching. Typically, during code
switching, the text or speech in a language retains
its syntactic and morphological constraints for that
language, rather than having text from both lan-
guages conform to one of the language’s grammat-
ical rules. This requirement enables code switch-
ing to be separated from borrowing, where foreign
words are integrated into a native language’s lexi-
con and morphology (Gumperz, 1982; Poplack et
al., 1988; Sankoff et al., 1990).
While work on code switching began with con-
versational analyses, recent work has examined
the phenomena in electronic communication, find-
ing similar evidence of code switching (Climent
et al., 2003; Lee, 2007; Paolillo, 2011). How-
ever, these investigations into code switching have
largely examined interpersonal communication or
settings where the number of participants is lim-
ited. In contrast, social media platforms such as
Twitter offer individuals the ability to write a text
that is decoupled from direct conversation but may
be read widely.
Twitter enables users to post messages with spe-
cial markers known as hashtags, which can serve
as a side channel to comment on the post itself
(Davidov et al., 2010). As a result, multilingual
authors have embraced using hashtags from lan-
guages other than the language of their post. Con-
sider the following real examples:

on sleep and school, respectively, and then each
use hashtags with similar meanings in both their
native language and English.
Hashtags provide authors with a communica-
tion medium that also has broader social utility
by embedding their post within global discussion
of other posts using the same hashtag (Letierce et
al., 2010) or by becoming a part of a virtual com-
munity (Gupta et al., 2010). These social motiva-
tions resemble those seen for why individuals may
code switch, such as to assimilate into a group or
make discussions easier (Urciuoli, 1995). Twit-
ter and other hashtag-supporting platforms such as
Instagram and Facebook offer a unique setting for
code switching hashtags for two reasons: (1) po-
tential readers are disconnected from the author,
who may not know of their language fluency, and
(2) text translation is built into the platform, which
enables readers to translate a post into their na-
tive language. As such, authors may be motivated
to include a hashtag of another language to in-
crease their potential audience size or to appear as
a member of a multilingual virtual community.
Despite the prevalence of non-English tweets,
which are approaching 50% of the total volume
(Liu et al., 2014), no study has examined the
prevalence of hashtag code switching. We pro-
pose an initial study of hashtag code switching in
Twitter focusing on three central questions: (1)
for which language pairs do authors write in the
first language and then incorporate a hashtag of
the second language, (2) when tweets include a
hashtag of a different language, which instances
signal code switching behavior, and (3) the degree
to which bilingual populations code switch hash-
tags. Here, we adopt a general definition of code
switching as instances where an individual estab-
lishes a linguistic context in one language and
then includes elements (such as words) from one
or more other languages different from the first.
Two experiments are performed to answer these
questions. In the first, we test general methods to
identify which languages adopt the same hashtags
and whether those shared hashtags are examples of
code switching. In the second, we focus on three
bilingual cities to examine hashtag code switching
behavior in French and English speakers.
Our study provides three main contributions.
First, we demonstrate that hashtag code switching
is widespread in Twitter. Second, we show that
Twitter as a platform includes multiple phenom-
ena that can be falsely interpreted as code switch-
ing and therefore must be accounted for in future
analyses. Third, in a study of French and English
tweets from three cities, we find that an increased
rate of bilinguality decreases the frequency of in-
cluding hashtags from another language but in-
creases the overall rate of code switching when
such hashtags are present. Furthermore, all data
for the experiments is made publicly available.

<bodyText confidence="0.999648138888889">
Research on code switching is long standing, with
many theories proposed for the motivations be-
hind code switching and how the two languages
interact linguistically (Poplack and Sankoff, 1984;
Myers-Scotton, 1997; Auer, 1998). Most related
to the present work are those studies examining
code switching in online communications.
Climent et al. (2003) examined the use of Span-
ish and Catalan in newsgroups, finding it occurs
2.2% and 4.4% of the Catalan and Spanish con-
texts, respectively. Lee (2007) analyzed a cor-
pus of Cantonese and English emails and ICQ
instant messages and surveyed Hong Kong users
of each form of communication. She found that
the users preferred mixed-language communica-
tion, with no user indicating that they communi-
cated in only Cantonese. Furthermore, the shorter,
more informal ICQ messages were more likely to
be code switched (99.4%) than emails (41.3%).
Paolillo (2011) measured code switching
amongs English, Hindi, and Punjabi in both
IRC and Usenet forum posts, finding similar
to Climent et al. (2003) that the shorter, more
conversational IRC posts had higher rates of
code switching. Paolillo (2011) also note that
code switching rates differed between Hindi and
Punjabi speakers.
The present work differs significantly from
these three studies in two aspects. First, we as-
sess code switching across all language commu-
nities on Twitter, rather than examining individual
groups of bilingual speakers. Second, we focus
our analysis only on the code switching of a post’s
hashtag due to its unique role in microtext (Gupta
et al., 2010), which has yet to be examined in this
context.

a dual role as (1) bookmarking content with the
tag’s particular expression and (2) functioning as a
method for ad hoc community formation and dis-
cussion around a tag’s topic (Gupta et al., 2010;
Davidov et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012). However,
the diverse user base of the Twitter platform has
given rise to additional roles for hashtags beyond
these two. For example, many popular hashtags
focus on promoting users to follow each other,1
such as #followback and #openfollow. Similarly,
contests are run on Twitter, which have individu-
als vote by posting using a specific hashtag, e.g.,
#MtvHottest.
Given hashtags’ flexible roles, some may be
used in multiple languages without being exam-
ples of code switching, such as the contest-based
or follower-promotion hashtags noted above.
Therefore, we first propose a taxonomy for clas-
sifying all types of hashtags according to their pri-
mary observed use in order to disentangle poten-
tial code switching behavior from Twitter-specific
behavior. To construct the taxonomy, two an-
notators independently reviewed several thousand
hashtags of different frequency to assess the dif-
ferences in how the tag was used in practice. Each
annotator then proposed their own taxonomy. The
final taxonomy was produced from a discussion of
differences, with both annotators initially propos-
ing highly similar taxonomies.2

Table 1 shows the proposed taxonomy, contain-
ing eight broad types of hashtags. The first two
types of hashtags correspond to the main hash-
tag roles proposed in Yang et al. (2012). The
NAMED ENTITY tags also serve as method for
individuals to link their content with a specific
audience like the COMMUNITY type; however,
NAMED ENTITY tags were treated as a separate
group for the purposes of this study because the
entities typically have a common name which is
used in all languages and therefore would not be
translated; in contrast, COMMUNITY hashtags re-
fer to more general topics such as #soccer, which
may be translated, e.g., #futbol. Hashtags of the
five remaining types would likely not be observed
in instances of code switching, with such hash-
tags often being used for purposes other than inter-
personal communication.

<bodyText confidence="0.999984486486487">
Data Hashtag frequencies were calculated from
981M tweets spanning March 2014 to July 2014.
Frequencies were calculated over this five month
period in order to focus on widely-used hashtags,
rather than bursty hashtags that are popular only
for a short time, such as those studied in Huang
et al. (2010) and Lin et al. (2013). For each hash-
tag, up to 10K non-retweet posts containing that
hashtag were retained, randomly sampling from
the time period studied when more than 10K were
observed. To enable a more reliable estimate of
the language distribution, we restrict our analysis
to only those hashtags with more than 1000 posts,
for a total number of 19.4M posts for 4624 hash-
tags, with an average of 4204 posts per hashtag.
Language Identification The languages of
tweets were identified using a two-step procedure.
First, message content was filtered to remove con-
tent such as usernames, URLs, emoji, and hash-
tags. Tweets with fewer than three remaining to-
kens were excluded (e.g., a message with only
hashtags). Second, the remaining content was
processed using langid.py (Lui and Baldwin,
2012), a state of the art language identification
program that supports the diversity of languages
found on Twitter.
Determining the language of a hashtag in a gen-
eral setting for all languages is difficult due to the
presence of acronyms, abbreviations, and slang.
Therefore, we adopt a heuristic where a hashtag’s
language is set as the language used by the major-
ity of its tweets. To quantify the accuracy of this
heuristic, two annotators inspected the tweets of
200 hashtags to identify the language of the hash-
tag and for the majority of the tweets. This anal-
ysis showed that the heuristic correctly identifies
the hashtag’s language in 96.5% of the instances.

most common after English.

ble 2 an overestimate of hashtag adoption by lan-
guages other than the hashtag’s source language.
A further inspection of language classification er-
rors revealed four common factors: (1) the lack of
accents on characters,3 (2) the use of short words,
which appeared ambiguous to langid.py, (3)
the use of non-Latin characters for emoticons or
visual affect, and (4) proper names originating
from a language different from the tweet’s. Never-
theless, the observed trends do provide some guid-
ance as to which language pairs might share hash-
tags and also may code switch.
Among the hashtags in Table 3, two are legit-
imately used by authors in multiple languages:
#soccer and #GER, the latter corresponding to the
German soccer team. Both hashtags were popular
due to the World Cup, which occurred during the
time period studied. For both, authors included
these hashtags while taking part in a global con-
versation about the games and event. The hashtag
#soccer is a clear case of code switching, where
individuals are communicating their interests in
multiple languages, even when equivalent hash-
tags in the tweet’s language are actively being
used. Indeed, over half of the languages using
#football had at least one tweet containing both
#football and #futbol. The example of #GER high-
lights a boundary case of code switching. Here,
GER is an abbreviation for the country’s name,

likely to be used in instances of code switching.
Performing such an analysis at scale would re-

types and cases of code switching among the
COMMUNITY and ANNOTATION hashtags. Two

were largely due to mistaken assignments rather

lowing, we describe the results of the analysis and
then highlight several types of hashtags.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of hashtag types
observed in the three samples. SPAM and AP-
PLICATION hashtags were most common among
highest frequency hashtags, whereas the low-
est frequency tags in the dataset were also ei-
ther SPAM or VOTING. Surprisingly, the me-
dian frequency hashtags had the majority of the
discussion-related hashtag types
Within the ANNOTATION and COMMUNITY
types, we selected thirteen hashtags each to man-
ually evaluate if code switching behavior was ob-
served. For each hashtag, two annotators reviewed
all associated tweets that were identified as using
a different language than that of the hashtag. An-
notators were instructed to consider the tweet an
instance of code switching only in cases where
(1) there was sufficient text to determine the mes-
sage’s actual language and (2) the message was an
act of communication (in contrast to spam-like or
nonsensical messages).
Code switching behavior was observed for
eleven of the ANNOTATION hashtags and twelve
of the COMMUNITY hashtags. Table 4 shows
those code switched hashtags and the languages
in which they were seen, highlighting the varying
frequency with which hashtags were used in multi-
ple languages. For example, the primarily Arabic
hashtag #Hadith was used in English and Dutch
tweets; similarity, all three Spanish hashtags were
used in English tweets.
Many hashtags are used primarily with lan-
guages that are associated with countries known

to have bilingual speakers fluent in English. How-
ever, several hashtags were used in a variety of
diverse languages. For example, #truth was used
with languages such as Arabic, Bosnian, Bulgar-
ian Hindi, and Punjabi. The most widely code
switched hashtag was #magic. In English, the
hashtag is commonly used with content on magic
tricks; however, in other languages, the hashtag
often connotes surprise. For example, the Lat-
vian tweet “Es izmekl¯eju visu plauktu, nekur nav.
Mamma piejiet ne sekunde nepag¯aja, kad vin¸a
atrada. #magic” comments on having an item on
the shelf disappear when looking for it, only for it
to reappear like magic.
During annotation, we observed that authors
were highly productive in their code switching, us-
ing these hashtags to generate the types of emo-
tional and sarcastic messages typically seen in
same-language messages. For example, in the
Swedish tweet “Bussen luktar spya och ¨ol. #fresh”
the author is sarcastically commenting on a bus

<bodyText confidence="0.999978372881356">
The process of annotating code switching for
hashtags revealed four notable trends in author be-
havior that occurred with multiple hashtags. First,
authors fluent in non-Latin writing systems will
often use Latin-transliterated hashtags, which are
then adopted by authors of Latin-based systems.
For example, the hashtag #aikatsu describes a col-
lectible card game and anime and is heavily used
by both Japanese and English authors. Similar-
ity, the transliterated hashtags #Hadith and #Quran
are commonly associated with Arabic-language
tweets, which rarely include an Arabic-script ver-
sion of those hashtags even when the tweets in-
clude other hashtags in Arabic.
Second, when two or more languages share the
same written form of a word (i.e., homographs),
the resulting hashtags become conflated and ap-
pear as false examples of code switching. For ex-
ample, #Real was widely used in both English and
Spanish, but with two meanings: the English us-
ages denoting something existent (i.e., not fake)
and the Spanish usages referring to Real Madrid
FC, a soccer club. The hashtag #cine also posed
a challenge due to abbreviation. While many
Spanish-language tweets include #cine (cinema),
tweets in other languages include #cinema and its
abbreviated form #cine, which matches the Span-
ish term, creating false evidence of code switch-
ing.
Third, multilingual individuals may adopt a
common hashtag for reasons other than code
switching, which we highlight with two examples.
The hashtag #1DWelcomeToBrazil is used in a
large number of English and Portuguese tweets.
This hashtag is associated with the travel arrival
of the English-speaking band One Direction to
Brazil. Similarly, the #100happydays hashtag was
spawned from a movement where individuals de-
scribe positive aspects of their day. These global
phenomena increases the difficulty of automati-
cally identifying code switching instances.
Fourth, spam accounts will occasionally latch
onto a hashtag and use it in a variety of languages.
For example, the popular hashtag #1000ADAY is
used to attract new followers, which resulted in
adult content services also using the hashtag to
post spam advertisements. Surprisingly, nearly
a third of tweets for this hashtag are in Russian
and feature fully-grammatical text that appears to
be randomly sampled from other sources, such as
lists of proverbs. After examining multiple ac-
counts, we speculate that these messages are actu-
ally bot accounts who need to generate sufficient
number of messages to avoid Twitter’s spam fil-
ters. Work on detecting fake accounts has largely
been done in English (Benevenuto et al., 2010;
Grier et al., 2010; Ghosh et al., 2012) and so may
benefit from detecting this cross-lingual hashtag
use in accounts.

5 Experiment 2: Bilingual Cities
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999965">
The second experiment measures the prevalence
of hashtag code switching in tweets from three
cities with different populations of English and
French speakers: Montreal, Canada, Quebec City,
Canada and Paris, France. All three cities are
known to contain bilingual speaker as well, who
have been shown to actively code switch (Heller,
1992). To test for differences in the code switch-
ing behavior of populations, each city is analyzed
according to the degree to which Anglophone
and Francophone speakers incorporate hashtags
of other languages into their tweets and whether
translations of the code switched hashtags are used
in the original language.

5.1 Experimental Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998391238095238">
Data Tweets were gathered for each city by us-
ing the method of Jurgens (2013) to identify Twit-
ter users with a home location within each city’s
greater metropolitan area. Tweets were then ex-
tracted for these users over a three year sample of
10% of Twitter. This process yielded 4.4M tweets
for Montreal, 203K for Quebec City, and 58.1M
for Paris. For efficiency, we restricted the Paris
dataset to 5M tweets, randomly sampled across the
time period.
Language Identification The language of a
tweet was identified using a similar process as in
Experiment 1. Because this setting restricts the
analysis to only English and French, a different
method was used to determine the language of a
hashtag. Given a tweet in language li, the text of
a hashtag is tested to see if it wholly occurs within
the dictionary for li; if not, a greedy tokenization
algorithm is run to attempt to split a hashtag into
constituent words that are in the dictionary of li. If

l1 or l2, it is assumed to be in the language of its
tweet. The aspell dictionaries were used to rec-
ognize words. Furthermore, after analyzing the er-
rors made due to missing words, dictionaries were
augmented to include common social media terms
in each language (e.g., “selfie”). A manual anal-
ysis of 100 hashtags each for French and English
showed that this language assignment method was
correct for 91% of the instances.

5.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998837254902">
Francophone authors were much more likely to
use English hashtags than Anglophone authors
were for French hashtags. For tweets in each lo-
cale and language, Figure 2 shows the percentage
containing a hashtag in the other language relative
to the total number in that city using a hashtag in
either language. Notably, Paris has a higher rate of
using English hashtags than both Canadian cities.
We speculate that this difference is due to the high
rate of bilingualism in Montreal and Quebec City;
because authors are fully fluent in both languages,
should Francophone authors need to express them-
selves with an English hashtag, they may write the
entire tweet in English, rather than code switch-
ing. In contrast, Parisian authors are less likely to
be fully fluent in English (though functional) and
therefore express themselves primarily in French
with English hashtags as desired. An analogous
trend may be seen for French hashtags in the En-
glish tweets from Montreal, which has a higher
population of primarily Anglophone speakers who
might be less willing to communicate entirely in
French but will still use French hashtags to con-
nect their content with the dominant language used
in the city.
For each language and city, Table 5 shows
the ten most popular hashtags incorporated into
tweets of the other language. Examining the most
popular English tags in French tweets shows a
clear distinction in the two populations; French
Parisian tweets include more universal English
hashtags or those generated by applications, which
are not generally instances of code switching. In
contrast, the Canadian cities include more AN-
NOTATION type hashtags, including the sarcasm-
marking #not, which are more indicative of code
switching behavior.
An established linguistic convention within a
population can also motivate authors to prefer
one language’s expression over another (Myers-
Scotton, 1997). To test whether a high-frequency
concept was equally expressed in French and En-
glish or whether one language’s expression was
preferred, we created pairs of equivalent English
and French hashtags expressing the same con-
cept (e.g., #happy/#heureux) by translating the
50 most-popular English hashtags used in French
tweets. Then, the tweets for each city were an-
alyzed to identify which languages were used in
expressing each concept as a hashtag. The results
in Figure 3 reveal that for nearly half of the hash-

tags, equivalent French language versions are in
use; however, examining the relative frequencies
shows that in all cases, the English version is still
preferred, despite the presence of a large Franco-
phone population. For hashtags that were only
seen in English, many were of the COMMUNITY
type, e.g., #50factsaboutme, which may not have
an equivalent French-language version. However,
we observed that when both an English hashtag
and its French translation were attested, the use
of the English hashtag in French was most often
an instance of code switching. Hence, testing for
the presence hashtag translation pairs may serve as
a helpful heuristic for identifying hashtags whose
use signals code switching behavior.

Typically, code switching is distinguished from
the related phenomena of borrowing by testing
whether the word is being fluently mixed into
the utterance instead of simply functioning as a
loan word (Poplack, 2001). Hashtags present a
unique challenge for distinguishing between the
two phenomena due their brief content and un-
structured usage: a hashtag may occur anywhere
in a tweet and its general content lacks grammat-
ical constraints. Examining the hashtags seen in
our study, we find evidence spanning both types
of uses. Common hashtags such as #win or #fail
are widely recognized outside of English and their
uses could easily be interpreted instances of bor-
rowing. However, the complexity of other hash-
tags gives the appearance that their uses go be-
yond that of borrowing, e.g., #goingbacktoschool
in “Nadie dijo que ser´ıa f´acil, pero c´omo cuesta
estudiar despu´es de 4 a˜nos de no tener nada
acad´emico cerquita #goingbacktoschool” where
the author is commenting on the difficulty of re-
turning for a degree. Still other posts include
multiple single-token hashtags from a second lan-
guage, e.g., the earlier example of “Jetzt gibt’s was
vern¨unftiges zum essen! #salad #turkey #lunch
#healthy #healthylifestyle #loveit.” Although indi-
vidually these hashtags may be widely recognized
and operate as interlingual markers, their com-
bined presence suggests an intentional language
shift on the part of the author that could be inter-
preted as code switching. Together, the examples
point to hashtag use by multiple languages as a
complex phenomena where shared hashtag enti-
ties exist on a graded scale from simple borrow-
ing to fully signaling code switching. Our study
is intended as a starting point for analyzing this
practice and all our data is made available to sup-
port future discussions on the roles these hashtags
play and how they facilitate communication both
within and across language communities.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999890269230769">
The present work has provided an initial study of
code switching in Twitter focusing on instances
where an author produces a message in one lan-
guage and then includes a hashtag from a sec-
ond language. Our work provides three main con-
tributions. First, using state-of-the-art language
identification techniques, we show that hashtags
are widely shared across languages, though the
challenges of correctly classifying the language
of tweets limits our ability to quantify the exact
scale. Second, in a manual analysis of ANNOTA-
TION and COMMUNITY hashtags, we show that
authors readily code switch with these types of
hashtags, using them just as they would in single
language tweets (e.g., indicating sarcasm). Third,
in a case study of French and English tweets from
three Francophone cities with bilingual speakers,
we find that the cities with more bilingual speakers
tended to have fewer occurrences English hashtags
in French tweets, which we speculate is due to au-
thors being more likely to write such tweets en-
tirely in English, rather than code switch; however,
when English hashtags were observed in French
tweets from these more bilingual cities, they were
much more likely to be used in instances of code
switching. Data for all of the experiments is

datasets/.
Our work raises several avenues for future
work. First, we plan to examine how to improve
language identification in microtext in order to
gain a more accurate estimation of hashtag sharing
and code switching rates for languages. Second,
the Twitter platform enables measuring additional
factors that may influence an individual’s rate of
code switching; specifically, we plan to investigate
(1) a user’s historical tweets to estimate the degree
of bilinguality and (2) the impact of a user’s social
network with respect to homophily and language
use.

In the first experiment, we perform a large scale analysis on the languages used in millions of posts to show that authors readily incorporate hashtags from other languages, and in a manual analysis of a subset the hashtags, reveal prolific code switching, with code switching occurring for some hashtags in over twenty languages.

The noisy nature of microtext is known to make language identification difficult (Bergsma et al., 2012; Goldszmidt et al., 2013) and can create spurious instances of second-language hashtag adoption. Therefore, we impose a minimum frequency of hashtag use where l2 is only said to use a hashtag of l1 if at least 20 tweets using that hashtag were labeled Hashtag # Langs.

After examining multiple accounts, we speculate that these messages are actually bot accounts who need to generate sufficient number of messages to avoid Twitter’s spam filters.

Typically, during code switching, the text or speech in a language retains its syntactic and morphological constraints for that language, rather than having text from both languages conform to one of the language’s grammatical rules. This requirement enables code switching to be separated from borrowing, where foreign words are integrated into a native language’s lexicon and morphology (Gumperz, 1982; Poplack et al., 1988; Sankoff et al., 1990). While work on code switching began with conversational analyses, recent work has examined the phenomena in electronic communication, finding similar evidence of code switching (Climent et al., 2003; Lee, 2007; Paolillo, 2011).

Hashtags provide authors with a communication medium that also has broader social utility by embedding their post within global discussion of other posts using the same hashtag (Letierce et al., 2010) or by becoming a part of a virtual community (Gupta et al., 2010). These social motivations resemble those seen for why individuals may code switch, such as to assimilate into a group or make discussions easier (Urciuoli, 1995). Twitter and other hashtag-supporting platforms such as Instagram and Facebook offer a unique setting for code switching hashtags for two reasons: (1) potential readers are disconnected from the author, who may not know of their language fluency, and (2) text translation is built into the platform, which enables readers to translate a post into their native language.

The present work differs significantly from these three studies in two aspects. First, we assess code switching across all language communities on Twitter, rather than examining individual groups of bilingual speakers. Second, we focus our analysis only on the code switching of a post’s hashtag due to its unique role in microtext (Gupta et al., 2010), which has yet to be examined in this context. 3 Hashtag Use in Twitter Hashtags provide general functionality on Twitter and prior works have proposed that they serve 52 Name Description Examples ANNOTATION Serves as an annotation about the author’s feelings or comments on the content of a tweet.

As such, authors may be motivated to include a hashtag of another language to increase their potential audience size or to appear as a member of a multilingual virtual community. Despite the prevalence of non-English tweets, which are approaching 50% of the total volume (Liu et al., 2014), no study has examined the prevalence of hashtag code switching. We propose an initial study of hashtag code switching in Twitter focusing on three central questions: (1) for which language pairs do authors write in the first language and then incorporate a hashtag of the second language, (2) when tweets include a hashtag of a different language, which instances signal code switching behavior, and (3) the degree to which bilingual populations code switch hashtags.

Language Identification The languages of tweets were identified using a two-step procedure. First, message content was filtered to remove content such as usernames, URLs, emoji, and hashtags. Tweets with fewer than three remaining tokens were excluded (e.g., a message with only hashtags). Second, the remaining content was processed using langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012), a state of the art language identification program that supports the diversity of languages found on Twitter. Determining the language of a hashtag in a general setting for all languages is difficult due to the presence of acronyms, abbreviations, and slang. Therefore, we adopt a heuristic where a hashtag’s language is set as the language used by the majority of its tweets. To quantify the accuracy of this heuristic, two annotators inspected the tweets of 200 hashtags to identify the language of the hashtag and for the majority of the tweets.

In the second experiment, French and English posts from three bilingual cities are analyzed for their code switching frequency and its content. 1 Introduction Online platforms enable individuals from a wide variety of linguistic backgrounds to communicate. When individuals share multiple languages in common, their communication will occasionally include linguistic elements from multiple languages (Nilep, 2006), a practice commonly referred to as code switching. Typically, during code switching, the text or speech in a language retains its syntactic and morphological constraints for that language, rather than having text from both languages conform to one of the language’s grammatical rules. This requirement enables code switching to be separated from borrowing, where foreign words are integrated into a native language’s lexicon and morphology (Gumperz, 1982; Poplack et al., 1988; Sankoff et al., 1990).

However, we observed that when both an English hashtag and its French translation were attested, the use of the English hashtag in French was most often an instance of code switching. Hence, testing for the presence hashtag translation pairs may serve as a helpful heuristic for identifying hashtags whose use signals code switching behavior. 6 Discussion Typically, code switching is distinguished from the related phenomena of borrowing by testing whether the word is being fluently mixed into the utterance instead of simply functioning as a loan word (Poplack, 2001). Hashtags present a unique challenge for distinguishing between the two phenomena due their brief content and unstructured usage: a hashtag may occur anywhere in a tweet and its general content lacks grammatical constraints. Examining the hashtags seen in our study, we find evidence spanning both types of uses. Common hashtags such as #win or #fail are widely recognized outside of English and their uses could easily be interpreted instances of borrowing. However, the complexity of other hashtags gives the appearance that their uses go beyond that of borrowing, e.g., #goingbacktoschool in “Nad</context>

Hashtags provide authors with a communication medium that also has broader social utility by embedding their post within global discussion of other posts using the same hashtag (Letierce et al., 2010) or by becoming a part of a virtual community (Gupta et al., 2010). These social motivations resemble those seen for why individuals may code switch, such as to assimilate into a group or make discussions easier (Urciuoli, 1995).

However, the diverse user base of the Twitter platform has given rise to additional roles for hashtags beyond these two. For example, many popular hashtags focus on promoting users to follow each other,1 such as #followback and #openfollow. Similarly, contests are run on Twitter, which have individuals vote by posting using a specific hashtag, e.g., #MtvHottest. Given hashtags’ flexible roles, some may be used in multiple languages without being examples of code switching, such as the contest-based or follower-promotion hashtags noted above.

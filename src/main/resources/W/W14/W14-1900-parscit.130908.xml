We are pleased to bring you the Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Speech and Language Processing
for Assistive Technologies (SLPAT), held in Baltimore, US on 26 June 2014. We received 9 paper
submissions, of which 7 were chosen for oral presentation. In addition, we have also accepted special
talks Technology Tools for Students With Autism: Innovations That Enhance Independence and Learning
by K.I. Boser, M. Goodwin, and S.C. Wayland, and Dysarthria as a noisy channel in speech production
by Frank Rudzicz.
This workshop is intended for researchers from all areas of speech and language technology with a
common interest in making everyday life more accessible for people with physical, cognitive, sensory,
emotional, or developmental disabilities. This workshop builds on four previous such workshops (co-
located with NAACL HLT 2010, EMNLP in 2011, NAACL HLT 2012, and Interspeech 2013), as well
as the previously held SMIAE workshop (co-located with ACL 2012). The workshop provides an
opportunity for individuals from research communities, and the individuals with whom they are working,
to share research findings, and to discuss present and future challenges and the potential for collaboration
and progress.
While augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is a particularly apt application area for
speech and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, we purposefully made the scope of the
workshop broad enough to include assistive technologies (AT) as a whole, even those falling outside
of AAC. While we encouraged work that validates methods with human experimental trials, we also
accepted work on basic-level innovations and philosophy, inspired by AT/AAC related problems. Thus
we have aimed at broad inclusivity, which is also manifest in the diversity of our Program Committee.
We would like to thank all the people and institutions who contributed to the success of the SLPAT 2014
workshop. Finally, we would like to thank the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) for
support in preparing and run the workshop.

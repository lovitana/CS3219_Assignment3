Named entity extraction is a fundamental task for many knowledge engineering applications.
Existing studies rely on annotated training data, which is quite expensive when used to obtain
large data sets, limiting the effectiveness of recognition. In this research, we propose an auto-
matic labeling procedure to prepare training data from structured resources which contain known
named entities. While this automatically labeled training data may contain noise, a self-testing
procedure may be used as a follow-up to remove low-confidence annotation and increase the
extraction performance with less training data. In addition to the preparation of labeled training
data, we also employed semi-supervised learning to utilize large unlabeled training data. By
modifying tri-training for sequence labeling and deriving the proper initialization, we can further
improve entity extraction. In the task of Chinese personal name extraction with 364,685 sen-
tences (8,672 news articles) and 54,449 (11,856 distinct) person names, an F-measure of 90.4%
can be achieved.

<bodyText confidence="0.999981">
Detecting named entities in documents is one of the most important tasks for message understanding.
For example, the #Microposts 2014 Workshop hosted an “Entity Extraction and Linking Challenge”,
which aimed to automatically extract entities from English microposts and link them to the correspond-
ing English DBpedia v3.9 resources (if a linkage existed). Like many other types of research, this task
relies on annotated training examples that require large amounts of manual labeling, leading to a limited
number of training examples (e.g. 2.3K tweets). While human-labelled training examples (𝐿) have high
quality, their cost is very high. Thus the major concern in this paper is how to prepare training data for
entity extraction learning on the Web.
In practice, sometimes there are existing structured databases of known entities that are valuable to
improve extraction accuracy. For examples, personal names, school names, and company names can be
obtained from a Who’s Who website, and accessible government data for registered schools and busi-
nesses, respectively. Meanwhile, there are many unlabeled training examples that can be used for many
information extraction tasks. If we can automatically label known entities in the unlabeled training ex-
amples, we can obtain large labeled training set. While such training data may contain errors, self-testing
can be applied to filter unreliable labeling with less confidence.
On the other hand, the use of unlabeled training examples (𝑈) has also been proved to be a promising
technique for classification. For example, co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) and tri-training (Zhou
et al. 2005) are two successful techniques that use examples with high-confidence as predicted by the
other classifier or examples with consensus answers from the other two classifiers in order to prepare
new labeled training data for learning. By estimating the error rate of each learned classifier, we can
calculate the maximum number of new consensus answers for learning to ensure the error rates are
reduced.
In this paper, we explore the possibility of extending semi-supervised learning to sequence labeling
via tri-training so that unlabeled training examples can also be used in the learning phase. The challenge
here is to obtain a common label sequence as a consensus answer from multiple models. As enumerating

all possible label sequences will be too time-consuming, we employ a confidence level to control the
co-labeling answer such that a label sequence with the largest probability is selected. Comparing with a
common label sequence from multiple models, the most probable label sequence has larger chance to
obtain a consensus answer for training and testing.
In addition to the extension of tri-training algorithm to sequence labeling, another key issue with tri-
training is the assumption of the initial error rate (0.5), leading to a limited number of co-labeling ex-
amples for training and early termination for large set training. Therefore, a new estimation method is
devised for the estimation of initial error rate to alleviate the problem and improve the overall perfor-
mance.
To validate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on Chinese personal name extraction using
7,000 known Chinese celebrity names (abbreviated as CCN). We collect news articles containing these
personal names from Google’s search engine (using these names as keywords) and automatically label
these articles containing CCN and known reporters’ names. In a test set of 8,672 news articles (364,685
sentences) containing 54,449 personal names (11,856 distinct names), the basic model built on CRF
(conditional random field) has a performance of 76.8% F-measure when using 500 celebrity names for
preparing training data, and is improved to 86.4% F-measure when 7,000 celebrity names are used. With
self-testing, the performance is improved to 88.9%. Finally, tri-training can further improve the perfor-
mance through unlabeled data to 90.4%.

Entity extraction is the task of recognizing named entities from unstructured text documents, which is
one of the information tasks to test how well a machine can understand the messages written in natural
language and automate mundane tasks normally performed by human. The development of machine
learning research from classification to sequence labeling such as the HMM (Hidden Markov Model)
(Bikel et al., 1997) and the CRF (Conditional Random Field) (McCallum and Wei, 2003) has been
widely discussed in recent years. While supervised learning shows an impressive improvement over
unsupervised learning, it requires large training data to be labeled with answers. Therefore, semi-super-
vised approaches are proposed.
Semi-supervised learning refers to techniques that also make use of unlabeled data for training. Many
approaches have been previously proposed for semi-supervised learning, including: generative models,
self-learning, co-training, graph-based methods (Zhou et al. 2005) and information-theoretic regulariza-
tion (Zheng et al. 2009). In contrast, although a number of semi-supervised classifications have been
proposed, semi-supervised learning for sequence segmentation has received considerably less attention
and is designed according to a different philosophy.
Co-training and tri-training have been mainly discussed for classification tasks with relatively few
labeled training examples. For example, the original co-training paper by Blum and Mitchell (1998)
described experiments to classify web pages into two classes using only 12 labeled web pages as exam-
ples. This co-training algorithm requires two views of the training data and learns a separate classifier
for each view using labeled examples. Nigam and Ghani (2000) demonstrated that co-training performed
better when the independent feature set assumption is valid. For comparison, they conducted their ex-
periments on the same (WebKB course) data set used by Blum and Mitchell.
Goldman and Zhou (2000) relaxed the redundant and independent assumption and presented an algo-
rithm that uses two different supervised learning algorithms to learn a separate classifier from the pro-
vided labeled data. Empirical results demonstrated that two standard classifiers can be used to success-
fully label data for each other with 95% confidence interval.
Tri-training (Zhou, et al. 2005) was an improvement of co-training, which used three classifiers and
a voting mechanism to solve the confidence issue of co-labeled answers by two classifiers. In each round
of tri-training, the classifiers hj and hk choose some examples in U to label for hi (i, j, k{1,2,3},
ijk). Let Ll denote the set of examples that are labeled for hi in the t-th round. Then the training set
for hi in the t-th round are L U Ll. Note that the unlabeled examples labeled in the t-th round, i.e. Ll,
won’t be put into the original labeled example set, i.e. L. Instead, in the (t + 1)-th round all the examples
in Ll will be regarded as unlabeled and put into U again.
While Tri-training has been used in many classification tasks, the application in sequence labeling
tasks is limited. Chen et al. (2006) proposed an agreement measure that computed the unit consistency

between two label sequences from two models. Then based on the agreement measure, the idea is to
choose a sentence, which is correctly labeled by ℎ𝑗 and ℎ𝑘 but is not parsed correctly by the target
classifier ℎ𝑖, to be a new training sample. A control parameter is used to determine the percentage (30%)
of examples selected for the next round. The process iterates until no more unlabeled examples are
available. Thus, Chen et al.’s method does not ensure the PAC learning theory.

Due to the high cost of labeling, most benchmarks for NER are limited to several thousand sentences.
For example, the English dataset for the CoNLL 2003 shared task (Tjong et al., 2003) consists of 14,987
training sentences for four entity categories, PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC. But it is unclear whether
sufficient data is provided for training or the learning algorithms have reached their capacity. Therefore,
two intuitive ways are considered in this paper: one is automatic labeling of unlabeled data for preparing
a large amount of annotated training examples, and the other is semi-supervised learning for making use
of both labeled and unlabeled data during learning.
For the former, automatic labeling is sometimes possible, especially for named entities which can be
obtained from Web resources like DBpedia. For example, suppose we want to train a named entity
extractor for the Reuters Corpus, we can use the known entities from CoNLL 2003 shared task as queries
to obtain documents that contain queries from the Reuters Corpus and label the articles automatically.
While such automatic annotation may involve wrong labeling, we can apply self-testing to filter low-
confidence labels. Overall, the benefit of the large amount of labeled training examples is greater than
the noise it may cause.
In this paper, we propose a hybrid model composed of the following modules: automatic labeling,
feature engineering, and tri-training based algorithm for training and testing. The framework is illus-
trated in Figure 1.

In order to estimate the size of |𝐿𝑖1|, i.e., the number of new training examples for the first round, we
need to estimate 𝑒𝑖0, 𝑒𝑖1, and |𝐿𝑖0 |first. Zhou et al. assumed a 0.5 error rate for 𝑒𝑖0, computed 𝑒𝑖1 by ℎ𝑗
and ℎ𝑘, and estimated the lower bound for |𝐿𝑖 0 |by Eq. (6), thus:

The problem with this initialization is that, for a larger dataset |𝐿|, such an initialization will have no
effect on retraining and will lead to an early stop for tri-training. For example, consider the case when
the error rate 𝑒𝑖1 is less than 0.4, then the value of |𝐿𝑖0 |will be no more than 5, leading to a small upper
bound for 𝑒𝑖1|𝐿𝑖1 |according to Eq. (1). That is to say, we can only sample a small subset |𝑆𝑖1 |from 𝐿𝑖1
for training ℎ𝑖 based on Eq. (4). On the other hand, if 𝑒𝑖1 is close to 0.5 such that the value of |𝐿𝑖0 |is
greater than the original dataset |𝐿 |, it may completely alter the behavior of ℎ𝑖.
To avoid this difficulty, we propose a new estimation for the product 𝑒 𝑖0|𝐿𝑖0|. Let 𝐿𝐶 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘) denote
the set of labeled examples (from 𝐿) on which the classification made by ℎ𝑗 is the same as that made by
ℎ𝑘 in the initial round, and 𝐿𝑊 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘) denote the set of examples from 𝐿𝐶 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘) on which both ℎ𝑗 and
ℎ𝑘 make incorrect classification, as shown in Eq. (7) and (8). In addition, we define 𝐿𝑖𝑊 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘) to be
the set of examples from 𝐿𝐶 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘) on which ℎ𝑖 makes incorrect classification in the initial round, as
shown in Eq. (9). The relationship among 𝐿𝐶 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘), 𝐿𝑊 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘), and 𝐿𝑖𝑊 (ℎ𝑗, ℎ𝑘) is illustrated in Figure

The tri-training algorithm was originally designed for traditional classification. For sequence labeling,
we need to define what should be the common labels for the input example x when two models (training
time) or three models (testing time) are involved. In Chen et al.’s work, they only consider the most
probable label sequence from each model; the selection method chooses examples (for hi) with the high-
est-agreement labeled sentences by hj and hk, and the lowest-agreement labeled sentences by hi and hj;
finally, the newly training samples were labeled by hj (ignoring the label result by hk).
As the probability for two sequence labelers to output the same label sequence is low (a total of 5|i|
(BIEOS Tagging) possible label sequences with length l), we propose a different method to resolve this
issue. Assume that each model can output the m best label sequences with highest probability (m=5).
Let Pi(Y|x) denote the probability that an instance x has label Y estimated by hi. We select the label
with the largest probability sum by the co-labeling models. In other words, we could use hj and hk to
estimate possible labels, then choose the label Y with the maximum probability sum, Pi (Y |x) + Pk (Y|x),
to re-train hi. Thus, the set of examples, Ll, prepared for hi in the t-th round is defined as follows:

<equation confidence="0.999822333333333">

<bodyText confidence="0.999980375">
where B (default 0.5) is a threshold that controls the quality of the training examples provided to hi.
During testing, the label Y for an instance x is determined by three models hl, h2 and h3. We choose
the output with the largest probability sum from 3 models with a confidence B * 3 or B * 2. If the label
with the largest probability sum from 3 models is not greater than B * 3, then we choose the one with
the largest probability from single model with a maximum probability. That is to say, if the label with
the largest probability sum from three models is not greater than B * 3, then we choose the one with the
largest probability sum from two models with a confidence of B * 2. The last selection criterion is the
label with the maximum probability estimated by the three models as shown in Eq. (12).

As mentioned above, using the query keyword itself to label the collected news articles (called uni-
labeling) only labels a small part of known person names. Therefore, we also use all celebrity names
and six report name patterns such as “UDN [reporter name]/Taipei” (4� [oi; ]/p3t �), to
label all collected articles (called Full-labelling). While this automatic labelling procedure does not en-
sure perfect training data, it provides acceptable labelled training for semi-supervised learning. As
shown in Figure 3, the automatic labelling procedure can greatly improve the performance on the testing
data.
Based on this basic model, we apply self-testing to filter examples with low confidence and retrain a
new model with the set of high confidence examples. The idea is to use the trained CRF model to test
the training data themselves and output the conditional probability for the most possible label sequence.
By removing examples with low confidence we can retrain a new model with the set of high confidence
examples. As indicated by black-dashed line (with + symbol) in Figure 4, the F-measures increases as
the data size increases. The performance of self-testing is improved for all datasets with confidence
levels from 0.5 to 0.9. An F-measure of 0.815 (Dataset 1) to 0.889 (Dataset 6) can be obtained, depend-
ing on the number of celebrity names we have. The best performance is achieved at confidence level 0.8

However, with the new initialization by Eq. (10), the number of examples that can be sampled from
unlabeled dataset |Ll |is greatly increased. For dataset 1, the unlabeled data selected is five times the
original data size (an increase from 4,637 to 25,234), leading to an improvement of 2.4% in F-measure
(from 0.815 to 0.839). For dataset 2, the final data size is twice the original data size (from 8,881 to
26,173) with an F-measure improvement of 2.7% (from 0.830 to 0.857). For dataset 6, since |Ll |is too
large to be loaded for training with L, we only use 75% for experiment. The improvement in F-measure
is 1.5%. Overall, an improvement of 1.2% ~ 2.7% can be obtained with this tri-training algorithm.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999565">
Named entity extraction has been approached with supervised approaches that require large labeled
training examples to achieve good performance. This research makes use of automatic labeling based
on known entity names to create a large corpus of labeled training data. While such data may contain
noise, the benefit with large labeled training data still is more significant than noise it inherits. In practice,
we might have a large amount of unlabeled data. Therefore, we applied tri-training to make use of such
unlabeled data and to modify the co-labeling mechanism for sequence labeling to improve the
performance. Instead of assuming a constant error rate for the initial error of each classifier, we proposed
a new way to estimate the number of examples selected from unlabeled data. As shown in the
experiments, such a semi-supervised approach can further improve the F-measure to 0.904 for dataset 6
with 7,000 celebrity names.

<abstract confidence="0.996603615384615">Named entity extraction is a fundamental task for many knowledge engineering applications. Existing studies rely on annotated training data, which is quite expensive when used to obtain large data sets, limiting the effectiveness of recognition. In this research, we propose an automatic labeling procedure to prepare training data from structured resources which contain known named entities. While this automatically labeled training data may contain noise, a self-testing procedure may be used as a follow-up to remove low-confidence annotation and increase the extraction performance with less training data. In addition to the preparation of labeled training data, we also employed semi-supervised learning to utilize large unlabeled training data. By modifying tri-training for sequence labeling and deriving the proper initialization, we can further improve entity extraction. In the task of Chinese personal name extraction with 364,685 sentences (8,672 news articles) and 54,449 (11,856 distinct) person names, an F-measure of 90.4% can be achieved.</abstract>

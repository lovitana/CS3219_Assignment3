In contrast to traditional rule-based approaches to building spoken
dialogue systems, recent research has shown that it is possible to imple-
ment all of the required functionality using statistical models trained
using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning.
This approach to spoken dialogue is based on the mathematics of par-
tially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in which user
inputs are treated as observations of some underlying belief state, and
system responses are determined by a policy which maps belief states
into actions.
Virtually all current spoken dialogue systems are designed to op-
erate in either a specific carefully defined domain such as restaurant
information and appointment booking, or they have very limited con-
versational ability such as in Siri and Google Now. However, if voice is
to become a significant input modality for accessing web-based infor-
mation and services, then techniques will be needed to enable conver-
sational spoken dialogue systems to operate within open domains.
This talk will discuss methods by which current statistical approaches
to spoken dialogue can be extended to cover much wider domains. It
will be argued that unlike many other areas of machine learning, spoken
dialogue systems always have a user on-hand to provide supervision.
Hence spoken dialogue systems provide a unique opportunity to auto-
matically adapt on large quantities of speech data without the need for
costly annotation.

Abstract: We focused on when and how to
reorder the Chinese NPs with two, three
translation units for reordering in
Chinese-English Machine Translation. By
analyzing the features of translation units of the
Chinese NPs, we built some formalized rules to
recognize the boundaries of translation units
using the boundary words to recognize what to
reorder. By comparing the orders of Chinese
and English NPs, we developed a strategy a
local phrase reordering model on how to
reorder the translation units. At last, we used a
rule-based MT system to test our work, and the
experimental results showed that our
rule-based method and strategy were very
efficient.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976622686567164">
Over the past decade, machine translation
(MT) has seen many exciting developments, but
phrase-based models, syntax-based models,
dependency-based models cannot deal with the
reordering at the sentence level very well,
particularly the reordering in a hierarchical
structure in which the reordering of Chinese NPs
is dependent on. The Hierarchical
Semantic-Category-Tree (HSCT) Model[1] used
semantic features to handle the reordering at
sentence level with a rule-based method. The
system based on HSCT model could partition a
sentence into a predicate and noun phases (NPs
for short) and reorder them in sentence level, but
this system did not reorder the inner orders in a
NP. This paper aims to solve a type of the
problem: reorder the inner components in a NP.
In Chinese-English MT, the structural
difference in NPs between Chinese to English is
a difficult problem, such as the different
positions for the head of the NPs: the head of a
Chinese NP is in the front; however that of an
English NP is in the end. The language for patent
usually was inclined to express complicated
thought in long and complex words. Here is an
example wherein the number of the translation
units in a complicated Chinese NP happens to be
three.
Example:
Chinese NP:所述图像传感器于红色、蓝色和
绿色色彩通道的光谱灵敏度
English in Chinese order: the image sensor
device in red, blue, and green color channels de
the spectral sensitivities
Reference: the spectral sensitivities of the
image sensor device in red, blue, and green color
channels
Google: an image sensor means in said red,
blue and green spectral sensitivity of color
channel.
The Chinese NP “所述图像传感器于红色、
蓝色和绿色色彩通道的光谱灵敏度”consists of
a Chinese character “的” and a function word
“于” and three translation units: A“所述图像传
感器”、B“于红色、蓝色和绿色色彩通道” and
C“光谱灵敏度”, and the right English order of
translation units was “C A B” according to the
reference. However, the boundaries of “B and C”
and the order of “A, B and C” in English of
Google were wrong.
How to recognize the boundaries of the
translation units “A, B, C” and how to reorder
them were the main problems that to be solved in
this paper.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. In Section 2, we at first the examined
the features of translation units and sum
boundary words for recognizing them, then
analyzed differences in the orders of complicated
Chinese-English NPs and summed a strategy on
how to reorder the translation units when
translate the complicated Chinese NPs to English.
In Section 3, we used a rule-based method and
designed a algorithm to recognize the translation
units to solve what to reorder and how to reorder.
In Section 4, we discussed the experiment results.
Section 5 is the related work. Finally, a

2 Analyses of the Chinese NPs

<bodyText confidence="0.999679">
In this section, we intent to develop a strategy
on reorder Chinese NP based on the translation
units.

2.1 Translation units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999828857142857">
This part focused on examining the features
of the translation units and tried to sum some
laws on the boundaries for recognizing the
translation units.
A translation unit was a word or word-group
of expressing the same meaning both in Chinese
and English. Translation units were the
equivalent in Chinese and English NPs, and it is
certain that this study can only be based on
contrasting Chinese and English NPs. The
complicated Chinese NP consists of NP or
prepositional phrases (PP for short), locative
phrase (LP for short) etc. The translation unit
may be as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.773265333333333">
(1) NP, which was a smallest unit for
reordering in Chinese-English machine
translation;
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.921865333333333">
(2)PP with a “preposition” and (1)
(3)LP with a “localizer” and (1)

“localizer”
(5) PP with a “preposition”, some (1) and a
“localizer”.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.393936">
2.1.1 Outer Characteristics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999683181818182">
In English, prepositions with flexible
meanings are frequently used. They function as
bonding agents in NPs. In English NPs, the
translation units can be obtained by the
prepositions, such as “the spectral sensitivities of
the image sensor device in red, blue, and green
color channels”, the prepositions “of” and “in”
can partition the NP into three translation units.
In Chinese NPs, the translation units can be
obtained by the prepositions, localizers and the
structural particle “的(de)”.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.977185">
• structural particle “的(de)”
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988042894736842">
Compare and analyze the difference as well
as locations between English modifiers and
Chinese auxiliary words so that the “的(de)” is
especial, which servers two functions. First, “的
(de)”, marked as “de1”, was a boundary of two
translation units and should be excluded from the
two translation units, such as the “的” in the
phrase “本发明的实施方式”, which consist two
translation units “本发明”and “实施方式”. “的
2”; second,“的(de)”, marked as “de2” , is an inner
conjunction of a translation unit, such as the “的”
in the phrase “简明的装置”
Here we focuses on “de1” and should
distinguish it from “de2”. Based on the studying
of the “的(de)”,we discovered some language
rules from authentic contexts: “de2” were often
behind of adjective, quantifier, verb and pronoun.
In view of the cost and practicability, “de2”can
be eliminated more easily.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.962129">
• prepositions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99593625">
Preposition is one of Chinese functional
words which have a complex function, involving
various factors, such as “在(zai),根据(gen ju),作
为(zuo wei)”etc. For example,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.937339">
• localizers
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9751515">
There is a special grammatical method in
Chinese language—the words of locality which
represent pure directions, such as “上(on),中(in),
外(outside)”.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.957332">
• others
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.950301705882353">
Some time nouns, such as “时(when)”and
some auxiliary words, such as “而言(er yan)”.
Some prepositions and some localizers work
hand in hand, such as “当 时”, “在 中”,
“对 而言”etc.
The prepositions and localizers always
worked with “de1”, for example, for Chinese NP
“ 一 种 或 多 种 作 为 湿 润 剂 的 醇 类 ”,the
preposition “作为” and structural particle “de1”
could partition it into three translation units, for
Chinese NP “通常运转时的气体压力”, the
localizer “时”and structural particle “de1” could
partition it into two translation units.
From the above analysis we could see
structural particle “ 的 (de)”, prepositions,
localizers and others could be outer boundaries
words for recognize the translation units.

2.1.2 Inner Characteristics

<bodyText confidence="0.999796833333333">
In Chinese NPs, the NPs may modify the NPs
without any prepositions, localizers and
structural particle, but not in English NPs.
This section explores some laws at the
beginning word and the end word of translation
units in Chinese-English translation.

language families, in most cases, the source
language cannot correspond to the target
language well. However, the internal
components of translation units shared some
characters in common as the result of linguistic
universality and identity of human thinking form.
By comparing the translation units, we can
obtain some features of the beginning of
translation units, which can be some implicit
boundaries of two translation units.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.964741">
• demonstrative pronoun
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999337857142857">
In English NPs, the translation units also can
be obtained by the definite articles and
demonstrative pronoun. In Chinese NPs, the
translation units also can be obtained by
demonstrative pronoun. For example, the
word “这些(these)” is demonstrative pronoun in
translation unit“这些业务(these services)”
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.958006">
• quantitative phrases
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999537125">
In Chinese NPs, the translation units could
not obtained by indefinite articles and
quantitative phrases. For example, the Chinese
phases “一个,一种” and so on correspond to the
English words “a, an, one” .
The Chinese words “第一, 第二, 第三, 第
四 ” correspond to the English words “first,
second, third, fourth”.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.943121">
• adjectives
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9951365">
An adjective usually modifies the noun.
The difference of Chinese and English exists in
many ways such as morphological structure and
word-formation which leads to the different
words for a semantic feature between Chinese
and English. Some adjectives, past participles,
present participles in English were expressed in
phase in Chinese.

The English adjective “notable” in translation
unit “notable features” which are unique for
English, thus appropriate version cannot find in
Chinese vocabulary and expressed in phases
“很显著” in translation unit “很显著的特点”,
wherein “很” is a degree adverb. There are
many degree adverbs in Chinese, for example &amp;quot;
很(very), 非常(extremely), 十分(very much),
特别 (specially), 极 (too),(little), 更 (more), 较
(better),比较(better), 最(best)&amp;quot; etc.

As can be seen above, although Chinese does
not have much overt morphology, it still
distinguishes a translation unit from another by
lexical devices.
When they were not outer boundary words in
one continuous string, we used demonstrative
pronoun, degree adverb, quantitative phrase,
adjective, time adverbs, negative adverbs
and others as the left boundary words to partition
the string into two translation units utilizing
contextual clues such as right characteristics. See
table 1 for examples.
When they were not outer boundary words in

2.1 Reordering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997958090909091">
Once the translation units had been
recognized, a new process called reordering can
be applied to them.
This part compared and analyzed the
differences in the orders of Chinese-English NPs
so as to find out the law and develop a strategy
on how to translate the complicated Chinese NPs
to English effectively.
According to the boundary words above, we
found that there are three types of translation
units:

</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.924892">
• NP_Bs
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.981039888888889">
NP_Bs is unique to Chinese. It could be
adjectives, pronouns, numerals and quantitative
phrases in special position, such as “一些” which
could occur in the NP “一些基于环保溶剂的清
洗剂” which consist of three translation units
“一些”, “基于环保溶剂” and “清洗剂”.
The Chinese NPs consist of NPs, PPs, LPs and
NP_Bs; otherwise, the English NPs consist of
NPs and PPs only.
The Chinese and English NPs share some
characters in common:1) the NPs consist of PPs
and NPs, 2) the PPs could not be head translation
units, 3) the NPs must be the head translation
units.
However, the position and order between the
NPs and PPs in Chinese were different from
English as the result of different culture and
tradition, especially, the NP_Bs, LPS are unique
for Chinese NPs. The primary dissimilarity is
that the head translation unit must locate in the
end and others translation units such as NPs, PPs
and LPs must be modifiers to some extent,
otherwise, in English, the beginning translation
unit is the head translation unit and followed by
other PPs as modifiers.
Based on aligned Chinese-English NP-pairs
from 15 Patent documents, this paper compared
the differences in orders of Chinese-English NPs
and analyzed types of translation units so as to
find out the laws in translating Chinese NPs to
English.
For Chinese NPs, the PPs and LPs shared
same function, so we use PPs for PPs and LPs.
2.1.1 Chinese NPs with two translation
units
All combinations and the structure relations
about two translation units can be listed in table
2, and we can see that in combinations of “NP1
NP2”, the NP1 or NP2 were the NPs and the
NP1 must modify NP2; in combinations of “PP
NP”, the NP must be the NPs and PP must
modify the NP.
For the PPs and LPs, the prepositions were
before the NPs and the locatives were behind the
NPs, but the PPs or LPs could be moved as a
whole. In table 2, we can see that there only one
reordering way for the Chinese NPs with two
translation units and b).
All structure relations between two translation
units occur in Chinese, and we can find some
examples to illustrate our reduction were right in
table 3.

We all know that ambiguity can be caused by
multiple and different semantic relations. So,
how to reorder seems to be a big problem.
However we could conclude some laws about
how to reorder the English orders of Chinese
NPs with three translation units as follows:

<bodyText confidence="0.994228777777778">
1) The reversed order is the only way for
Chinese NPs “NP1 NP2 NP3” which had three
modifications and three semantic relations;
2) The first NP and the reversed order for PP
is the only way for Chinese NPs “PP PP NP”.
For the pattern “((PP1 PP2) NP)-&gt;NP PP1 PP2”,
it only occurs in a kind of special Chinese NPs,
such as “Ak(from).....”, “Y�/rnj(to)......” ;
3) The first NP2, second NP1 and third PP is
the only way for Chinese NPs “PP NP1 NP2”
which had three structure relations and for
Chinese NPs “NP1 PP NP2”. For the pattern is
(NP1 PP NP2)-&gt;NP2 PP NP1, the PP in English
has the front boundary, and there is ambiguity,
too;
4) The first NP_E, second NP and third PP is
the only way for Chinese NPs “NP_B PP NP” in

In our existing MT system, the Chinese NPs
were given, but how to recognize the two or
three translation units in the Chinese NPs were
unknown. They can be obtained by using
boundary words, for an effective boundary word
or a combination of boundary words could not be
the end or beginning of a base NP in semantic
and partition a language string into two
translation units.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998763">
3.1 Recognitions

<bodyText confidence="0.995705133333333">
The boundary words have two types: 1) the
out boundary word ,such as “ M (de)” and
propositions, 2) the inner boundary words, which
include left boundary words and right boundary
words. The left boundary words lie in the first
word or phrase in a translation unit and the right
boundary words lie in the last word.
The Chinese NPs are stored using a tree
structure. Thus how to distinguish the “M(de)”
into “de1” and “de2”, how to recognize the front
and rear boundaries and how to combine the
words of a unit is important.
Using a rule-base method, we designed some
tags and attributes for nodes to recognize the
translation units:

<listItem confidence="0.990922">

putting the “de1” with a tag “MK”;
step2: recognizing the front and right
boundaries
• recognizing the front boundaries L1
when the words were prepositions
• putting a tag “MK_Q” on the left
boundary words when the words were
nouns, NUM or SPN before the left
boundary words;
• recognizing the rear boundaries L1H

• putting a tag “MK_H” on the right

In reordering phase, we defined the head NP
at the end as NP_E. Then, the NPs contained PPs,
NP_Bs, DE1, NP and NP_E. The strategies for
reordering the Chinese NPs are as follows:
Step1: building 1 reorder rule for the Chinese
NPs “NP_B PP NP”;
Step2: keeping the NP_Bs not moving and
move the PPs behind the NP_Es in reverse;
Step3: moving the other NPs behind the
NP_Es in reverse, delete the “的(de)” and add
the English word “of”.

Many reordering methods or strategy have
been proposed in recent years to address this
problem from different aspects. Phrase-based
models excel at capturing local reordering
phenomena and memorizing multi-word
translation [2], but they perform poorly in the long
and nested sentences in Patent. Syntax-based
models handle long-distance reordering better
than phase-based models. Reference [3]
introduced a set Syntax-based rules to decide if a
DE construction should be reordered or not
before translating to English. Reference [4]
focused on a Chinese noun phrase [A DE B] and
explored a log-linear DE classifier by using
syntactic, semantic and discourse context to
producing an English translation strategy.
Reference [1] explored a Hierarchical
Semantic-Category-Tree (HSCT) model, which
present a sentence as a hierarchical structure
based on the Hierarchical Network of Concepts
theory(HNC theory) and handle the reordering in
three levels: Sentence Level, Chunk Level and
Word Level. Reference [5,6,7] designed a
Chinese-English Patent Machine Translation
system based on the HSCT model.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999620153846154">
Based on analysis of translation units, we
used a rule-based method to recognize the
boundaries of the translation units using
boundary words. Based on the analysis
Chinese-English orders of Chinese NPs with two
or three translation units, we developed a
strategy on how to reorder the Chinese NPs. The
experimental results showed that our rule-based
method and strategy were very efficient on the
reordering the NPs.
In future, we will enrich and refine the rules
to improve the performance and research on how
translate Chinese NPs fluently.

This article proposes an annotation method of corpus
data for the purposes of providing a constructionist
account of lexical behavior. The lexical items in ques-
tion are seven verbs of motion in Modern Standard
Arabic that pertain to the events of COME (atā, gā’a,
haḍara, and qadima) and GO (ḏahaba, maḍā, and
rāha). The tag set selected for the annotation of the
COME and GO data frames consists of morpho-
syntactic tags that characterize verb usage as well as
semantic tags that aim to highlight the semantic com-
ponent of, for instance, adverbial and adpositional
phrases that accompany the verb. I will briefly
demonstrate the analytical potential of such data
frame by discussing the various kinds of statistical
tests such data frame is designed to undergo, as a
means of better understanding lexical behavior in con-
text, and, eventually, arriving at a better understand-
ing of lexical and constructional choices made by
native speakers of Arabic, as demonstrated in corpora.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999947029850746">
The core tenets of constructionist theories of
language claim that the basic unit of linguistic
organization is a construction. According to
Croft and Cruse (2004:257), a construction “con-
sist[s] of pairings of form and meaning that are at
least partially arbitrary”, where ‘meaning’ is re-
ferred to as the conventionalized function of a
construction. This conventionalization of a con-
struction’s meaning/function includes not only
the literal meaning of an utterance, but also the
discourse situation of that utterance, as well as
any pragmatic implication conveyed by that ut-
terance (Croft and Cruse, 2004).
The concept of a ‘construction’ in cognitive
approaches to grammar, therefore, relates to both
the idiomatic portions of language, where the
meaning of an utterance is not predictable from
the component parts of which it consists (e.g.
raining cats and dogs), as well as the co-
occurrence of any two (free or bound) mor-
phemes that reflect general morphosyntactic
structures and where the meaning of an utterance
is fully predictable from its component parts (e.g.
I need to sleep). Such view of grammar postu-
lates that “the interaction of syntax and lexicon is
much wider and deeper than the associations of
certain verbs with certain complements” (Bybee,
2010:77), and that a considerable part of our lin-
guistic knowledge consists of conventionalized
expressions, or constructions (Langacker, 1987).
In light of these constructionist assump-
tions, therefore, the behavior of a lexical item is
best understood in its context of use and not in
isolation, an idea that stretches back decades (cf.
Firth, 1957). This includes not only lexical collo-
cates, but also the entire morphosyntactic frame
that hosts a lexical item. All these elements con-
tribute to the composed or conventionalized
meaning/function expressed by a particular lin-
guistic item. In order to examine lexical behav-
ior, therefore, we need to move beyond single
semantic, morphological, or syntactic properties
of a lexical item and scrutinize the entire lexico-
syntactic frame in which it occurs. Increasingly,
this is done through examination of corpus data.
The availability of corpora facilitates and moti-
vates such highly contextualized analytical ap-
proach, since corpora provide a large amount of
naturally occurring, contextualized uses (as op-
posed to the reliance on introspective and elicited
data that may not reflect actual language usage at
all). Moreover, corpora provide large amounts of
linguistic data, which allows the researcher to
conduct extensive quantitative analyses of the
phenomenon in question.
In Modern Standard Arabic, the existence of
several verbs denoting the motion events COME
(atā, gā’a, haḍara, and qadima) and GO (ḏahaba,
maḍā, and rāha) provides an excellent case study
for a constructionist, corpus-based examination
of the features that characterize the usage of sup-
posedly near-synonymous lexical items. In
Abdulrahim (2013) I have argued that the four
COME verbs – as well as the three GO verbs – can
be interchangeably used in contexts where the
event depicts a strictly deictic and physical mo-
tion event, as in (1) and (2).

However, these verbs diverge greatly in
their metaphorical and idiomatic uses, in addition
to showing idiosyncratic patterns of lexico-
syntactic behavior. For instance, The sentence in
(1) would not admit all four verbs when the as-
pect inflection on the verb is changed. To illus-
trate, in (3), if we hold all constructional features
constant and change verb inflection from perfec-
tive to jussive, this results in a preference for atā
and hadara by native speakers of Arabic over
gā’a or qadima.

The above example stresses the need to in-
vestigate features of the lexico-syntactic con-
struction that each COME verb most typically as-
sociates with. For these purposes, I have adopted
the methodological approach outlined in Gries
(2006), Gries &amp; Divjak (2009), and Gries &amp;
Otani (2010) for a constructionist description of
the Behavioral Profile of a lexical item. I have
also employed logistic regression – namely
polytomous logistic regression, outlined in detail
in Arppe (2008) – as a statistical method that
models lexical or constructional choices as a
function of a wide range of contextual features.
The quantitative approach to lexical analysis
presented in this paper involves constructing a
data frame for every lexical item under study, in
which numerous corpus concordance lines are
individually marked-up for an extensive set of
linguistic features (morphological, syntactic, and
semantic). This includes, for examples, specific
elements pertaining to verb morphology, phrase
structure, as well as the different elements that
co-occur with the verb in specific constructions.
Such data frame can undergo numerous explora-
tory and multi-variate statistical tests as a means
of zeroing in on the kinds of constructions asso-
ciated with the verbs in question.

2 The corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977093023256">
In order to construct the multi-variate data
frame for the analysis of motion verbs in Arabic,
I chose ArabiCorpus (arabicorpus.byu.edu) as
the source for data. ArabiCorpus is a free online
corpus developed by Dilworth Parkinson at
Brigham Young University. As of October 2012,
the corpus contains around 146,000,000 word
tokens from different written and spoken genres.
At the time of data collection (Fall 2010) the
corpus contained around 69,000,000 word to-
kens. Additional MSA as well as pre-modern
texts have been added to the corpus since the
beginning of 2011. Texts included in
ArabiCorpus almost exclusively belong to the
written genre, save for a small sub-corpus of
spoken Egyptian Arabic. The written genres cov-
ered in ArabiCorpus vary from newspaper writ-
ing, pre-modern writing, modern literature, to
nonfiction. These genres are represented in the
corpus in varying proportions with newspaper
writing accounting for over 90% of the total size
of the entire corpus. News articles included in
this sub-section of ArabiCorpus cover issues
from 1996 to 2010 and are extracted from peri-
odicals published in different parts of the Arab
world (North Africa, Egypt, Arabian Gulf, the
Levant, etc.). For this study, the MSA sub-
corpora that were queried for COME and GO uses
are related to newspaper, modern literature, and
nonfiction writing. As expected, most examples
returned from corpus queries were in fact drawn
from the newspaper genre.
ArabiCorpus is not tagged for parts-of-
speech (POS) which makes the search for partic-
ular grammatical categories a daunting task.
Nevertheless, it can be easily queried using regu-
lar expressions. This study targeted very specific
inflected forms of the MSA verb: perfective, im-
perfective, jussive, subjunctive, and imperative;
and excluded participial forms (e.g. active parti-
ciple) and nominal forms (e.g. verbal nouns).
Relying on orthographic regular expressions,
therefore, proved to be the most efficient method
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99759">
29
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967615384615">
for querying these particular forms. What may
complicate any search in an Arabic written cor-
pus is the lack of short vowels which are indicat-
ed by certain diacritics written over or under-
neath a letter. Naturally, it was necessary to filter
corpus returns manually to eliminate any irrele-
vant forms that may have been returned in the
corpus search.
Despite the time-consuming nature of such
corpus querying steps, ArabiCorpus proved to be
a reliable and rich source for contextualized lan-
guage uses. Add to that the fact that even though
the online interface of ArabiCorpus only displays
10 words before and after the KWIC (key word
in context), the researcher can still retrieve the
entire text hosting that sentence. Therefore when
the analysis or the annotation requires going be-
yond the 10 word window to examine the entire
phrase structure, it is possible to retrieve such
information from ArabiCorpus. Another added
benefit of using the online interface of
ArabiCorpus is the ease of downloading all re-
turned hits of a certain lexical item or construc-
tion to be viewed in a spreadsheet, which was a
major step in the collection of data for this re-
search.

3 COME and GO data frames
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999565588235294">
In Abdulrahim (2013) I proposed a quantita-
tive (as well as a qualitative) analysis based on
the construction of a data frame for each one of
the seven verbs of motion. Each individual data
frame is typically composed of a large number of
corpus concordance lines (500 concordance
lines) involving the KWIC (i.e. verb under inves-
tigation) in its natural context of use. Every con-
cordance line is thoroughly examined and tagged
for a wide range of morphosyntactic and seman-
tic features. These constructional features include
the syntactic structure that hosts the verb, the
patterns of verbal inflections for every instance
of verb use (e.g. subject number, person, and
gender, as well as other morphosyntactic aspects
of the Arabic verb), the semantic properties of
other components of the construction (e.g. se-
mantic properties of the subject), as well as the
inclusion or exclusion of phrases, lexical items,
or clitics denoting a starting point of the event
(SOURCE), a terminal point of the event (GOAL),
etc.
Such a heavily annotated dataset has the po-
tential of being explored statistically in multiple
ways via simple frequency count methods as
well as complex multi-variate statistical model-
ing. Such quantitative approach to analyzing
corpus data aims to define the specific character-
istics of the constructions associated with the
various meanings and functions of each MSA
COME and GO verb involved in this study. In the
following section I will elaborate on the selection
of these contextual features for the annotation of
COME and GO data frames.

The first step for creating a multi-variate da-
ta frame is to generate a list of features or varia-
bles which are relevant to the motion event
schemas in questions and which reflect the
morphosyntax of Modern Standard Arabic.
Along the lines of Gries’s study on the polysemy
of the English verb run (2006), Gries and
Divjak’s (2006) investigation of Russian verbs of
TRY, as well as Gries and Otani’s (2010) analysis
of the synonymy and polysemy of adjectives of
size in English, I developed a large set of mor-
phological, syntactic, and semantic features that
reflect the usage of MSA motion verbs.
The variable set includes nominal variables
(multiple levels) and binary variables (YES/NO
values indicating absence or presence of feature).
Table 1 shows the different categories of varia-
bles subsumed under morphological, syntactic,
and semantic variables. In Appendix A, I provide
examples and illustrations of the different anno-
tations of levels within semantic variables taken
from the actual data frame. 1

1 The data frame was, in fact, coded for more variables than
the set laid out in Table 4, such as the different
morphosyntactic realizations of GOAL, SOURCE, MANNER,
etc., as well as certain recurring lexical elements (e.g. ad-
verbs, adverbial uses, and other lexical items). These addi-
tional variables did not form part of the quantitative analysis
in Abdulrahim (2013). Nevertheless, they are of some in-
terest and proved to be useful for a qualitative analysis of
MSA motion verbs.

As mentioned earlier, the primary motiva-
tion for this set of 23 linguistic features/tags has
been the lexico-syntactic properties of deictic
motion event schemas in MSA. For instance, a
deictic motion event is likely to include a phrase
specifying a GOAL and/or a SOURCE of the mo-
tion event. In addition, it may include MANNER
of motion and the inclusion of a COMITATIVE
phrase (i.e. accompaniment by an ob-
ject/individual in the GO or COME event). Each
verb usage was also coded for the semantic cate-
gory of the sentential subject or, conceptually
speaking, the moving entity involved in the mo-
tion event. These categories include HUMAN, OB-
JECT or ARTIFACT, and also more abstract/non-
physical entities such as EVENT, COMMUNICA-
TION (e.g. a statement), COGNITION (e.g. an
idea), etc. As for the morphosyntactic features
selected for tagging motion verbs, these reflect
the inflectional properties of the MSA verb
(MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECT AND MOOD, NUMBER,
PERSON, and GENDER) as well as TENSE and AS-
PECT. The variable labeled TRANSITIVITY, only
pertains to certain uses of COME verbs in MSA
where COME verbs can appear in transitive con-
structions in which the direct object is the GOAL
of the motion event.
Text genre was not considered a variable
since, as I mentioned earlier, the majority of the
annotated 3,500 corpus hits belong to the genre
of newspaper writing. Results obtained from ex-
amining this data frame should, therefore, be
considered as mostly reflective of the usage of
COME and GO verbs in newspaper writing. Sen-
tence (4) is an example of a contextualized verb
use annotated for the features listed above.

A wide range of statistical tests can be ap-
plied in order to explore the data frames de-
scribed above for various purposes. 2 For in-
stance, we can simply run the COME and GO data
frames through mono-variate exploratory tests
such as chi-square tests as a means of zeroing in
on the distribution of contextual elements per
each GO and COME verb. This kind of analysis
would constitute a first step towards identifying
divergence in usage patterns associated with each
MSA motion verb. This preliminary step further
motivates and justifies the examination of inter-
action patterns among the contextual features, as

well as the identification of clusters of features
that are closely tied to certain verb uses. A multi-
variate analysis eventually facilitates the identifi-
cation of prototypical uses of each verb as well
as the less prototypical uses. In the following I
will briefly discuss three types of statistical
methods that can be applied to the MSA COME
and GO data frames: (i) chi-square test; (ii) clus-
ter analysis; and (iii) polytomous logistic regres-
sion analysis.3

The primary purpose of subjecting the
COME and GO data frames to chi-square test of
independence is to examine whether the distribu-
tion of the different levels of variables (tags) do
not vary as a function of verb (null hypothesis),
or, if they actually do vary as a function of verb
(alternative hypothesis). For instance, if we ex-
amine the occurrence of a GOAL phrase per each
GO verb, would the distribution of variables be
the same or different across the three verbs. To
test this hypothesis –where we have an inde-
pendent variable (verb) and a dependent variable
(GOAL) –we can run a chi-square test on variable
distribution. Table 2 shows the observed fre-
quencies for the occurrence/absence of a GOAL
phrase per each GO verb, while Table 3 shows
the expected frequencies calculated by the com-
mand chisq.test()$expected in R (www.r-

The calculated Pearson’s chi-square test for
the distribution given in Table 4 proved to be
quite significant: X2 = 277.1034, df = 6, p-value

variable GOAL for each GO verb deviates highly
significantly from the expected distribution.
We can also examine the cell-wise diver-
gences from a uniform distribution for this par-
ticular contingency table by conducting a stand-
ardized Pearson’s residual (discussed in Agresti
2002: 81; Arppe, 2008: 83-84). These test statis-
tics can either be retrieved in R by using the
command chisq.test()$std or by running the func-
tion chisq.posthoc(), which is part of the statisti-
cal package {polytomous} developed by Antti
Arppe (2012). Table 4 contains the calculated
values, which indicate whether the observed co-
occurrence frequency reported in each individual
cell is significantly more or less than expected.4
The chisq.posthoc()function presents an easier
way to interpret these figures, in that it assigns
+/–/0 values for each cell, which can be inter-
preted as insignificant (0), significantly more
than expected (+), or significantly less than ex-
pected (–).

tive cluster analysis (explained more in detail in
Gries, 2006; Diviaj and Gries, 2006; Gries and
Otani, 2010, among others). Generally speaking,
this clustering method groups together the lexical
elements that are most similar to one another
and, at the same time, the ones that are highly
dissimilar to other elements in other clusters.
Therefore, what we expect to see from this statis-
tical method is a clustering dendrogram that
shows us which COME or GO verbs overlap in
their usage as opposed to the ones with which
they hardly share any characteristics.
This method requires generating a table that
lists relative frequencies (or proportions) of co-
occurrence values of dependent variables per
independent variable (the GO and COME verbs
under study). A similarity/dissimilarity matrix is
first computed, followed by computing a cluster
structure based on a specific amalgamation rule.5
The resulting cluster structure can then be visual-
ly represented in a dendrogram. The calculations
involved in the different stages of hierarchical
agglomerative cluster analysis have been made
easier to conduct using BP 1.01 script, a program
written by Stefan Gries (2009) for R. This R-
based script uses a host of statistical methods
required in the stages mentioned above. It initial-
ly generates a co-occurrence table of relative fre-
quencies of the different levels (IDTAG-LEVELs)
within variables (IDTAGs). 6 Table 5 shows a
sample of such output table generated by BP
1.01 for the distribution of TENSE by COME verb.

be subjected to a number of tests including the
hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. For
this particular clustering technique I relied on the
(dis)similarity metric ‘Canberra’, and ‘Ward’ as
the amalgamation rule that computes a cluster
structure.7
The dendrogram in Figure 1 shows two ma-
jor divides between the four verbs that the hier-
archical agglomerative cluster analysis deemed
significant. The first cluster (on the left) formed
in this analysis appears to group the verbs atā
and gā’a together, while the other cluster groups
haḍara and qadima together. Here, we find that
the AU p-value (Approximately Unbiased) –
which is a probability measure computed through
multi-scale bootstrap resampling – for the cluster
containing haḍara and qadima is calculated to
approximate 87%, while the AU p-value for the
cluster of atā and gā’a is 82%. Again, this does
not necessarily imply that haḍara and qadima
are highly similar, but that they are very dissimi-
lar from atā and ga’a in their usage. Indeed, sub-
sequent mutli-variate as well as qualitative anal-
yses showed that atā and gā’a shared more usage
patterns than they did with the other COME verbs.

2008), in particular, applies advanced algorithms
in order to determine the relative effects of mul-
tiple predictor variables (the tags/contextual fea-
tures) on the choice of more than two outcome
variables (i.e. the four COME verbs and the three
GO verbs). Generally speaking, logistic regres-
sion would estimate probabilities of the occur-
rence of each COME or GO verb given a particular
context of use, and is therefore compatible with
the view that linguistic choices are probabilistic
rather than categorical (Bresnan, 2006; Arppe,
2007, 2008, 2009; among others). In a nutshell,
polytomous logistic regression estimates variable
parameters which can be interpreted “naturally”
as odds (Harrell 2001). In other words, it deter-
mines the extent to which the existence of a vari-
able (i.e. feature/tag) in the context increases (or
decreases) the chances of a particular outcome
(i.e. verb) to occur, with all the other explanatory
variables being equal.
To illustrate, we can conduct such analysis
on the annotated COME data frame. The first step
is to select a set of variables to include in the
model. Note, however, that the binary and nomi-
nal variables listed in Table 1 need to be con-
verted into the form of logical variables in order
to be included in the logistic regression model.8
The selection of these variables relies, first of all,
on a mono-variate analysis (such as the inspec-
tion of standardized Pearson’s residuals) as a
means of figuring out which variables seem to
have explanatory potential as opposed to those
that do not. A second criterion for variable selec-
tion relies on inspecting pair-wise association
patterns between variables. That is to say, we
need to examine the extent to which certain vari-
ables have a high rate of co-occurrence, as a
means of reducing collinearity in the regression
model. The model listed in (5) includes 30 logi-
cal variables as the independent variables and the
COME verb as a dependent variable.

The overall accuracy rate calculated for this
model is 0.845. The accuracy measure (Menard,
1995: 28-30; Arppe, 2008: 129-132) corresponds
to the number of times the model assigned the
highest probability estimate to the actually ob-
served verb in a given annotated context. We can
also examine the individual accuracy rates per
verb as a means of zeroing in on which particular
verb(s) the model was more successful in pre-
dicting. We can now examine the probability
estimates that the polytomous logistic regression
analysis assigns to each of the COME verbs per
annotated context (4 verbs * 2,000 sentences).
These estimated probabilities range from very
high values (approaching 1.00) to very low val-
ues (approaching 0.00) and any values in be-
tween, depending on the set of predictors (i.e.
contextual features) present in a particular con-
text of use. We can illustrate with sentences (6)
and (7) which are extracted from the original da-
ta frame. In (6) the verb received an almost cate-
gorical probability estimate, while in (7) the verb
received a less categorical probability estimate. It
is also possible to examine the set of contextual
features that each sentences was tagged for and
which were used as predictor variables in the
logistic regression model

The sentence in (6) can be considered as a
prototypical use of the verb gā’a. In (7), howev-
er, note that the verb which received the highest
probability estimate was not the actually ob-
served verb in that context. Nevertheless, all four
verbs were assigned more-or-less equal probabil-
ity estimates. This may indicate that this is one
context of use in which the four COME verbs can
be used interchangeably. Relying on my native
speaker intuition, substituting the observed verb
with the other COME verbs in (7) does not raise
any red flags, especially since this particular con-
texts of use indicates physical motion of a HU-
MAN agent, as I discussed earlier in this paper.
Of course, not all predictions made by the
model were accurate. Among the sentences for
which a single verb received a very high proba-
bility estimate, a number of instances in which
the predicted verb was not the observed verb
were found. Such sentences proved to be worthy
of scrutiny due to the fact that some of these
“mis-predictions” were associated with less typi-
cal uses of the verb that was actually observed in
context. For instance, in (8), the verb qadima
was the verb observed in context, yet the model
chose ḥaḍara instead as the verb that was most
fitting in that context.

Interestingly, this particular usage of
qadima in (8) can be found in a specific genre,
that of historical narrative. While atā, gā’a, and
ḥaḍara may all appear in transitive constructions
in MSA, qadima normally does not. It is, howev-
er, used in transitive constructions to signal a
shift in register, as in the example in (8). Since
such pattern of use occurs less frequently than
the general overall usage of qadima, the model
assigns ḥaḍara instead as the most plausible verb
choice for such context. Careful inspection of
“mis-predictions” such as the above is, therefore,
an important step to identify the less typical uses
of verbs, as well as to decide whether the varia-
ble set chosen for the model has or has not been
effective in accounting for verb usage. The prob-
ability estimates calculated for the GO data frame
did not yield such satisfying results, and did not
necessarily agree with my native speaker’s intui-
tion. In Abdulrahim (2013: 101) I attributed such
findings to the set of variables that GO verbs
were coded for in the data frame (which, more or
less, resembled the variable set COME verbs were
coded for). More specifically I suggested that the
data frame should include more lexical or
collocational variables.

<bodyText confidence="0.999904428571429">
The methodological approach to lexical
analysis, described here, represents a departure
from traditional, compartmentalized treatments
of the Arabic verb. In this paper, I have adopted
a construction-based approach that considers var-
ious aspects of language (morphology, syntax,
semantics, etc.) as equally responsible for defin-

ing the behavior of a linguistic item. The creation
of a 500-row data frame per verb has allowed us
to probe into the frequency and distribution facts
regarding the usage of seven highly frequent mo-
tion verbs in MSA. Moreover, the annotation of
each corpus return for a wide range of contextual
and semantic features offered the possibility of
foregrounding the most prototypical aspects of
use for each verb, as well as highlighting shared
patterns of usage among the near-synonymous
verbs in a set. In this paper, I have argued that
the value of constructing a data frame of this
type lies in developing more sophisticated
lexico-syntactic frames of linguistic items, in that
it allows us to extract preferred profiles of the
lexical or constructional items under study.
Thankfully, there is a wide range of statisti-
cal tests that have made the examination of and
search for lexico-syntactic patterns in large data
frames easier and more manageable. These sta-
tistical tests vary from simple, mono-variate ex-
ploratory test to complex and multi-variate pre-
dictive models. Each one of the three statistical
analyses discussed in this paper serves to high-
light a particular aspect of variable distribution
and variable interaction and, thus, helps us un-
derstand the complexity of the relationship be-
tween the near-synonymous COME and GO verbs.
Generally speaking, the application of such sta-
tistical tests to large, multi-variate data frames
helps us examine the particular linguistic features
that characterize lexical and constructional
choices, which may have direct applications in
natural language generation. In addition, the
identification of prototypical and marginal uses
of verbs – discussed particularly in 4.3 – can
possibly contribute to developing readability as-
sessment of texts for learners of MSA.9
Finally, lexicographic treatments of the
highly frequent motion verbs discussed in this
paper, as exhibited in bilingual and, mostly,
monolingual dictionaries, range from almost ad-
equate to completely mis-representative descrip-
tions of the major and minor senses of these
verbs (Abdulrahim, 2013). Many monolingual
dictionaries follow a traditional and highly ideo-
logical system of lexical representation whereby
archaic uses of a lexical item are foregrounded
and little attention is paid to more contemporary
uses. The quantitative (and qualitative) analysis
of a data frame such as the ones described here

per for pointing out these particular applications of the sta-
tistical methods discussed here.
can help tease apart the different idiosyncratic
uses for each of the seven motion verbs as well
as identify the most and the least prototypical
uses. One of the practical applications of such a
data frame, therefore, is to create extensive, us-
age-based dictionary entries that are more repre-
sentative of contemporary language use and that
would be useful for the native speaker of the lan-
guage, the language learner, and the language
researcher.10

Moreover, corpora provide large amounts of linguistic data, which allows the researcher to conduct extensive quantitative analyses of the phenomenon in question. In Modern Standard Arabic, the existence of several verbs denoting the motion events COME (atā, gā’a, haḍara, and qadima) and GO (ḏahaba, maḍā, and rāha) provides an excellent case study for a constructionist, corpus-based examination of the features that characterize the usage of supposedly near-synonymous lexical items. In Abdulrahim (2013) I have argued that the four COME verbs – as well as the three GO verbs – can be interchangeably used in contexts where the event depicts a strictly deictic and physical motion event, as in (1) and (2). 28 Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Arabic Natural Langauge Processing (ANLP), pages 28–38, October 25, 2014, Doha, Qatar. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics (1) راطملا ىلإ يتدج تمدق / ترضح / تءاج / تتأ atā / ǧā’a / haḍara / grandmother.CL.1SG.GEN qadima.PERF.3SG.F came my grandmother ALL ART=airport to the airport ‘My grandmother came to the airport’ (2) ةطرشلا زكرم ىلإ </context>

Therefore when the analysis or the annotation requires going beyond the 10 word window to examine the entire phrase structure, it is possible to retrieve such information from ArabiCorpus. Another added benefit of using the online interface of ArabiCorpus is the ease of downloading all returned hits of a certain lexical item or construction to be viewed in a spreadsheet, which was a major step in the collection of data for this research. 3 COME and GO data frames In Abdulrahim (2013) I proposed a quantitative (as well as a qualitative) analysis based on the construction of a data frame for each one of the seven verbs of motion. Each individual data frame is typically composed of a large number of corpus concordance lines (500 concordance lines) involving the KWIC (i.e. verb under investigation) in its natural context of use. Every concordance line is thoroughly examined and tagged for a wide range of morphosyntactic and semantic features.

These additional variables did not form part of the quantitative analysis in Abdulrahim (2013).

Careful inspection of “mis-predictions” such as the above is, therefore, an important step to identify the less typical uses of verbs, as well as to decide whether the variable set chosen for the model has or has not been effective in accounting for verb usage. The probability estimates calculated for the GO data frame did not yield such satisfying results, and did not necessarily agree with my native speaker’s intuition. In Abdulrahim (2013: 101) I attributed such findings to the set of variables that GO verbs were coded for in the data frame (which, more or less, resembled the variable set COME verbs were coded for). More specifically I suggested that the data frame should include more lexical or collocational variables. 5 Conclusions The methodological approach to lexical analysis, described here, represents a departure from traditional, compartmentalized treatments of the Arabic verb.

In addition, the identification of prototypical and marginal uses of verbs – discussed particularly in 4.3 – can possibly contribute to developing readability assessment of texts for learners of MSA.9 Finally, lexicographic treatments of the highly frequent motion verbs discussed in this paper, as exhibited in bilingual and, mostly, monolingual dictionaries, range from almost adequate to completely mis-representative descriptions of the major and minor senses of these verbs (Abdulrahim, 2013). Many monolingual dictionaries follow a traditional and highly ideological system of lexical representation whereby archaic uses of a lexical item are foregrounded and little attention is paid to more contemporary uses. The quantitative (and qualitative) analysis of a data frame such as the ones described here 9 I would like to thank an anonymous reviewers of this paper for pointing out these particular applications of the statistical methods discussed here. can help tease apart the different idiosyncratic uses for each of the seven motion verbs as well as identify the most and the least prot</context>

This kind of analysis would constitute a first step towards identifying divergence in usage patterns associated with each MSA motion verb. This preliminary step further motivates and justifies the examination of interaction patterns among the contextual features, as 2 See Hastie, T., et al (2009), and Agresti (2002) – among others – for comprehensive discussions on statistical tests that can be applied to multi-variate data frames. 31 well as the identification of clusters of features that are closely tied to certain verb uses. A multivariate analysis eventually facilitates the identification of prototypical uses of each verb as well as the less prototypical uses.

Such view of grammar postulates that “the interaction of syntax and lexicon is much wider and deeper than the associations of certain verbs with certain complements” (Bybee, 2010:77), and that a considerable part of our linguistic knowledge consists of conventionalized expressions, or constructions (Langacker, 1987). In light of these constructionist assumptions, therefore, the behavior of a lexical item is best understood in its context of use and not in isolation, an idea that stretches back decades (cf.

According to Croft and Cruse (2004:257), a construction “consist[s] of pairings of form and meaning that are at least partially arbitrary”, where ‘meaning’ is referred to as the conventionalized function of a construction. This conventionalization of a construction’s meaning/function includes not only the literal meaning of an utterance, but also the discourse situation of that utterance, as well as any pragmatic implication conveyed by that utterance (Croft and Cruse, 2004).

Therefore, what we expect to see from this statistical method is a clustering dendrogram that shows us which COME or GO verbs overlap in their usage as opposed to the ones with which they hardly share any characteristics.

This method requires generating a table that lists relative frequencies (or proportions) of cooccurrence values of dependent variables per independent variable (the GO and COME verbs under study). A similarity/dissimilarity matrix is first computed, followed by computing a cluster structure based on a specific amalgamation rule.5 The resulting cluster structure can then be visually represented in a dendrogram. The calculations involved in the different stages of hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis have been made easier to conduct using BP 1.01 script, a program written by Stefan Gries (2009) for R. This Rbased script uses a host of statistical methods required in the stages mentioned above. It initially generates a co-occurrence table of relative frequencies of the different levels (IDTAG-LEVELs) within variables (IDTAGs). 6 Table 5 shows a sample of such output table generated by BP 1.01 for the distribution of TENSE by COME verb.

Dendrogram based on the COME multivariate data frame. 4.3 Polytomous logistic regression Another multi-variate analysis that can be applied to this kind of data frame for the purpose of examining patterns of variable interaction is logistic regression. Polytomous logistic regression analysis (explained in detail in Arppe, 7 For a detailed description of this clustering method see Gries (2009), pp 306-319. columns sum to 1.0 33 2008), in particular, applies advanced algorithms in order to determine the relative effects of multiple predictor variables (the tags/contextual features) on the choice of more than two outcome variables (i.e. the four COME verbs and the three GO verbs). Generally speaking, logistic regression would estimate probabilities of the occurrence of each COME or GO verb given a particular context of use, and is therefore compatible with the view that linguistic choices are probabilistic rather than categorical (Bresnan, 2006; Arppe, 2007, 2008, 2009; among others)</context>

I have also employed logistic regression – namely polytomous logistic regression, outlined in detail in Arppe (2008) – as a statistical method that models lexical or constructional choices as a function of a wide range of contextual features.

Generally speaking, logistic regression would estimate probabilities of the occurrence of each COME or GO verb given a particular context of use, and is therefore compatible with the view that linguistic choices are probabilistic rather than categorical (Bresnan, 2006; Arppe, 2007, 2008, 2009; among others). In a nutshell, polytomous logistic regression estimates variable parameters which can be interpreted “naturally” as odds (Harrell 2001). In other words, it determines the extent to which the existence of a variable (i.e. feature/tag) in the context increases (or decreases) the chances of a particular outcome (i.e. verb) to occur, with all the other explanatory variables being equal. To illustrate, we can conduct such analysis on the annotated COME data frame. The first step is to select a set of variables to include in the model. Note, however, that the binary and nominal variables listed in Table 1 need to be converted into the form of logical variables in order to be included in the logistic regression model.8 The selection</context>

Such view of grammar postulates that “the interaction of syntax and lexicon is much wider and deeper than the associations of certain verbs with certain complements” (Bybee, 2010:77), and that a considerable part of our linguistic knowledge consists of conventionalized expressions, or constructions (Langacker, 1987). In light of these constructionist assumptions, therefore, the behavior of a lexical item is best understood in its context of use and not in isolation, an idea that stretches back decades (cf. Firth, 1957). This includes not only lexical collocates, but also the entire morphosyntactic frame that hosts a lexical item. All these elements contribute to the composed or conventionalized meaning/function expressed by a particular linguistic item. In order to examine lexical behavior, therefore, we need to move beyond single semantic, morphological, or syntactic properties of a lexical item and scr</context>

We can also examine the individual accuracy rates per verb as a means of zeroing in on which particular verb(s) the model was more successful in predicting. We can now examine the probability estimates that the polytomous logistic regression analysis assigns to each of the COME verbs per annotated context (4 verbs * 2,000 sentences).

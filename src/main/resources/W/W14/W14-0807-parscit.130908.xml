<bodyText confidence="0.997555125">
The proposed paper reports on work in progress
aimed at the development of a conceptual lexicon
of Modern Greek (MG) and the encoding of
MWEs in it. Morphosyntactic and semantic
properties of these expressions were specified
formally and encoded in the lexicon. The resulting
resource will be applicable for a number of NLP
applications.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99967485">
Substantial research in linguistics has been
devoted to the analysis and classification of
MWEs from different perspectives (Fraser, 1970;
Chomsky, 1980; M. Gross 1982, 1988; Ruwet,
1983; der Linden, 1992; Nunberg et al., 1994;
Howarth, 1996; Jackendoff, 1997; Moon, 1998;
Fellbaum, 2007). Moreover, cognitive and
psycholinguistic approaches to MWEs (Lakoff,
1993; Gibbs, 1998; Glucksberg, 1993;
Diakogiorgi&amp;Fotopoulou, 2012) have accounted
for their interpretation. Within the NLP
community, there is a growing interest in the
identification of MWEs and their robust
treatment, as this seems to improve parsing
accuracy (Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Arun and
Keller, 2005). In this respect, the development of
large-scale, robust language resources that may
be integrated in parsing systems is of paramount
importance. Representation, however, of MWEs
in lexica poses a number of challenges.

2 Basic Notions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99767575">
Typically, fixed MWEs are identified and
classified on the basis of semantic, lexical and
morphosyntactic criteria. (M. Gross, 1982, 1987;
Lamiroy, 2003), namely:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9829026">
• non-compositionality: i.e., the meaning of
the expression cannot be computed from
the meanings of its constituents and the
rules used to combine them. Nevertheless,
according to (Nunberg et al, 1994),
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.999083">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998811363636364">
compositionality refers to the fact that the
constituents of some idioms “carry
identifiable parts of the idiomatic
meaning”. Variability has been further
emphasised in (Hamblin and Gibbs 1999)
and (Nunberg et al. 1994): fixed
expressions appear in a continuum of
compositionality, which ranges from
expressions that are very analysable to
others that are partially analysable or
ultimately non-analysable.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99761">
• non-substitutability: at least one of the
expression constituents does not enter in
alternations at the paradigmatic axis
• non-modifiability: MWEs are syntactically
rigid structures, in that there are constraints
concerning modification, transformations,
etc.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999880357142857">
These criteria, however, do not apply in all
cases in a uniform way. The variability attested
brings about the notion ‘degree of fixedness’ (G.
Gross 1996). The kind and degree of fixedness
result in the classification of these expressions as
fixed, semi-fixed, syntactically flexible or
collocations (Sag et al, 2002). It is crucial for a
satisfactory MWEs representation in a
computational lexicon to provide an accurate and
functional formal modelling of fixedness,
variability and compositionality.
In this paper, we will discuss the classification
and encoding of compounds and fixed MWEs in
a conceptually organised lexicon of MG.

3 The conceptual lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972512096774194">
The conceptually organised lexicon that is under
development (Markantonatou &amp; Fotopoulou,
2007) capitalises on two basic notions: (a) the
notion of lexical fields, along with (b) the
Saussurian notion of sign and its two inseparable
facets, namely, the SIGNIFIER and the
SIGNIFIED as the building blocks (main classes)
of the underlying ontology.
Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2014), pages 43–47,
Gothenburg, Sweden, 26-27 April 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics
In this sense, the intended language resource is
a linguistic ontology in which words are
instances in the SIGNIFIER class. At this level,
morphological, syntactic and functional
information about lemmas is encoded. Similarly,
word meanings are instances in the SIGNIFIED
class. Each instance in the SIGNIFIER class is
mapped onto a concept, the latter represented as
an instance in the SIGNIFIED class.
The Instances of the class SIGNIFIER are
specified for (a) features pertaining to lexical
semantic relations (i.e, synonymy, antonymy);
(b) lexical relations such as word families,
allomorphs, syntactic variants etc.; and (c)
morphosyntactic properties (PoS, gender,
declension, argument structure, word specific
information etc.). Values for these features are
assigned to both single- and multi-word entries
in the lexicon. MWEs are further coupled with
rich linguistic information pertaining to the
lexical, syntactic and semantic levels.

4 Encoding MWEs in the lexicon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865636363636">
MWEs are encoded as instances in the
SIGNIFIER class of our ontology and are also
mapped onto the corresponding concepts or word
meanings (instances in the SIGNIFIED class).
In the remaining, we focus on the encoding of
MWEs as instances in the SIGNIFIER class. We
cater for sub-classes corresponding to
grammatical categories (verb, noun, adjective,
adverb, preposition, etc) under the class
SIGNIFIER in our schema. The class MWEs (as
opposed to the class Simple Lexical Units) has
been defined further under the verb, noun,
adjective and adverb sub-classes.
Syntactic configurations pertaining to each
class are also represented as distinct sub-classes
hierarchically organised under the verb, noun,
adjective and adverb classes. Morphosyntactic
properties, selectional preferences, and semantic
interpretation patterns are provided for each
MWE depending on the grammatical category it
pertains to; encoding is based on a set of
parameters represented as feature-value pairs.
More precisely, a typology of Greek verbal
MWEs has been defined in (Fotopoulou, 1993,
Mini, 2009) (NP V NP1 NP2...) and of nominal
MWEs in (Anastasiadis, 1986) (Adj N, NN...)
on the basis of the lexical and syntactic
configurations involved. This typology has been
mapped onto a hierarchy under classes verb and
noun).
In our approach, the main distinction between
collocations and fixed MWEs is made explicit.
The degree and type of fixedness are then
encoded as features. Further morphosyntactic
information is also encoded depending on the
grammatical category of the MWE (i.e.,
declension of one or more constituents,
only_singular or only_plural for nouns, etc.). In
this way, information that may be useful for the
automatic identification and interpretation of the
MWEs may be retained. Moreover, the standard
set of features inherited from the class
SIGNIFIER is also retained (PoS, Gender,
Number, Tense, synonyms, antonyms, etc.).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990015">
4.1. The encoding schema
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998853428571429">
We have so far implemented an encoding schema
for nominal and verbal MWEs. We aimed at
encoding rich linguistic knowledge in a formal
way that would be exploitable in computer
applications. The two types of fixedness
(collocations and fixed) are encoded as features:
(a) Lexical_variance, and (b) Is_actually.
The feature Lexical_variance1 has as possible
values (yes or no). Collocations (assigned a yes
value) are further specified with respect to
alternative lemmas; these lemmas are encoded in
the appropriate feature Variants. For instance, in
example (1) the two alternative lemmas are
Kαταστάσεις and περιστάσεις:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.634444">
(1) έKταKτες (Kαταστάσεις / περιστάσεις)
(=emergency (situations / circumstances))
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999396117647059">
The feature Is_actually (with possible values
yes or no) encodes information about the
interpretation pattern: a value yes signifies a
compositional or partially compositional
meaning; on the contrary, a value no denotes a
non-compositional interpretation (fixed
meaning).
Collocations are by default assigned feature
values corresponding to a compositional
meaning. In these cases, the feature
maintains_meaning further specifies the
constituent(s) that contribute to the non-fixed
interpretation of the expression. For example, the
meaning of the compound in (2) is retained from
the meaning of the first noun ταξίδι (=trip),
which, in turn, is the value assigned to the
maintains_meaning feature:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.999164666666667">
1In our MWE classification scheme, a lexical unit is
considered ‘fixed’ at the lemma level. This is because MG
is a heavily inflected language.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.997167">

</page>
<figure confidence="0.931724333333333">
(2) rαξίδι ασrρα7r4 (trip - lightning (=very
sudden and short trip)
&lt;maintains_meaning = rαξίδι /&gt;
</figure>
<figureCaption confidence="0.990465941176471">
Finally, the feature has_meta_meaning
signifies further the constituent(s) – if any –
bearing a figurative meaning. For example, the
compound rαξίδι ασrρα7r4 in (2) assumes the
figurative meaning of the second noun ασrρα7r4
(=very sudden and short-term).
On the contrary, verbal and nominal
expressions with a non-compositional meaning
are assigned a negative value (no) for the
Is_actually feature since their constituents do not
contribute to a compositional meaning; therefore,
the features maintains_meaning and
has_meta_meaning are left empty as non-
applicable. This is exemplified in (3) below; the
constituents 7rαιδικ4 (=kids’) and χαρά (=joy) of
the expression 7rαιδικ4 χαρά (=playground) do
not contribute to the overall interpretation:

<listItem confidence="0.468698666666667">

Furthermore, nominal MWEs are also assigned
values for features that are specific to the
nominal MWEs. Information on inflected
constituents - if any – is provided in the
declension feature; values for only_singular and
only_plural provide further morphological/usage
information; when used in combination with
other features (i.e, is_actually) this type of
information is evidence of fixedness. Frequent
co-occurrence patterns with verbs are provided in
the verb_combined feature; finally, alternative
nominalised forms are listed as values of the
feature nominalization. The schema is presented

4.3. Verbal MWEs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999338222222222">
In the typology adopted for the verbal idiomatic
expressions, fixedness can be limited to only
certain constituents of the sentence; a
combination of fixed and non-fixed constituents
in Subject or Object position is permitted. For
example, in sentences (4) and (5) below,
fixedness relies on the relation among the verbs
and the nouns that function as Objects (direct and
indirect) and as Subject respectively:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.556912">
(4) δίνro r67rοNP-acc, Obj σrην οργ4PP
to give way to anger (=to swallow one’s

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971540666666667">
my lights are switched on (=to become
very angry)
Moreover, the typology allows for a restricted
alternation of fixed elements of the expression.
For example, in the MWE in (6), the two
alternative lemmas are rάζro and υ7r6σχομαι:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.904985">
(6) rάζro / υ7r6σχομαι rον ουραν6 με r’ άσrρα
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7563938">
to undertake to offer / promise the sky with
the stars
This information is encoded in verbal MWEs,
namely: (a) the syntactic properties of the verb
that occurs in the expression (valency); and (b)
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998771">

<bodyText confidence="0.989385173913043">
fixed and non-fixed arguments either in Subject
or Object position. Moreover, selectional
restrictions applied to the arguments (such as +/-
human) are also added.
The encoding schema that applies to verbal
MWEs specifically is presented in Table 3. In
this schema, N signifies a non-fixed noun,
whereas C denotes a fixed one; number 0 (in N0
and C0) is used to represent a noun (either fixed
or non-fixed in Subject position), and 1, 2, 3, etc.
denote complements in Object position (or
complements of prepositional phrases). Other
features provide rich linguistic information
regarding facets of the expression in terms of: (a)
selectional restrictions (i.e., the features N0_type,
N1_type, etc., accept as values the semantic
category in which a noun in Subject or Object
position respectively, belongs to), (b) syntactic
alternations (i.e., Poss_Ppv encodes the
alternation among possessive and personal
pronoun), grammatical information (i.e.,
Ppv_case encodes the case of the personal
pronoun), etc.

5. Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999918">
As it has been shown above, in our lexicon we
have opted for an approach to MWE
representation that builds on rich linguistic
knowledge. The linguistic classifications adopted
deal with morphology, syntax, and semantics
interface aspects. Thus, a lexicon – grammar
representation of MWEs has been constructed by
encoding key morphosyntactic and semantic
information.The typology of verbal MWEs
shares common characteristics with similar
efforts for other languages (i.e, DuELME,
Gregoire, 2010 Morphosyntactic properties and
selectional preferences account better for a
number of phenomena, inherent in the Greek
language, as for example word order and gaps
attested in running text.
More specifically, Greek is a language with a
relatively free word order, and idiomatic
expressions often occur in texts in various
configurations. The encoding of fixed and non-
fixed constituents provides, therefore, extra
information for the identification of expressions
in texts. Moreover, the identification of MWEs
as collocations entails a relatively loose
fixedness, allowing, thus, for gaps and
discontinuities as shown in (7):

6. Conclusions and Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995068">
We have given an overview of the conceptual
lexicon currently under development and the
treatment of MWEs in it. We have so far treated
nominal and verbal MWEs (~1000 entries).
Future work involves the population of the
lexicon with new expressions also pertaining to
the grammatical categories adjective and adverb
and the definition of a fine-grained typology for
the latter. Moreover, a more granular
representation of fixedness will be attempted.
Compatibility of the resource with diverse
syntactic approaches will also be investigated.
The evaluation of the final resource will be
performed by integrating it in a tool that
automatically recognizes MWEs in texts.

Syntactic configurations pertaining to each class are also represented as distinct sub-classes hierarchically organised under the verb, noun, adjective and adverb classes. Morphosyntactic properties, selectional preferences, and semantic interpretation patterns are provided for each MWE depending on the grammatical category it pertains to; encoding is based on a set of parameters represented as feature-value pairs. More precisely, a typology of Greek verbal MWEs has been defined in (Fotopoulou, 1993, Mini, 2009) (NP V NP1 NP2...) and of nominal MWEs in (Anastasiadis, 1986) (Adj N, NN...) on the basis of the lexical and syntactic configurations involved. This typology has been mapped onto a hierarchy under classes verb and noun). In our approach, the main distinction between collocations and fixed MWEs is made explicit. The degree and type of fixedness are then encoded as features. Further morphosyntactic information is also encoded depending on the grammatical category of the MWE (i.e., declension of one or more constituents, only_singular or only_plural for nouns, etc.).

The variability attested brings about the notion ‘degree of fixedness’ (G. Gross 1996). The kind and degree of fixedness result in the classification of these expressions as fixed, semi-fixed, syntactically flexible or collocations (Sag et al, 2002). It is crucial for a satisfactory MWEs representation in a computational lexicon to provide an accurate and functional formal modelling of fixedness, variability and compositionality.

The kind and degree of fixedness result in the classification of these expressions as fixed, semi-fixed, syntactically flexible or collocations (Sag et al, 2002). It is crucial for a satisfactory MWEs representation in a computational lexicon to provide an accurate and functional formal modelling of fixedness, variability and compositionality. In this paper, we will discuss the classification and encoding of compounds and fixed MWEs in a conceptually organised lexicon of MG. 3 The conceptual lexicon The conceptually organised lexicon that is under development (Markantonatou &amp; Fotopoulou, 2007) capitalises on two basic notions: (a) the notion of lexical fields, along with (b) the Saussurian notion of sign and its two inseparable facets, namely, the SIGNIFIER and the SIGNIFIED as the building blocks (main classes) of the underlying ontology. Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2014), pages 43–47, Gothenburg, Sweden, 26-27 April 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics In this sense, the intended language resource is a linguistic ontology in which words are instances in the SIGNIFIER class. At this level, morphological, syntactic and functional</context>

Syntactic configurations pertaining to each class are also represented as distinct sub-classes hierarchically organised under the verb, noun, adjective and adverb classes. Morphosyntactic properties, selectional preferences, and semantic interpretation patterns are provided for each MWE depending on the grammatical category it pertains to; encoding is based on a set of parameters represented as feature-value pairs. More precisely, a typology of Greek verbal MWEs has been defined in (Fotopoulou, 1993, Mini, 2009) (NP V NP1 NP2...) and of nominal MWEs in (Anastasiadis, 1986) (Adj N, NN...) on the basis of the lexical and syntactic configurations involved. This typology has been mapped onto a hierarchy under classes verb and noun). In our approach, the main distinction between collocations and fixed MWEs is made explicit. The degree and type of fixedness are then encoded as features. Further morphosyntactic information is also encoded depending on the grammatical category of the MWE (i.e., declension of one or more constituents, only_singular or only_plural for nouns, etc.).

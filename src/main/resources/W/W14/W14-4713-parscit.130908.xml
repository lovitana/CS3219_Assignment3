<bodyText confidence="0.9999507">
Between simple electronic dictionaries such as the TLFi (computerized French Language
Treasure)1 and lexical networks like WordNet2 (Diller et al., 1990; Vossen, 1998), the lexical
databases are growing at high speed. Our work is about the addition of rich links to lexical
databases, in the context of the parallel development of lexical networks. Current research on
management tools for lexical databases is strongly influenced by the field of massive data
(&amp;quot;big data&amp;quot;) and by the Web of data (&amp;quot;linked data&amp;quot;). In lexical networks, one can build and use
arbitrary links, but possible queries cannot model all the usual interactions with
lexicographers-developers and users, that are needed, and derive from the paper world. Our
work aims to find a solution that allows for the main advantages of lexical networks, while
providing the equivalent of paper dictionaries by doing the lexicographic work in lexical DBs.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9996564">
The growing importance of IT in all human activities extends and expands the needs and usages of all
key digital resources that include lexical resources. Thus, while applications valuing the linguistic
processes rely on increasingly abstract representations, modelled for computer operations, it remains
that models coming from the historical construction of resources foster human understanding, and
therefore, the building of tools for studies centring on the humanities.
In this this section, we place the emergence of the concept of lexical database between electronic
dictionaries and lexical networks. We show that this concept is still valid, that it is still necessary to
enrich it, and that our work on improving tools for lexical databases helps solve real problems.
To do this, we analyse in the second section the evolution of lexical resources in 4 main steps
(simple electronic dictionaries, simple lexical databases, multilevel and multiversion lexical databases,
and lexical networks) and present the associated problems. In the third section, we present Jibiki-
LINKS, a platform for building multilingual lexical databases that enriches the Jibiki generic platform
by introducing the concept of rich link between the components it manages (dictionary entries and
dictionary volumes). Finally, we show that it allows the construction of lexical databases such as
Pivax-UNL, which support scaling up.

The first computerized lexical resources are electronic versions of printed dictionaries, mainly

regardless of their surface form, and thus of the language.
In this section, we present the evolution of approaches, distinguishing four main types of lexical
resources, the limitations that motivated this evolution, and the remaining hard problems.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.98378">
2.1 Simple electronic dictionaries
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999073125">
A simple electronic dictionary is an electronic version of a printed dictionary, or the computer
representation of a new kind of the same type of dictionary, for example, the TLFi4, the morphological
and bilingual dictionaries of Apertium5, etc. A simple electronic dictionary contains either one volume
or two volumes. The electronic version of a monolingual paper dictionary is (usually implicitly) based
on its microstructure, that is to say, on the organization of its entries in the form of a small tree
organizing the information it contains. In a paper dictionary, the presentation of an entry reflects the
microstructure, but the microstructure is not always directly retrievable from it (for example, parts in
italics can correspond to different types of information units, such as idiom or example of use).
In absolute terms, it is always possible to represent the information specified in each entry of a
dictionary according to a common structure. In reality, the structures of paper dictionaries are less
rigorous than what would be required for automatic processing, so that manual editing is required.
A bilingual paper dictionary is generally based on a structure in two volumes, one for each language
pair, each volume conforming to the same microstructure. There are therefore generally one volume
from language A (Lg A) to language B (Lg B) and a mirror volume from Lg B to Lg A. We define the
macrostructure of a dictionary as the organization of the volumes that make up its structure. These
macrostructures constitute the bulk of the printed dictionaries.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999439">
2.2 Lexical databases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999667823529412">
A lexical database is a tool for unifying any set of dictionaries, where each dictionary can be
monolingual, bilingual or multitarget. A multilingual lexical database is composed of volumes that are
monolingual, direct multilingual, or indirect multilingual, i.e. connecting the entries of different
languages via a pivot structure. It has an overall macrostructure, and a microstructure for each of its
volumes. A link between 2 entries is realized by the software tool as a direct link, or as 2 links going
through an intermediate language, or as a semantic link, etc.
The lack of symmetry of the correspondence between the entries of bilingual dictionaries (from
word senses to words, not word senses) led to the concept of interlingual pivot. In the pivot
macrostructure developed and used for the Papillon-NADIA multilingual lexical database (Serasset and
Mangeot, 2001), there is only one monolingual volume for each language. Lexies are word senses (of a
lexeme or an idiom) and make up the entries of these volumes. To group the lexies of different
languages together, there is a pivot volume of axies (interlingual acceptions). An axie connects
synonymous lexies. The links are established only between lexies and axies. This is the simplest
macrostructure for a pivot-based multilingual lexical resource that allows for the extraction of usage
dictionaries for all pairs in all directions. The concept of axie-based pivot structure has been validated
by the Papillon project and then included in the Lexical Markup Framework standard (Francopoulo et
al. 2009).

2.3 Multilevel and multiversion databases
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999148166666667">
In this type of lexical database, several monolingual volumes are allowed for each lexical space6, A
volume of axemes (monolingual acceptions) is introduced to link synonymous lexies of the considered
lexical space. Also, various levels are introduced to tag entries according to different points of view
(sublanguage, version, type of link, reliability, preference). The simple links of previous versions are
replaced by rich links that can be established not only between lexies, axemes and axies, but also
between entries and subentries, monolingually (lexicosemantic functions) or bilingually (translations).

6 A lexical space of a natural language contains various levels (wordform, lemma, lexie, prolexeme, proaxeme);
it can also contain the lexical symbols of an artificial semantic representation language (e.g., the UWs of UNL).
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.999517">

<bodyText confidence="0.99996275">
For example, there is a 3-level macrostructure (lexie, axeme, axie) in PIVAX (Nguyen &amp; al., 2007)
and a 4-level macrostructure (lexie, prolexeme, proaxie, axie) in ProAxie (Zhang &amp; Mangeot, 2013),
described in more detail in section 4.1. Both allow us to manage one or more monolingual volumes for
each lexical space. That has been quite useful in the ANR Traouiero GBDLex-UW++ subproject,
during which we stored the UNL part of many UNL-Li dictionaries (the UW interlingual lexemes,
built with slightly different conventions by different UNL groups for their languages), and tried then to
unify them in a new monolingual UNL dictionary (using a set of &amp;quot;UW++&amp;quot; built from WordNet and
from the previous UNL dictionaries).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996483">
2.4 Lexical network
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999935473684211">
A lexical network brings together the set of words that denote ideas or realities that refer to the same
theme, as well as all the words that, because of the context and certain aspects of their meaning, also
evoke this theme7. The theme may possibly be very broad. It is possible to represent the full
vocabulary of a language in a lexical network, such as, for French, the JeuxDeMots network
(Lafourcade and Joubert, 2010) or RFL (Lexical Network of French (Lux-Pogodalla, Polgu6re 2011)).
Lexical networks are traditionally represented as graphs. Nodes represent the lexemes of one or
more languages, and links represent the relationships between these lexemes (translation, synonymy,
etc.). A lexical network can be monolingual or multilingual. One can create syntactic, morphological
and semantic relations between lexemes.
Although lexical networks have many advantages, they are not suitable for all usages. For example,
lexical networks like WordNet (Diller &amp; al., 1990; Vossen, 1998), HowNet (Dong et al., 2010) and
MindNet (Dolan and Richardson, 1996) (Richardson et al., 1998) are not browsable in alphabetical
order. But we need that possibility to have an idea of the content of a lexical repository, whatever its
nature, or to play word games, or to find a word one has on the tip of the tongue8. On the other hand,
in a lexical network, the concept of volume is missing, which prevents to create a resource in a simple
way when studying a new language.
For example, the lexical network DBNary (S6rasset, 2012), which is based on the Lemon model
(McCrae et al., 2011), contains millions of terms, but does not allow labelling the links. To navigate in
this system, one must write SPARQL queries, which is not within the reach of everyone.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.902612">
2.5 Conclusion: features, limitations and hard problems
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951375">
Research efforts focus today mainly on lexical networks, but much remains to be done on the
preceding types (pivot, multilevel). In particular, the import of lexical databases in lexical networks
causes a loss of information, especially information born by the attributes of rich links. For example,
what concerns the history, the etymology or the evolution of word senses is not systematically
imported into lexical networks. They therefore cannot meet the needs of the humanities, nor allow the
transition to &amp;quot;digital humanities.&amp;quot;
A lexical network is actually the type of structure that enables the greatest freedom of
representation. Indeed, we can create entries and links arbitrarily. But the possible queries cannot
model all the usual interactions with lexicographers-developers and users, which come from the world
of paper, and are felt necessary. They allow us to represent all categories of lexical resources, but the
analogy with the real world is lost. Thus, the practical expertise of linguists-lexicographers is lost.
We must continue to equip lexical databases, because that is the right level to transfer the
techniques used by lexicographers-linguists. Also, modelling by a volume-based macrostructure
allows keeping a link to the original paper world. Moreover, there are already reusable resources of
these types. That is why we focus on the management of resources having multiversion and multilevel
macrostructures.

3.1 Presentation of the Jibiki platform
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967461538462">
Jibiki is a generic platform that enables the construction of contributive websites dedicated to the
construction of multilingual lexical databases. That platform has been developed mainly by Mathieu
Mangeot (Mangeot &amp; Chalvin, 2006) and Gilles S6rasset (S6rasset &amp; Mangeot, 2001). It has been
used in various projects (EU LexALP project, Papillon project, GDEF project, etc.). The code is
available in open source, and freely downloadable by SVN from ligforge.imag.fr. With this platform,
one can perform import, export, edit and search operations in lexical databases. One can also manage
the contributions. Jibiki allows handling almost all lexical resources of XML type, by using different
microstructures and macrostructures.
In the Jibiki approach, resources are organized in volumes, which makes it easier to achieve the
equivalent of paper dictionaries, keeping the mental image of the representation of the dictionary,
while offering new interactions allowed in the digital world. Usages of dictionaries in Jibiki are also
similar to those of paper dictionaries. For example, one can consult a database in alphabetical order,
indicate a source and/or target language, group lexies in vocables, navigate in a volume, etc.

3.2 Classical Common Dictionary Markup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999734">
Version 1 of Jibiki uses &amp;quot;CDM pointers&amp;quot; (Common Dictionary Markup (Mangeot, 2002)) to import,
view and edit any type of microstructure without modifying it. CDM pointers are also used to index
specific parts of the information, and then allow a multi-criteria search.
Each CDM pointer indicates the path (XPath) to the corresponding element in the XML
microstructure of the described resource (see Figure 1). Its description is stored in a XML metadata
file. When the resource is imported in the Jibiki platform, the pointers are computed, and the result is
stored in a table of the (postgresql) database, for each volume. This table is considered as an indexing
table.

The translation links are treated at this stage with conventional CDM pointers, as classical
information elements. It is not possible to index other information carried by the links, such as weights
or labels.
Hence, multilevel macrostructures cannot be modelled in a generic manner with Jibiki-v1 and
traditional CDM pointers. For example, it is not possible to link the same volume to several volumes at
different levels. This has forced us initially to use palliatives that did not scale up. It became necessary
to modify the conceptual model. We addressed these shortcomings in a new version, Jibiki-LINKS.
Table 1 above is an example of CDM for the different resources.

3.3 New version of Jibiki with CDM LINKS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9950885">
To manage multilevel macrostructures, we enriched the CDM with a richer description of the links (see
Figure 2). For each link, more information can be indexed:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999564692307692">
â€¢ the identifier of the source entry.
â€¢ the identifier of the target entry.
â€¢ the identifier of the XML element of the source entry containing the link. For example, the
sense number in a polysemous entry having a translation link for each translation direction.
That allows us to precisely retrieve the origin of the link.
â€¢ the link name. It is used to distinguish between different types of links in a single entry, such
as a translation link and a synonymy link.
â€¢ the target language (three-letter code ISO 639-2 / T).
â€¢ the target volume.
â€¢ the type of link. Some types are predefined, because they are used by the algorithms that
compute the rich links (translation, axeme, axie), but it is possible to use other types of links.
â€¢ a label whose text is arbitrary.
â€¢ a weight whose value must be a real number.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999339">
These links can be established between two entries of the same volume or between two different
volumes. The same volume may group entries connected to several volumes.
To realize the implementation of rich links, we separated the module processing the links from the
module processing other CDM pointers. It means we have two CDM tables in the database associated
to each volume. The first stores CDM traditional pointers, and the second CDM LINKS. All
information of LINKS can be found in this table.

3.4 Approach by rich links in searching in a complex lexical network

<bodyText confidence="0.999828166666667">
To explain how we create arbitrary links, let us give an example. A free label is available for each link.
For example, in a lexical resource including SMS, in French &amp;quot;A+&amp;quot; has a link to &amp;quot;Over&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;SMS&amp;quot;
label, in English &amp;quot;L8R&amp;quot; corresponds to &amp;quot;later&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;SMS&amp;quot; label, and the label of the link between
&amp;quot;Over&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;later&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;translation.&amp;quot;
A ProAxie macrostructure (Zhang &amp; Mangeot, 2013) has been implemented on the Jibiki-Links

4.1 Examples of multilevel macrostructures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999557529411765">
We have already installed several multilevel macrostructures on Jibiki-LINKS. Here are 3 examples.
MotÃ‹Mot: trilingual lexical database with a pivot structure (Mangeot &amp; Touche, 2010)
This project (2009-2012) has computerized a French-Khmer classical dictionary, initially in Word,
into a Jibiki database (see http://jibiki.univ-savoie.fr/motamot/).
The macrostructure is composed of a monolingual volume for each language and a central pivot
volume. However, in order not to confuse users, the contributing interface shows a classic view of
a bilingual dictionary. Each bilingual link language A - language B added via this interface is actually
translated into the background by creating two interlingual links as well as an axie link representing
the original translation, to finally get: language A - pivot axie - language B (see Figure 3).
If a contributor wants to add a translation link between a vocable Va of language A and a vocable
Vb of language B, s/he can establish this link at different levels. The ideal solution is to connect a
word meaning (lexie) La of the vocable Va to another word meaning Lb of the vocable Vb. In this case,
the link is bijective and Lb is also connected to La.
If the contributor cannot choose between word meanings, s/he can connect directly the word
meaning La to the vocable Vb and the link is tagged for refinement.
With the pivot macrostructure, if two links language A - language B and language B - language C
exist, then it will automatically create a link language A - language C tagged for refinement.

ProAxie: multilingual extension of ProxlexBase (Tran, 2006)
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99946775">
The ProAxie macrostructure aims at solving the problem of linking several terms that refer to one
and the same referent, in particular for the management of acronyms (Zhang et Mangeot, 2013). In this
macrostructure, there are two different layers. The base layer consists of two types of volume:
volumes of lexies and volumes of axies. The axies are used to connect the lexies that match each other
exactly. For example, one translates &amp;quot;ONU&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;UN&amp;quot; (see Figure 4) from French into English.
The &amp;quot;Pro&amp;quot; layer allows us to propose to users translations having the same referential meanings.
This layer includes the volumes of prolexemes (Tran, 2006) and one volume of proaxies. A prolexeme
entry links lexies having the same meaning with a label (aka, acronym, definition, etc.). A proaxie
entry connects prolexemes of different languages. If one cannot find the translations directly using the
lower layer, one will get the translations proposed by the &amp;quot;Pro&amp;quot; layer.
For example, for &amp;quot;Nations-Unies&amp;quot;, translations by &amp;quot;United Nations&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;UN&amp;quot; will be proposed,
with the &amp;quot;alias&amp;quot; label.

For each natural language, there are one or more volumes of lexies, and a single volume of
prolexemes. For each dictionary, there is a volume of axies and a volume of proaxies.
This gives three levels of translation, classified according to the precision obtained.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9854615">
(1) The system finds a lexie directly, using the volume of axies. That is the first and most accurate
level of translation.
(2) The system searches a link to the prolexemes volume of the source language with a certain label.
When it finds the link in the proaxies volume, it follows the prolexeme link of the target language, and
finally arrives at the volume of lexies in the target language, and finds a lexie that has the same label.
That is the second, intermediate level.
(3) The system finds the lexies going through prolexemes and proaxies, without a corresponding
label. These proposed lexies constitute the third and least accurate level.

Pivax: lexical multilingual multiversion database with 3 levels
The Pivax macrostructure has three levels: lexie, axeme and axie (Nguyen &amp; al., 2007). Axemes are
monolingual acceptions, and group monolingual lexies having the same meaning. Axies group
synonymous axemes of different languages in a central &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot;. In some situations, a lexical database
has several volumes for a single language. For example, when there are several editions, or when the
lexical resource is created for a machine translation system: one may have one volume coming from
Systran, one from Ariane/Heloâ€¢se, one from IATE13, etc. This macrostructure allows us to manage
multiple volumes in the same language. Given a language, there are one or more volumes of lexies and
a single volume of axemes. For any Pivax database, there is only one volume of axies. The links
between the lexies and the axemes and between the axemes and the axies are rich links with attributes
such as type, target volume, target language, free label, weight, etc.

volume structure using oXygen. In this example, each volume contains a large quantity of vocables,
and each vocable includes one or more lexie. We will explain this structure in section 3.2.3.

CommonUNLDict contains 8 languages (7 natural languages, French, English, Hindi, Malay,
Russian, Spanish, Vietnamese, and the UNL language) and 17 volumes (8 volumes of monolingual
data, 8 volumes of monolingual axemes, and 1 volume of axies (&amp;quot;interlingual meanings&amp;quot;). The
macrostructure of CommonUNLDict is diagrammed in Figure 6. For each language, there is only one
volume of monolingual data (vocables and lexical items) and a single volume of axemes. For the
whole CommonUNLDict, there is only one volume of axies.

The microstructure is the structure of the entries (Mangeot, 2001). In the CommonUNLDict
resource, there are three types of entries (vocables, axemes and axies) and 720 K entries in total.

All volumes of the same type have the same microstructure. The example below (see Figure 7)
shows the microstructure of a volume of vocables. Each entry of vocable type allows us to describe all
detailed information, such as part of speech (POS), pronunciation, etc. Each vocable includes one or
more lexies (word senses). Figure 2 shows an example. Therefore the number of axemes is greater
than or equal to the number of vocables. In this microstructure, the &amp;quot;entryref&amp;quot; attribute allows us to
manage the links between lexies and the entries of axeme type.

Response time and use case
The tests were performed with an instance of Jibiki-LINKS installed on a machine with an Intel Core
i3 processor at 3.3 GHz with 8 GB of RAM.
The tool used to perform queries is wget. The command is run directly on the server to avoid the
latency due to the network. We give three examples in Table 3, which show the number of links
computed by the system, of entries displayed, of queries, of different languages, and the average
response time. The response time, less than 1 second in these cases, is generally satisfactory. For better
understanding, there is some details about the example &amp;quot;manger&amp;quot; (see Figure 8). We search &amp;quot;manger&amp;quot;
in French, and find one entry with id &amp;quot;fra.manger.v&amp;quot; in the French vocable volume. The search
direction is &amp;quot;up&amp;quot;. This entry links to another entry of the volume of French axemes, whose id is
CommonUNLDict.axeme.fra.eat(icl&gt;consume&gt;do, agt&gt;living_thing, obj&gt;concrete_thing, ins&gt;thing)15.
This axeme entry links with one axie entry and the vocable entry fra.manger.v. Because the search
direction is &amp;quot;up&amp;quot;, we just go to the axie entry. When we arrive in the volume of axies, the search
direction is changed to &amp;quot;down&amp;quot;. The axie entry links to 6 different axeme entries. We search each
axeme entry and its links. Because the search direction is &amp;quot;down&amp;quot;, we only take into account vocable
entries links. For each axeme entry, we find at least one vocable entry. In other cases, one vocable
entry has more than one lexie, so it links to one or several axeme entries, and there are more links.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99820775">
In this article, we analysed the different types of lexical resource and presented a method of modelling
lexical resources using volumes. This method allows us to manage complex resources while providing
facilities for manipulation and treatment equivalent to those of a paper dictionary.
Jibiki-LINKS is a new version of the Jibiki platform, which can manage resources based on multilevel
macrostructures using rich links, bearing attributes such as target volume, weight, type, language, open
label, etc. To realize the implementation of rich links, we separated the module processing the links
from the module processing other CDM pointers. Jibiki-LINKS has been used to implement the
MotÃ‹Mot, ProAxie and Pivax macrostructures.
On the Pivax-UNL platform, another instance of the Jibiki-LINKS-based Pivax macrostructure, we
have installed the volumes corresponding to the CommonUNLDict resource of V. Dikonov, and tested
our platform with that resource.
There is also a UW (UNL interlingual lexemes) resource of 8G entries that was created from
DBpedia by David Rouquet. In that resource, there are several volumes for the same language. As
links were poorly structured, we are currently working on this resource in order to recompute them.
We hope to be able to import this resource, and to make tests at that very large scale in the near future.
To sum up, lexical databases equipped with rich links allow for importing XML-based electronic
dictionaries without loss of information, whether they have been elaborated from source or printable
forms (such as Word, rtf, ps, pdf) or directly produced in XML from a relational database, or using a
dedicated editor knowing their microstructures. They also allow us to automatically produce from
them a pivot-based macrostructure organised in volumes, and after that to edit and improve them,
using a mixed textual and graphical interface to merge or split lexies, axemes or axies, or to enrich the
links with appropriate labels. The introduction of rich links to multilevel lexical databases enhances
them with a very interesting aspect of the lexical networks while keeping the classical ways of using
dictionaries and of performing lexicographic work.

<abstract confidence="0.999678454545455">simple electronic dictionaries such as the French Language and lexical networks like (Diller et al., 1990; Vossen, 1998), the lexical databases are growing at high speed. Our work is about the addition of rich links to lexical databases, in the context of the parallel development of lexical networks. Current research on management tools for lexical databases is strongly influenced by the field of massive data (&amp;quot;big data&amp;quot;) and by the Web of data (&amp;quot;linked data&amp;quot;). In lexical networks, one can build and use arbitrary links, but possible queries cannot model all the usual interactions with lexicographers-developers and users, that are needed, and derive from the paper world. Our work aims to find a solution that allows for the main advantages of lexical networks, while providing the equivalent of paper dictionaries by doing the lexicographic work in lexical DBs.</abstract>

To group the lexies of different languages together, there is a pivot volume of axies (interlingual acceptions). An axie connects synonymous lexies. The links are established only between lexies and axies. This is the simplest macrostructure for a pivot-based multilingual lexical resource that allows for the extraction of usage dictionaries for all pairs in all directions. The concept of axie-based pivot structure has been validated by the Papillon project and then included in the Lexical Markup Framework standard (Francopoulo et al. 2009). 2.3 Multilevel and multiversion databases In this type of lexical database, several monolingual volumes are allowed for each lexical space6, A volume of axemes (monolingual acceptions) is introduced to link synonymous lexies of the considered lexical space. Also, various levels are introduced to tag entries according to different points of view (sublanguage, version, type of link, reliability, preference).

The theme may possibly be very broad. It is possible to represent the full vocabulary of a language in a lexical network, such as, for French, the JeuxDeMots network (Lafourcade and Joubert, 2010) or RFL (Lexical Network of French (Lux-Pogodalla, Polgu6re 2011)). Lexical networks are traditionally represented as graphs. Nodes represent the lexemes of one or more languages, and links represent the relationships between these lexemes (translation, synonymy, etc.). A lexical network can be monolingual or multilingual. One can create syntactic, morphological and semantic relations between lexemes. Although lexical networks have many advantages, they are not suitable for all usages. For example, lexical networks like WordNet (Diller &amp; al., 1990; Vossen, 1998), HowNet (Dong et al., 2010) and</context>

An important point is that these links may bear arbitrary labels. 3.1 Presentation of the Jibiki platform Jibiki is a generic platform that enables the construction of contributive websites dedicated to the construction of multilingual lexical databases. That platform has been developed mainly by Mathieu Mangeot (Mangeot &amp; Chalvin, 2006) and Gilles S6rasset (S6rasset &amp; Mangeot, 2001). It has been used in various projects (EU LexALP project, Papillon project, GDEF project, etc.). The code is available in open source, and freely downloadable by SVN from ligforge.imag.fr. With this platform, one can perform import, export, edit and search operations in lexical databases. One can also manage the contributions. Jibiki allows handling almost all lexical resources of XML type, by using different microstructures and macrostructures. In the Jibiki approach, resources are organized in volumes, which makes it easier to achieve the equiv</context>

It has an overall macrostructure, and a microstructure for each of its volumes. A link between 2 entries is realized by the software tool as a direct link, or as 2 links going through an intermediate language, or as a semantic link, etc. The lack of symmetry of the correspondence between the entries of bilingual dictionaries (from word senses to words, not word senses) led to the concept of interlingual pivot. In the pivot macrostructure developed and used for the Papillon-NADIA multilingual lexical database (Serasset and Mangeot, 2001), there is only one monolingual volume for each language. Lexies are word senses (of a lexeme or an idiom) and make up the entries of these volumes. To group the lexies of different languages together, there is a pivot volume of axies (interlingual acceptions). An axie connects synonymous lexies. The links are established only between lexies and axies. This is the simplest macrostructure for a pivot-based multilingual lexical resource that allows for the extraction of usage dictionaries for all pairs in all directions. The concept of axie-based pivot structure has been validated by the Papillo</context>

If the contributor cannot choose between word meanings, s/he can connect directly the word meaning La to the vocable Vb and the link is tagged for refinement.

In this macrostructure, there are two different layers. The base layer consists of two types of volume: volumes of lexies and volumes of axies. The axies are used to connect the lexies that match each other exactly. For example, one translates &amp;quot;ONU&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;UN&amp;quot; (see Figure 4) from French into English.

Both allow us to manage one or more monolingual volumes for each lexical space. That has been quite useful in the ANR Traouiero GBDLex-UW++ subproject, during which we stored the UNL part of many UNL-Li dictionaries (the UW interlingual lexemes, built with slightly different conventions by different UNL groups for their languages), and tried then to unify them in a new monolingual UNL dictionary (using a set of &amp;quot;UW++&amp;quot; built from WordNet and from the previous UNL dictionaries). 2.4 Lexical network A lexical network brings together the set of words that</context>

<bodyText confidence="0.999102151515152">
The 10th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE 2014) took place on April 26 and 27, 2014
in Gothenburg, Sweden in conjunction with the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the
Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2014) and was endorsed by the Special Interest
Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics (SIGLEX), as well as
SIGLEX’s Section dedicated to the study and research of Multiword Expressions (SIGLEX-MWE).
Moreover, this year’s edition of the MWE workshop was also supported by the IC1207 COST1
action PARSEME2 dedicated to Parsing and Multiword Expressions. This European initiative, which
started in 2013, gathers 29 European COST member countries, one COST cooperating state and
3 non-COST institutions from the USA and Brazil. Its objective is to increase and enhance the
information and communication technology support of the European multilingual heritage by bringing
about a substantial progress in the understanding and modelling of MWEs within advanced multilingual
NLP techniques, notably deep parsing. The special track of the MWE 2014 workshop endorsed by
PARSEME gathered 8 papers where links between lexical and grammatical aspects of MWEs, as well
as their role in deep parsing and NLP applications, such as machine translation, were addressed.
The workshop has been held almost every year since 2003 in conjunction with ACL, EACL, NAACL,
COLING and LREC. It provides an important venue for interaction, sharing of resources and tools and
collaboration efforts for advancing the computational treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs),
attracting the attention of an ever-growing community working on a variety of languages and MWE
types.
MWEs include idioms (storm in a teacup, sweep under the rug), fixed phrases (in vitro, by and large,
rock’n roll), noun compounds (olive oil, laser printer), compound verbs (take a nap, bring about),
among others. These, while easily mastered by native speakers, are a key issue and a current weakness
for natural language parsing and generation, as well as real-life applications depending on some degree
of semantic interpretation, such as machine translation, just to name a prominent one among many.
However, thanks to the joint efforts of researchers from several fields working on MWEs, significant
progress has been made in recent years, especially concerning the construction of large-scale language
resources. For instance, there is a large number of recent papers that focus on acquisition of MWEs
from corpora, and others that describe a variety of techniques to find paraphrases for MWEs. Current
methods use a plethora of tools such as association measures, machine learning, syntactic patterns, web
queries, etc.
In the call for papers we solicited submissions about major challenges in the overall process of MWE
treatment, both from the theoretical and the computational viewpoint, focusing on original research
related (but not limited) to the following topics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995829916666667">
• Manually and automatically constructed resources
• Representation of MWEs in dictionaries and ontologies
• MWEs and user interaction
iv
• Multilingual acquisition
• Multilingualism and MWE processing
• Models of first and second language acquisition of MWEs
• Crosslinguistic studies on MWEs
• The role of MWEs in the domain adaptation of parsers
• Integration of MWEs into NLP applications
• Evaluation of MWE treatment techniques
• Lexical, syntactic or semantic aspects of MWEs
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.985613">
Submission modalities included Long Papers and Short Papers. From a total of 36 submissions, 14
were long papers and 22 were short papers, and we accepted 6 long papers for oral presentation and
2 as posters. We further accepted 6 short papers for oral presentation and 8 as posters. The overall
acceptance rate is 58%. The workshop also featured 3 invited talks.

We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for the timely reviews and the authors
for their valuable contributions. We also want to thank PARSEME which funded travel and stay for at
least 20 participants from the Action’s member countries.

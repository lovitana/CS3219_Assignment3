We introduce a novel task, that of associ-
ating relative time with cities in text. We
show that the task can be performed using
NLP tools and techniques. The task is de-
ployed on a large corpus of data to study a
specific phenomenon, namely the tempo-
ral dimension of contemporary arts glob-
alization over the first decade of the 21st

This paper reports on the use of fairly simple Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP) technology as a
tool for social research. We seek to understand the
globalization of contemporary art, relying on re-
leases for art events worldwide over the period of
1999-2012. A first phase of the project exploited
Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to extract cities
named in the corpus.
In this second phase of the research, we turn
our attention to a novel task: the temporal dimen-
sion captured in these texts. By identifying the
timing of geographically-cited events, we are able
to examine how the history and projected future
of the art world evolve alongside, and as a result
of, its current geographical structure. To deter-
mine whether cities named in press releases re-
fer to events that occur in the past, the present,
or the future, we need methods for resolving time
expressed in text relative to the time of the re-
lease of the text. We use the Stanford Temporal
TaggerSUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012), as
well as rules we have built on top of the Stanford
part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), to
identify the temporal referent of each city men-
tioned. The two systems in combination perform
slightly better than either does alone, and at a high

data for network analysis. We start by describing
the project in more detail in Section 2, as well as
the data we use in Section 3. Section 4 discusses
our method for identifying the temporal location
of named events. The networks we build using this
data afford some preliminary insights into the dy-
namics of contemporary arts globalization, which
we present in Section 5. Our aim here is not, how-
ever, to offer definitive conclusions about change
in the art world. Rather, we present these analyses
as proof of concept to demonstrate how a novel
NLP task can help advance a particular agenda in
social research.

2 The Goals of the Project
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955681818182">
The shifting geography of contemporary art is of
interest to social scientists as an instance of cul-
tural globalization (Bourdieu, 1999; Crane, 2008).
Scholars and contemporary art practitioners alike
have remarked on changes in the geography of
globally-significant art activity in recent decades
(Vanderlinden and Filipovic, 2005; McAndrew,
2008; Quemin, 2006). Accounts of these dy-
namics often converge: for example, many have
pointed to the role that speculation in the art of
the developing world plays in fragmenting the
once geographically-concentrated field of contem-
porary art (e.g., (Lee, 2012; Stallabrass, 2006)).
Such claims remain largely a matter of conjecture,
however, having never been subjected to system-
atic empirical scrutiny.
Because of the difficulties of compiling appro-
priate data, contemporary arts globalization has
rarely been studied using quantitative methods.
The few quantitative analyses that exist focus on
particular cities (Velthius, 2013), individual artists
(Buchholz, forthcoming), or a particular category

of art-related events, for example fairs (Quemin,
2013). Our project relies on NLP techniques to
solve the problems of data collection that have
limited previous research endeavors. We extract
information from a large and growing corpus of
press releases for contemporary art events occur-
ring worldwide. An initial phase of the project re-
vealed for the first time an object that has resisted
empirical description: the contemporary global art
world. The research was able to track changes in
the art worlds geographic structure over the period
of 2001 until 2012. Named Entity Recognition
(NER) was used to identify cities mentioned in
the body text of announcements as the location of
other significant contemporary art events. Pooling
documents over a given time window yielded a dy-
namic network of cities, enabling the researchers
to track the evolution of the art world. The analysis
revealed that a distinct central core of cities all in
Europe and North America enjoyed a remarkably
stable ranking as top art locales over the period;
however, as the art world expanded, connection to
these capitals became less important as an entry to
the art world for locations outside the global north
(Rule and Brandt, 2013).
“The city that I believed was my past, is my
future, my present; the years I have spent in Eu-
rope are an illusion, I always was (and will be)
in Buenos Aires” (Borges, 1978). Borges’ re-
marks capture a paradox about places of signifi-
cance: important places are places where impor-
tant things have happened and will happen–but
this is so from the viewpoint of the present, which
is always evolving. This insight implies that in
order to understand the dynamics shaping the ge-
ography of significant art activity, analysts need
to disentangle the real time in which attributions
of significance to locations occur, from the rela-
tive timing of the events that make them signifi-
cant. The current phase of our research attempts
to assess how the geographical evolution of the
art world shapes contemporary arts history and its
projected future. It does so by considering how
events mentioned in the corpus are located in time,
relative to the event in question. We build upon the
NER-based strategy developed in Phase 1 for iden-
tifying cities as the location of important events.
Here, however, we distinguish cities as the loca-
tion of events in the past, present, or future.

biennials across Europe, Asia and the Americas includ-
ing Manifesta 8, the Third Moscow Biennale and Shar-
jah Biennial. His work is the subject of a major mono-
graph, Laurent Grasso: The Black-Body Radiation (Les
Presses du Reel, 2009). As the 2008 Laureate of the

hibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou (2009). Gras-
sos work is currently on view at La Maison Rouge in
Paris in an exhibition of the Olbricht Collection; forth-

3 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995833333333">
We draw on corpus of press releases for con-
temporary art events worldwide, distributed over
the premier email digest service for contemporary
art. The digest serves a professional clientele, and
sends out 3-5 press releases a day. These emails
are free to the digest’s 90,000 subscribers (com-
pare to Artforum’s circulation of 35,000). Press
releases are both written and paid for by the insti-
tutions sponsoring the events they announce. The
corpus covers the years 1999 to 2012; it contains
10,566 documents and 6362284. Our automated
detection, checked by human annotators, identi-
fied 1007 unique cities.
We conceive of each press release as an attempt
to raise the status of the event in question by men-
tioning other high-status events to which it is re-
lated. Pooling the references of cities across doc-
uments thus gives rise to a network, analogous to
a citation network. The press releases are rather
conventionalized, and name cities almost exclu-
sively as the location of important related events.
The format is not just used by this particular digest
service, but is common to the art world generally.
A sample is shown in Figure 1.

pressions in dates, time durations, holidays, etc.
The second approach uses verbal tense to resolve
grammaticized reference to time. In both ap-
proaches: (1) We use distance within a sentence
as a heuristic to associate a temporal expression
to a city. (2) Cities associated with art events are
tagged as past, current or future, where current
is the default tag. This section describes both ap-
proaches and how they can be combined to en-
hance the performance.

4.1 Explicit Lexical Temporal Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995">
Explicit temporal expressions could be partial or
complete dates (Jan-01, March 2nd, 2014), spe-
cific named days (Christmas 2001), deictic time
expressions (last Wednesday), time durations (the
past five years), seasons (next fall), etc.
We use the Stanford Temporal Tagger, SUTime
(Chang and Manning, 2012) to detect and evaluate
Temporal expressions relative to the publication
date of the press release. Temporal expressions
that evaluate to incomplete dates take on the miss-
ing date components from the publication date. If
the temporal expression resolves to a date before,
same as or after the publication date, then the event
associated with the city is tagged as past, current,
or future event respectively. Cities that are not
associated with explicit temporal expressions are
given the default tag: current.

4.2 Grammaticized Temporal Expressions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999854823529412">
Tense is grammaticalization of location in time
(Comrie, 1985). Our tense-based approach has
two steps. First, the Stanford part-of-speech tag-
ger (Toutanova et al., 2003) is used to identify the
POS tags of all tokens in the documents. Second,
we use hand-written rules to identify the tempo-
ral interpretation of every event. The rules are
mostly based on the POS tags of verbs; we use
the tag sets from the Penn Treebank Project (Mar-
cus et al., 1993). We use only the verbal tags:
VB (Verb, base form), VBD (Verb, past tense),
VBG (Verb, gerund or present participle), etc. and
MD (Modal). Here are some examples of the
rules; events associated with: (1) VBP or VBZ are
tagged as current. (2) VBD are tagged as past. (3)
VB that are preceded by will/MD are tagged as fu-
ture.

4.3 Results and Combining of the Two
Approaches
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852518518519">
During development, we found that the two time
tagging approaches perform well in different situ-
ations. For example, the lexical approach has the
higher recall (66.1%) for past event as writers of-
ten mention the exact date of past events. How-
ever, in the case of current events dates are seldom
mentioned, the present tense is enough to com-
municate that the event mentioned in a sentence
is ongoing. This accounts for the higher recall of
the grammaticized (89%) as against the lexical ap-
proach (75.5%) for current events. If we do not as-
sign current by default to the failed cases in both
the lexical and grammaticized approaches, the re-
call for current events drops drastically for the lex-
ical approach (75.5% \ 0.69%) compared to the
grammaticized approaches (89% \ 81.5%).
Combining the two approaches improves the
performance of the time tagging task. We start
with one approach to tag an event and when
that approach fails (does not provide an answer),
the other approach kicks in. If both approaches
fail, the event is tagged by default as current.
For example, in approach GrammaticizedLexical
(GL), when the Grammaticized approach fails
to tag an event, the Lexical approach is used.
The best combination is achieved by running the
LexicalGrammaticized (LG) first; if the output tag

is past, accept its answer; otherwise run the
GrammaticizedLexical system (GL) and accept its
verdict. If GL has no answer, choose present. The
accuracy of this approach is 78.0%. For more de-
tails, see table 1. Please note that analyses in sec-
tion 5 rely on the GrammaticizedLexical (GL) ap-
proach.

5 Creation and Interpretation of
Networks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954696969697">
To analyze the geography of the art world, we
generated networks of events in relative time over
three four-year periods: 2001-2004; 2005-2008;
and 2009-2012. Nodes represent cities named as
the location of art events, and edges co-citations
from a particular geographical and temporal stand-
point. Specifically, we attribute ties between cities
of the past, present or future of a given period
when they are mentioned together in press releases
for events currently occurring in the same city.
Ties are weighted to reflect the number of co-
mentions. For example, if Basel is noted twice as
a future event location by press releases for events
in New York, and LA is mentioned by New York
press releases three times, the edge between Basel
and LA receives an edge weight of 2, reflecting the
number of shared mentions.
Basic properties of the nine resulting networks
are displayed in table 2. Notice the marked differ-
ence in the distribution of events in relative time
between 2005-2008 and 2009-2012. Cities men-
tioned in connection with events in both the future
and the past figure as a greater proportion of the
total in the last, as compared to the middle period.
Though we consider the possibility that this is an
artifact of the data, it seems more to likely that
the shift reflects the impact of a real world devel-
opment: namely, the global economic recession,
which began in 2008 and had profound effect on
funding for contemporary art. In the context of
the economic contraction, it seems that both con-
temporary arts future and its history become more
important relative to its present.

Figure 2 shows the network of future events
arising from 2009-2012. Recall that the graph
captures the world’s future, as it is structured by
the geography of significant art world activity dur-
ing this period. Just as in Borges remarks about
Buenos Aires, we observe here how important
places in the art worlds present shape the map of
its future.
This graph suggests an art world that is rather
conservative, more so, at least, than accounts of
the speculation driving its globalization would im-
ply. The network exhibits a classic core-periphery
structure; the cities at its center are the ”big” art
capitals of the global north: London, New York,
Berlin, Paris, Venice. In other words, the com-
mon proposition that the “hype” around emerging
art markets has de-centered the contemporary art
world is not borne out by a close empirical exami-
nation from the perspective of the hype-generators
themselves. Rather, it would seems that the role
of these cities as the prime location for contem-
porary art in the present enables them to project
themselves as the location of significant art activ-
ity in the future.

By identifying the timing of geographically-cited events, we are able to examine how the history and projected future of the art world evolve alongside, and as a result of, its current geographical structure. To determine whether cities named in press releases refer to events that occur in the past, the present, or the future, we need methods for resolving time expressed in text relative to the time of the release of the text. We use the Stanford Temporal TaggerSUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012), as well as rules we have built on top of the Stanford part-of-speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), to identify the temporal referent of each city mentioned.

(2) Cities associated with art events are tagged as past, current or future, where current is the default tag. This section describes both approaches and how they can be combined to enhance the performance. 4.1 Explicit Lexical Temporal Expressions Explicit temporal expressions could be partial or complete dates (Jan-01, March 2nd, 2014), specific named days (Christmas 2001), deictic time expressions (last Wednesday), time durations (the past five years), seasons (next fall), etc. We use the Stanford Temporal Tagger, SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) to detect and evaluate Temporal expressions relative to the publication date of the press release. Temporal expressions that evaluate to incomplete dates take on the missing date components from the publication date. If the temporal expression resolves to a date before, same as or after the publication date, then the event associated with the city is tagged as past, current, or future event respectively. Cities that are not associated with explicit temporal expressions are given the default tag: current. 4.2 Grammaticized Temporal Expressions Tense is grammaticalization of location in time (C</context>

Pooling documents over a given time window yielded a dynamic network of cities, enabling the researchers to track the evolution of the art world. The analysis revealed that a distinct central core of cities all in Europe and North America enjoyed a remarkably stable ranking as top art locales over the period; however, as the art world expanded, connection to these capitals became less important as an entry to the art world for locations outside the global north (Rule and Brandt, 2013). “The city that I believed was my past, is my future, my present; the years I have spent in Europe are an illusion, I always was (and will be) in Buenos Aires” (Borges, 1978). Borges’ remarks capture a paradox about places of significance: important places are places where important things have happened and will happen–but this is so from the viewpoint of the present, which is always evolving. This insight implies that in order to understand the dynamics shaping the geography of significant art activity, analysts need to disentangle the real time in which attributions of significance to locat</context>

News describe real-world events of vary-
ing granularity, and recognition of inter-
nal structure of events is important for au-
tomated reasoning over events. We pro-
pose an approach for constructing coherent
event hierarchies from news by enforcing
document-level coherence over pairwise
decisions of spatiotemporal containment.
Evaluation on a news corpus annotated
with event hierarchies shows that enforc-
ing global spatiotemporal coreference of
events leads to significant improvements
(7.6% F1-score) in the accuracy of pair-
wise decisions.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993885625">
Although real-world events have exact spatiotempo-
ral extent, event mentions in text are often spatially
and temporally vague. Moreover, event mentions
typically denote real-world events of varying gran-
ularity (e.g., summit vs. conversation). If not ad-
dressed, these issues hinder event-based inference.
Research efforts in event extraction have focused
on either extracting temporal relations (Pustejovsky
et al., 2003a; UzZaman et al., 2013) or recognizing
spatial relations (Mani et al., 2010; Roberts et al.,
2013) between events. Apart from being difficult
to recognize, temporal and spatial containment –
when considered in isolation – do not suffice to
infer that one event is a part of another. Temporally,
an event may happen during another event and not
be a part of it, as in (1).

(1) In the midst of the World War II, the Ar-
gentinian government reduced rents.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99257603030303">
In this case, “the reduction of rents in Argentina”
happened during “the World War II,” but was not
part of it. Conversely, an event may occur within
the spatial extent of another event and not be a part
of it, as shown by (2).
(2) The fire destroyed 60% of London after
almost 30,000 people died from plague.
The spatial extent of “destruction by fire” is con-
tained within the extent of “people dying from
plague,” but the former is not a part of the latter.
An event e1 is a part of event e2 if and only if e1 is
spatially and temporally contained within e2.
In previous research (Chambers and Jurafsky,
2008; Jans et al., 2012), news narratives were mod-
eled as chains of events involving the same par-
ticipants. Such script-like representations, how-
ever, do not account for the non-linear (hierarchi-
cal) nature of events. In contrast, in this work we
model the structure of events in a narrative via
relations of spatiotemporal containment (STC) be-
tween event mentions, effectively inducing a hierar-
chy of events. We construct directed acyclic graphs
of event mentions, in which edges denote STC re-
lations between events. We call this structure an
event hierarchy directed acyclic graph (EHDAG).
We propose a two-step approach for constructing
EHDAGs from news. We first detect the STC rela-
tions between pairs of event mentions in a super-
vised fashion, building on our previous approach
(Glavaˇs et al., 2014). We then enforce structural
coherence over local predictions, framing the task
as a constrained optimization problem, which we
solve using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).

Introduction of the TimeML standard (Pustejovsky
et al., 2003a) and the TimeBank corpus (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003b) triggered a surge of research
on extraction of temporal relations, much of which
within TempEval campaigns (Verhagen et al., 2010;
UzZaman et al., 2013). More recently, following
the emergence of the SpatialML standard (Mani et
al., 2010), Roberts et al. (2013) have proposed an
annotation scheme and the supervised model for
extracting spatial relations between events.
The abovementioned approaches, however, do

not account for global narrative coherence. Cham-
bers and Jurafsky (2008) consider narratives to be
chains of temporally ordered events linked by a
common protagonist. Limiting a narrative to a se-
quence of protagonist-sharing events can often be
overly restrictive. E.g., an “encounter between
Merkel and Holland” may belong to the same
“summit” narrative as a “meeting between Obama
and Putin,” although they share no protagonists.
Several approaches enforce coherence of tempo-
ral relations at a document level. Bramsen et al.
(2006) represent the temporal structure of a doc-
ument as a DAG in which vertices denote textual
segments and edges temporal precedence. Simi-
larly, Do et al. (2012) enforce coherence using ILP
for joint inference on decisions from local event–
event and event–time interval decisions.
Complementary to Chambers and Jurafsky
(2008), who use a linear temporal structure, with
EHDAGs we model the hierarchical structure of
events with diverse participants. Similarly to Bram-
sen et al. (2006), we use an ILP formulation of
global coherence over local decisions, but consider
STC relations between events rather than temporal
relations between textual segments.

3.1 Spatiotemporal Containment Classifier
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998715625">
We first describe the classifier used for predicting
local STC relations. The classifier is given a pair of
event mentions, (e1, e2), where mention e1 occurs
in text before mention e2. The classifier predicts
one of the following relations: (1) e1 SUBSUPER
e2, denoting that the e1 (subevent) is spatiotem-
porally contained by event e2 (superevent); (2)
e1 SUPERSUB e2, denoting that e1 (superevent)
spatiotemporally contains e2 (subevent); and (3)
NOREL, denoting that neither of the two events
spatiotemporally contains the other. We use the
following rich set of features for the STC relation
classifier.
Event-based features: Word, lemma, stem,
POS-tag, and TimeML type of both event mentions.
Additionally, we compare the event arguments
of three semantic types: AGENT, TARGET, and
LOCATION, which we extract automatically from
raw text using the rule-based model by Glavaˇs and
ˇSnajder (2013).
Bag-of-words features: All lemmas in between
the two event mentions, with the special status
being assigned to temporal signals (e.g., before)
and spatial signals (e.g., inside).
Positional features: The distance between event
mentions in the document, both in the number of
sentences and the number of tokens. Additionally,
we use a feature indicating if the two mentions are
adjacent (no mentions occur in between).
Syntactic features: All dependency relations
on the path between events in the dependency
tree and features that indicate whether one of
the features syntactically governs the other. We
compute the syntactic features only for pairs of
event mentions from the same sentence, using the
Stanford dependency parser (De Marneffe et al.,
2006).
Knowledge-based features: Computed using
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), VerbOcean (Chklovski
and Pantel, 2004), and CatVar (Habash and Dorr,
2003). We use a feature indicating whether one
event mention or any of its derivatives (obtained
from CatVar) is a WordNet hypernym of (for nomi-
nalized mentions) or entailed from (for verb men-
tions) the other mention (or any of its deriva-
tives). We use an additional feature to indicate the
VerbOcean relation between the event mentions, if
such exists. Unlike features from previous groups,

knowledge-based features have not been used often
for temporal relation classification.
We employ a L2-regularized logistic regres-
sion as our pairwise classification model, which
is motivated by the high-dimensional feature space
spanned by the lexical features Moreover, the
global coherence component of the model requires
probability distributions for local decisions over
relation types. We use the LibLinear (Fan et al.,
2008) implementation of logistic regression.

3.2 Global Coherence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998105">
The hierarchy of events induced from the indepen-
dent pairwise STC decisions may be globally in-
coherent. We therefore need to optimize the set of
pairwise STC classifications with respect to the set
of constraints that enforce global coherence. We
perform exact inference using Integer Linear Pro-
gramming (ILP), an approach that has been proven
useful in many NLP applications (Punyakanok et
al., 2004; Roth and Yih, 2007; Clarke and Lapata,
2008). We use the lp solve1 solver to optimize the
objective function with respect to the constraints.
Objective function. Let M = {e1, e2,... , en}
be the set of all event mentions in the news story
and P be the set of all considered pairs of event
mentions, P = {(ei, ej) I ei, ej E M, i &lt; j}.
Let R = {SUPERSUB, SUBSUPER, NOREL} be
the set of spatiotemporal relation types and let
C(ei, ej, r) be the probability, produced by the
pairwise classifier, of relation r holding between
event mentions ei and ej. We maximize the sum
of local probabilities assigned to all pairs of events
(summed over all relation types):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.997866">
� � C(ei, ej, r) &apos; xei,ej,r (1)
(ei,ej)EP rER
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999780111111111">
where xei,ej,r is a binary indicator variable that
takes the value 1 iff the relation of type r is pre-
dicted to hold between events ei and ej.
Spatiotemporal constraints. The objective
function is a subject to two basic constraints: (i)
the constraint that declares xei,ej,r to be binary
indicator variables (eq. 2) and (ii) the exclusivity
constraint, which allows only one relation to hold
between two events (eq. 3).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.871346">

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992945">
Following the work of Bramsen et al. (2006) and
Do et al. (2012), we also incorporate the transitiv-
ity constraints into the model (transitivity is not
enforced for NOREL):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99027">
xei,ej,r + xej,ek,r − 1 &lt; xei,ek,r, (4)
br E R, {(ei, ej), (ej, ek), (ei, ek)} C P
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853411764706">
The transitivity constraint states that, if the same
relation r holds for pairs of events (ei, ej) and
(ej, ek), then r must also hold for the pair (ei, ek).
Coreference constraints. The constraints pre-
sented so far did not consider the coreference of
event mentions. However, a truly coherent event
structure must account for the different mentions
of the same event. More precisely, two different
constraints have to be enforced: (i) a pair of coref-
erent event mentions can only be assigned relation
of the NOREL type because coreferent event men-
tions cannot be part of each other (eq. 5) and (ii)
all coreferent mentions of one event must be in
the same relation with all coreferent mentions of
the other event (eqs. 6–9). Let coref (ei, ej) be a
predicate that holds iff mentions e1 and e2 corefer.
The coreference constraints are as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9995998">
xei,ej,r = 1, (5)
b(ei, ej) E P, r = NOREL, coref (ei, ej)
xei,ek,r − xej,ek,r = 0, (6)
b(ei, ek), (ej, ek) E P, r E R, coref (ei, ej)
xei,ek,r − xek,ej,r−1 = 0, (7)
b(ei, ek), (ek, ej) E P, r E R, coref (ei, ej)
xek,ei,r − xej,ek,r−1 = 0, (8)
b(ek, ei), (ej, ek) E P, r E R, coref (ei, ej)
xek,ei,r − xek,ej,r = 0, (9)
b(ek, ei), (ek, ej) E P, r E R, coref (ei, ej)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999815">
In equations (7) and (8), the relation type r−1 de-
notes the inverse of the relation type r. The in-
verse of SUPERSUB is SUBSUPER (and vice versa),
whereas NOREL is an inverse to itself.

4.1 Experimental Setup
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99948803030303">
We leave out 20 news stories from the HIEVE cor-
pus for testing and use the remaining 80 documents
for training the pairwise STC classifiers. Alto-
gether, we evaluate the following five models.
PAIRWISE model employs only the pairwise clas-
sification and does not enforce coherence across
local decisions. We evaluate two classifiers: one
with knowledge-based features (PAIRWISE-FULL)
and one without (PAIRWISE-NOKB).
COHERENT model enforces document-level spa-
tiotemporal coherence by solving the constrained
optimization problem on top of pairwise classifica-
tion decisions. The model uses the constraints from
(2)–(4), but not the coreference-based constraints.
COREF-GOLD model uses coreference con-
straints (6)–(9) in addition to constraints (2)–(4).
The model uses hand-annotated coreference rela-
tions from the HIEVE corpus.
COREF-AUTO model uses the same set of con-
straints as the previous model, but relies on the
event coreference resolution model by Glavaˇs and
ˇSnajder (2013) instead on gold annotations.
As the baseline, we use the MEMORIZE model,
which simply assigns to each pair of event men-
tions in the test set their most frequent label in the
training set. The NOREL label is predicted for the
pairs of lemmas not observed in the training set.
A similar baseline has been proposed by Bethard
(2008) for automated extraction of event mentions.
To account for the transitivity of the STC re-
lation, we evaluate the predictions of our models
against the transitive closure of gold STC hierar-
chies from the HIEVE corpus.

4.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975111111111">
Table 1 summarizes the results. We show the
performance (precision, recall, and Fl-score) for
the SUPERSUB and SUBSUPER relations along
with the micro-averaged performance. All mod-
els significantly outperform the MEMORIZE base-
line (with the exception of PAIRWISE-NOKB’s
precision), which has been shown competitive on
the event extraction task (Bethard, 2008). Over-
all, the PAIRWISE-FULL model outperforms the
PAIRWISE-NOKB model, confirming the intuition
that knowledge-based information is useful for de-
tecting relations between events. However, includ-
ing KB features decreases the performance on the
SUBSUPER class, which requires further analysis.
Comparison of the PAIRWISE models and the
COHERENT model reveals that enforcing global
coherence of local relations substantially improves
the quality of the constructed hierarchies (4.9% Fi-
score; significant at p&lt;0.01 using stratified shuf-
fling (Yeh, 2000)). With the introduction of addi-
tional reference constraints (model COREF-GOLD),
the quality improves by additional 2.7% Fl-score
(significant at p&lt;0.05). The fact that the model
COREF-AUTO is outperformed by the COHERENT
model, however, suggests that the automated coref-
erence resolution model is not accurate enough to
benefit the global coherence constraints.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955533333333">
We addressed the task of constructing coherent
event hierarchies based on recognition of spatiotem-
poral containment between events from their men-
tions in text. The proposed approach constructs
event hierarchies by enforcing document-level co-
herence over a set of local decisions on spatiotem-
poral containment between events. The quality
of the extracted event hierarchies is improved by
enforcing global coherence, and can be improved
even further using event coreference-based con-
straints, provided accurate coreference resolution is
available. Our next step will be to incorporate pre-
dictions from state-of-the-art temporal and spatial
relation extraction models, both as STC classifier
features and as additional optimization constraints.

<abstract confidence="0.998074933333333">News describe real-world events of varying granularity, and recognition of internal structure of events is important for automated reasoning over events. We propose an approach for constructing coherent event hierarchies from news by enforcing document-level coherence over pairwise decisions of spatiotemporal containment. Evaluation on a news corpus annotated with event hierarchies shows that enforcing global spatiotemporal coreference of events leads to significant improvements in the accuracy of pairwise decisions.</abstract>

The model uses hand-annotated coreference relations from the HIEVE corpus. COREF-AUTO model uses the same set of constraints as the previous model, but relies on the event coreference resolution model by Glavaˇs and ˇSnajder (2013) instead on gold annotations. As the baseline, we use the MEMORIZE model, which simply assigns to each pair of event mentions in the test set their most frequent label in the training set. The NOREL label is predicted for the pairs of lemmas not observed in the training set. A similar baseline has been proposed by Bethard (2008) for automated extraction of event mentions. To account for the transitivity of the STC relation, we evaluate the predictions of our models against the transitive closure of gold STC hierarchies from the HIEVE corpus. 4.2 Results Table 1 summarizes the results. We show the performance (precision, recall, and Fl-score) for the SUPERSUB and SUBSUPER relations along with the micro-averaged performance. All models significantly outperform the MEMORIZE baseline (with the exception of PAIRWISE-NOKB’s precision), which has been shown competitive on the event extraction task (Bethard, 2008).

Conversely, an event may occur within the spatial extent of another event and not be a part of it, as shown by (2). (2) The fire destroyed 60% of London after almost 30,000 people died from plague. The spatial extent of “destruction by fire” is contained within the extent of “people dying from plague,” but the former is not a part of the latter. An event e1 is a part of event e2 if and only if e1 is spatially and temporally contained within e2. In previous research (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Jans et al., 2012), news narratives were modeled as chains of events involving the same participants. Such script-like representations, however, do not account for the non-linear (hierarchical) nature of events. In contrast, in this work we model the structure of events in a narrative via relations of spatiotemporal containment (STC) between event mentions, effectively inducing a hierarchy of events.

Moreover, event mentions typically denote real-world events of varying granularity (e.g., summit vs. conversation). If not addressed, these issues hinder event-based inference. Research efforts in event extraction have focused on either extracting temporal relations (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a; UzZaman et al., 2013) or recognizing spatial relations (Mani et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2013) between events. Apart from being difficult to recognize, temporal and spatial containment – when considered in isolation – do not suffice to infer that one event is a part of another. Temporally, an event may happen during another event and not be a part of it, as in (1). (1) In the midst of the World War II, the Argentinian government reduced rents. In this case, “the reduction of rents in Argentina” happened during “the World War II,” but was not part of it.

We use the LibLinear (Fan et al., 2008) implementation of logistic regression. 3.2 Global Coherence The hierarchy of events induced from the independent pairwise STC decisions may be globally incoherent. We therefore need to optimize the set of pairwise STC classifications with respect to the set of constraints that enforce global coherence. We perform exact inference using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), an approach that has been proven useful in many NLP applications (Punyakanok et al., 2004; Roth and Yih, 2007; Clarke and Lapata, 2008).

Overall, the PAIRWISE-FULL model outperforms the PAIRWISE-NOKB model, confirming the intuition that knowledge-based information is useful for detecting relations between events. However, including KB features decreases the performance on the SUBSUPER class, which requires further analysis. Comparison of the PAIRWISE models and the COHERENT model reveals that enforcing global coherence of local relations substantially improves the quality of the constructed hierarchies (4.9% Fiscore; significant at p&lt;0.01 using stratified shuffling (Yeh, 2000)). With the introduction of additional reference constraints (model COREF-GOLD), the quality improves by additional 2.7% Fl-score (significant at p&lt;0.05). The fact that the model COREF-AUTO is outperformed by the COHERENT model, however, suggests that the automated coreference resolution model is not accurate enough to benefit the global coherence constraints. 5 Conclusion We addressed the task of constructing coherent event hierarchies based on recognition of spatiotemporal containment between events from their mentions in text.

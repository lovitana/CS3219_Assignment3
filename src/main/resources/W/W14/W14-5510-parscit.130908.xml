Retraction to: Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural
Language Processing, pages 74–79
The Coling 2014 Publication Chairs,1 in consultations and agreement with the organisers of the
Fifth Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing and not challenged by
the authors, who have been notified on the 6th of September 2014, hereby retract the workshop paper
entitled “Constituent structure representation of Pashto Endoclitics”, which appeared in Proceedings
of the Fifth Workshop on South and Southeast Asian Natural Language Processing (2014), pages
74–79, as Din et al. (2014) have copied substantial parts from a prior workshop paper published in
Proceedings of LFG10 and from a PhD thesis from 2007 without citing the source (Rizvi, 2007; B¨ogel,
2010). Furthermore, substantial parts of the introduction have been copied from a prior workshop
paper published in Proceedings of CAASL3: Third Workshop on Computational Approaches to Arabic-
Script-based Languages without marking the parts taken from the earlier paper as quotations (Kopris,
2009).
We thank Tina B¨ogel for bringing this serious violation of publication ethics to our attention.
On behalf of the Coling 2014 Publication Chairs,

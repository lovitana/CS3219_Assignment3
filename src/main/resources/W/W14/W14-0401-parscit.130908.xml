Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99990568">
The conventional tools of the “web as cor-
pus” framework rely heavily on URLs ob-
tained from search engines. Recently, the
corresponding querying process became
much slower or impossible to perform on a
low budget. I try to find acceptable substi-
tutes, i.e. viable link sources for web cor-
pus construction. To this end, I perform
a study of possible alternatives, includ-
ing social networks as well as the Open
Directory Project and Wikipedia. Four
different languages (Dutch, French, In-
donesian and Swedish) taken as exam-
ples show that complementary approaches
are needed. My scouting approach using
open-source software leads to a URL di-
rectory enriched with metadata which may
be used to start a web crawl. This is
more than a drop-in replacement for exist-
ing tools since said metadata enables re-
searchers to filter and select URLs that fit
particular needs, as they are classified ac-
cording to their language, their length and
a few other indicators such as host- and
markup-based data.

1.1 The “web as corpus” paradigm and its
URL seeds problem
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996138422222222">
The state of the art tools of the “web as corpus”
framework rely heavily on URLs obtained from
search engines. The BootCaT method (Baroni and
Bernardini, 2004) consists in repeated search en-
gine queries using several word seeds that are ran-
domly combined, first coming from an initial list
and later from unigram extraction over the cor-
pus itself. As a result, so-called “seed URLs”
are gathered which are used as a starting point for
web crawlers. This approach is not limited to En-
glish: it has been successfully used by Baroni et al.
(2009) and Kilgarriff et al. (2010) for major world
languages.
Until recently, the BootCaT method could be
used in free web corpus building approaches. To
my best knowledge it is now pass´e because of in-
creasing limitations on the search engines’ APIs,
which make the querying process on a low budget
much slower or impossible. Other technical diffi-
culties include diverse and partly unknown search
biases due in part to search engine optimization
tricks as well as undocumented PageRank adjust-
ments. All in all, the APIs may be too expensive
and/or too unstable to support large-scale corpus
building projects.
API changes are combined with an evolv-
ing web document structure and a slow but in-
escapable shift from “web as corpus” to “web
for corpus” due to the increasing number of web
pages and the necessity of using sampling meth-
ods at some stage. This is what I call the post-
BootCaT world in web corpus construction.1
Moreover, the question whether the method
used so far, i.e. randomizing keywords, provides
a good overview of a language is still open. It now
seems reasonable to look for alternatives, so that
research material does not depend on a single data
source, as this kind of black box effect combined
with paid queries really impedes reproducibility
of research. Using diverse sources of URL seeds
could at least ensure that there is not a single bias,
but several.
Additionally, the lack of interest and project fi-
nancing when dealing with certain less-resourced
languages makes it necessary to use light-weight

approaches where costs are lowered as much as
possible (Scannell, 2007). In this perspective, a
preliminary light scouting approach and a full-
fledged focused crawler like those used by the
Spiderling (Suchomel and Pomik´alek, 2012) or
the COW (Sch¨afer and Bildhauer, 2012) projects
are complementary. A “web for corpus” crawling
method using a seed set enriched with metadata as
described in this article may yield better results,
e.g. ensure a more diverse and less skewed sam-
ple distribution in a population of web documents,
and/or reach faster a given quantitative goal.

1.2 Looking for alternatives, what issues do
we face?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999732314285714">
Search engines have not been taken as a source
simply because they were convenient. They actu-
ally yield good results in terms of linguistic qual-
ity. The main advantage was to outsource oper-
ations such as web crawling and website quality
filtering, which are considered to be too costly or
too complicated to deal with while the main pur-
pose is actually to build a corpus.
In fact, it is not possible to start a web crawl
from scratch, so the main issue to tackle can be
put this way: where may we find web pages which
are bound to be interesting for corpus linguists and
which in turn contain many links to other interest-
ing web pages?
Researchers in the machine translation field
have started another attempt to outsource compe-
tence and computing power, making use of data
gathered by the CommonCrawl project2 to find
parallel corpora (Smith et al., 2013). Nonetheless,
the quality of the links may not live up to their
expectations. First, purely URL-based approaches
are a trade-off in favor of speed which sacrifices
precision, and language identification tasks are
a good example of this phenomenon (Baykan et
al., 2008). Second, machine-translated content is
a major issue, so is text quality in general, es-
pecially when it comes to web texts (Arase and
Zhou, 2013). Third, mixed-language documents
slow down text gathering processes (King and Ab-
ney, 2013). Fourth, link diversity is a also prob-
lem, which in my opinion has not got the atten-
tion it deserves. Last, the resource is constantly
moving. There are not only fast URL changes
and ubiquitous redirections. Following the “web
2.0” paradigm, much web content is being injected

from other sources, so that many web pages are
now expected to change any time.3 Regular ex-
ploration and re-analysis could be the way to go to
ensure the durability of the resource.
In the remainder of this paper, I introduce a
scouting approach which considers the first issue,
touches on the second one, provides tools and met-
rics to address the third and fourth, and adapts to
the last. In the following section I describe my
methodology, then I show in detail which metrics
I decided to use, and last I discuss the results.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99982">
2.1 Languages studied
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999813">
I chose four different languages in order to see if
my approach generalizes well: Dutch, French, In-
donesian and Swedish. It enables me to compare
several language-dependent web spaces which
ought to have different if not incompatible char-
acteristics. In fact, the “speaker to website quan-
tity” ratio is probably extremely different when it
comes to Swedish and Indonesian. I showed in a
previous study that this affects greatly link discov-
ery and corpus construction processes (Barbaresi,
2013a).
French is spoken on several continents and
Dutch is spoken in several countries (Afrikaans
was not part of this study). Indonesian offers an
interesting point of comparison, as the chances to
find web pages in this language during a crawl at
random are scarce. For this very reason, I explic-
itly chose not to study English or Chinese because
they are clearly the most prominently represented
languages on the web.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999548">
2.2 Data sources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934416666667">
I use two reference points, the first one being
the existing method depending on search engine
queries, upon which I hope to cast a new light
with this study. The comparison grounds on URLs
retrieved using the BootCaT seed method on the
meta-engine E-Tools4 at the end of 2012. The sec-
ond reference point consists of social networks,
to whose linguistic structure I already dedicated
a study (Barbaresi, 2013b) where the method used
to find the URLs is described in detail. I chose
to adopt a different perspective, to re-examine the
URLs I gathered and to add relevant metadata

in order to see how they compared to the other
sources studied here.
I chose to focus on three different networks:
FriendFeed, an aggregator that offers a broader
spectrum of retrieved information; identi.ca, a mi-
croblogging service similar to Twitter; and Red-
dit, a social bookmarking and microblogging plat-
form. Perhaps not surprisingly, these data sources
display the issues linked to API instability men-
tioned above. The example of identi.ca is telling:
until March 2013, when the API was closed af-
ter the company was bought, it was a social mi-
croblogging service built on open source tools and
open standards, the advantages compared to Twit-
ter include the Creative Commons license of the
content, and the absence of limitations on the total
number of pages seen.
Another data source is the Open Directory
Project (DMOZ5), where a selection of links is cu-
rated according to their language and/or topic. The
language classification is expected to be adequate,
but the amount of viable links is an open question,
as well as the content.
Last, the free encyclopedia Wikipedia is another
spam-resilient data source in which the quality of
links is expected to be high. It is acknowledged
that the encyclopedia in a given language edition
is a useful resource, the open question resides in
the links pointing to the outside world, as it is hard
to get an idea of their characteristics due to the
large number of articles, which is rapidly increas-
ing even for an under-resourced language such as
Indonesian.

to enable construction of a text corpus. The
URL checker removes non-http protocols, images,
PDFs, audio and video files, ad banners, feeds and
unwanted hostnames like twitter.com, google.com,
youtube.com or flickr.com. Additionally, a proper
spam filtering is performed on the whole URL (us-
ing basic regular expressions) as well as at do-
main name level using a list of blacklisted domains
comparable to those used by e-mail services to fil-
ter spam. As a page is downloaded or a query is
executed, links are filtered on-the-fly using a se-
ries of heuristics described below, and finally the
rest of the links are stored.
There are two other major filtering operations to
be aware of. The first concerns the URLs, which
are sampled prior to the download. The main goal
of this operation is strongly related to my scout-
ing approach. Since I set my tools on an explo-
ration course, this allows for a faster execution
and provides us with a more realistic image of
what awaits a potential exhaustive crawler. Be-
cause of the sampling approach, the “big picture”
cannot easily be distorted by a single website. This
also avoids “hammering” a particular server un-
duly and facilitates compliance with robots.txt as
well as other ethical rules. The second filter deals
with the downloaded content: web pages are dis-
carded if they are too short. Web documents which
are more than a few megabytes long are also dis-
carded.
Regarding the web pages, the software fetches
them from a list, strips the HTML code, sends raw
text to a server instance of langid.py (description
below) and retrieves the server response, on which
it performs a basic heuristic tests.

3 Metadata
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971545454546">
The metadata described in this section can be used
in classificatory or graph-based approaches. I use
some of them in the results below but did not ex-
haust all the possible combinations in this study.
There are nine of them in total, which can be
divided in three categories: corpus size metrics,
which are related to word count measures, web
science metrics, which ought to be given a higher
importance in web corpus building, and finally the
language identification, which is performed using
an external tool.

3.1 Corpus size metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999234833333333">
Web page length (in characters) was used as a dis-
criminating factor. Web pages which were too
short (less than 1,000 characters long after HTML
stripping) were discarded in order to avoid docu-
ments containing just multimedia (pictures and/or
videos) or microtext collections for example, as
the purpose was to simulate the creation of a
general-purpose text corpus.
The page length in characters after stripping
was recorded, as well as the number of tokens,
so that the total number of tokens of a web cor-
pus built on this URL basis can be estimated. The
page length distribution is not normal, with a ma-
jority of short web texts and a few incredibly long
documents at the end of the spectrum, which is
emphasized by the differences between mean and
median values used in the results below and justi-
fies the mention of both.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997966">
3.2 Web science metrics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988424242424">
Host sampling is a very important step because
the number of web pages is drastically reduced,
which makes the whole process more feasible and
more well-balanced, i.e. less prone to host biases.
IP-based statistics corroborate this hypothesis, as
shown below.
The deduplication operation is elementary, it
takes place at document level, using a hash func-
tion. The IP diversity is partly a relevant indicator,
as it can be used to prove that not all domain names
lead to the same server. Nonetheless, it cannot de-
tect the duplication of the same document across
many different servers with different IPs, which in
turn the elementary deduplication is able to reveal.
Links that lead to pages within the same domain
name and links which lead to other domains are
extracted from the HTML markup. The first num-
ber can be used to find possible spam or irrelevant
links, with the notable exception of websites like
Amazon or Wikipedia, which are quite easy to list.
The latter may be used to assess the richness (or at
a given level the suspiciousness) of a website by
the company it keeps. While this indicator is not
perfect, it enables users to draw conclusions with-
out fetching all the downstream URLs.
Moreover, even if I do not take advantage of this
information in this study, the fetcher also records
all the links it “sees” (as an origin-destination
pair), which enables graph-based approaches such
as visualization of the gathered network or the as-
sessment of the “weight” of a website in the URL
directory. Also, these metadata may very well be
useful for finding promising start URLs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996382">
3.3 Language identification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963913043478">
I consider the fact that a lot of web pages have
characteristics which make it hard for “classical”
NLP approaches like web page language identifi-
cation based on URLs (Baykan et al., 2008) to pre-
dict the languages of the links with certainty. That
is why mature NLP tools have to be used to qualify
the incoming URLs and enable a language-based
filtering based on actual facts.
The language identification tool I used is
langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012). It is open-
source, it incorporates a pre-trained model and it
covers 97 languages, which is ideal for tackling
the diversity of the web. Its use as a web ser-
vice makes it a fast solution enabling distant or
distributed work.
As the software is still under active develop-
ment, it can encounter difficulties with rare encod-
ings. As a result, the text gets falsely classified as
for example Russian or Chinese. The languages I
studied are not affected by these issues. Still, lan-
guage identification at document level raises a few
problems regarding “parasite” languages (Scan-
nell, 2007).
Using a language identification system has a
few benefits: it enables finding “regular” texts in
terms of statistical properties and excluding cer-
tain types of irregularities such as encoding prob-
lems. Web text collections are smoothed out in
relation to the statistical model applied for each
language target, which is a partly destructive but
interesting feature.
There are cases where the confidence interval
of the language identifier is highly relevant, for in-
stance if the page is multi-lingual. Then there are
two main effects: on one hand the confidence in-
dicator gets a lower value, so that it is possible to
isolate pages which are likely to be in the target
language only. On the other hand, the language
guessed is the one with the largest number of iden-
tifiable words: if a given web page contains 70 %
Danish and 30 % English, then it will be classified
as being written in Danish, with a low confidence
interval: this information is part of the metadata I
associate with each web page. Since nothing par-
ticular stood out in this respect I do not mention it
further.

4.1 Characteristics of the BootCaT approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983529411765">
First of all, I let my toolchain run on URLs ob-
tained using the BootCaT approach, in order to
get a glimpse of its characteristics. I let the
URL extractor run for several weeks on Indone-
sian and Swedish and only a few days for Dutch
and French, since I was limited by the constraints
of this approach, which becomes exponentially
slower as one adds target languages.6 The results
commented below are displayed in table 1.
The domain name reduction has a substantial
impact on the set of URLs, as about a quarter of
the URLs at best (for French) have different do-
main names. This is a first hint at the lack of
diversity of the URLs found using the BootCaT
technique.
Unsurprisingly, the majority of links appear to
be in the target language, although the language
filters do not seem to perform very well. As the
adequate matching of documents to the user’s lan-
guage is paramount for search engines, it is prob-
ably a bias of the querying methodology and its
random tuples of tokens. In fact, it is not rare to
find unexpected and undesirable documents such
as word lists or search engine optimization traps.
The length of web documents is remarkable, it
indicates that there are likely to contain long texts.
Moreover, the median length seems to be quite
constant across the three languages at about 8,000
tokens, whereas it is less than half that (3,600) for
Dutch. All in all, it appears to be an advantage
which clearly explains why this method has been
considered to be successful. The potential cor-
pus sizes are noteworthy, especially when enough
URLs where gathered in the first place, which was

already too impracticable in my case to be consid-
ered a sustainable option.
The number of different IPs, i.e. the diversity
in terms of hosts, seems to get gradually lower
as the URL list becomes larger. The fact that
the same phenomenon happens for Indonesian and
Swedish, with one host out of five being “new”,
indicates a strong tendency.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.973419">
4.2 Social networks
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999910148148148">
Due to the mixed nature of the experimental set-
ting, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the
single components. The more than 700,000 URLs
that were analyzed give an insight regarding the
usefulness of these sources. About a tenth of it re-
mained as responding websites with different do-
main names, which is the lowest ratio of this study.
It may be explained by the fast-paced evolution of
microblogs and also by the potential impurity of
the source compared to the user-reviewed directo-
ries whose results I describe next.
As I did not target the studied languages during
the URL collection process, there were merely a
few hundred different domain names to be found,
with the exception of French, which was a lot more
prominent.
Table 2 provides an overview of the results. The
mean and median lengths are clearly lower than
in the search engine experiment. In the case of
French, with a comparable number of remaining
URLs, the corpus size estimate is about 2.5 times
smaller. The host diversity is comparable, and
does not seem to be an issue at this point.
All in all, social networks are probably a good
candidate for web corpora, but they require a fo-
cused approach of microtext to target a particular
community of speakers.

ing the best ratio in this study between unfiltered
and remaining URLs. The lack of web pages writ-
ten in Indonesian is a problem for this source,
whereas the other languages seem to be far bet-
ter covered. The adequacy of the web pages with
respect to their language is excellent, as shown in
table 3. These results underline the quality of the
resource.
On the other hand, document length is the
biggest issue here. The mean and median val-
ues indicate that this characteristic is quite ho-
mogeneous throughout the document collection.
This may easily be explained by the fact that the
URLs which are listed on DMOZ mostly lead
to corporate homepages for example, which are
clear and concise, the eventual “real” text content
being somewhere else. What’s more, the web-
sites in question are not text reservoirs by nature.
Nonetheless, the sheer quantity of listed URLs
compensates for this fact. The corpus sizes for
Dutch and French are quite reasonable if one bears
in mind that the URLs were sampled.
The relative diversity of IPs compared to the
number of domain names visited is another indica-
tor that the Open Directory leads to a wide range of
websites. The directory performs well compared
to the sources mentioned above, it is also much
easier to crawl. It did not cost us more than a few
lines of code followed by a few minutes of runtime
to gather the URLs.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990475">
4.4 Wikipedia
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997684375">
The characteristics of Wikipedia are quite simi-
lar, since the free encyclopedia also makes dumps
available, which are easily combed through in or-
der to gather start URLs. Wikipedia also com-
pares favorably to search engines or social net-
works when it comes to the sampling operation
and page availability. It is a major source of URLs,
with numbers of gathered URLs in the millions for
languages like French. As Wikipedia is not a URL
directory by nature, it is interesting to see what are
the characteristics of the pages it links to are. The
results are shown in table 3.
First, the pages referenced in a particular lan-
guage edition of Wikipedia often point to web
pages written in a foreign language. According to
my figures, this is a clear case, all the more since
web pages in Indonesian are rare. Still, with a to-
tal of more than 4,000 retained web texts, it fares
a lot better than DMOZ or social networks.
The web pages are longer than the ones from
DMOZ, but shorter than the rest. This may also be
related to the large number of concise homepages
in the total. Nonetheless, the impressive num-
ber of URLs in the target language is decisive for
corpus building purposes, with the second-biggest
corpus size estimate obtained for French.
The IP-related indicator yields good results with
respect to the number of URLs that were retrieved.
Because to the high number of analyzed URLs the
figures between 30 and 46% give an insight into
the concentration of web hosting providers on the

I also analyzed the results regarding the num-
ber of links that lead out of the page’s domain
name. For all sources, I found no consistent re-
sults across languages, with figures varying by a
factor of three. Nonetheless, there seem to be a
tendency towards a hierarchy in which the search
engines are on top, followed by social networks,
Wikipedia and DMOZ. This is one more hint at
the heterogeneous nature of the data sources I ex-
amined with respect to the criteria I chose.
This hierarchy is also one more reason why

search engines queries are believed to be fast and
reliable in terms of quantity. This method was
fast, as the web pages are long and full of links,
which enables to rapidly harvest a large number
of web pages without having to worry about going
round in circles. The researchers using the Boot-
CaT method probably took advantage of the undo-
cumented but efficient filtering operations which
search engines perform in order to lead to reli-
able documents. Since this process takes place in
a competitive sector where this kind of informa-
tion can be sold, it may explain why the companies
now try to avoid giving it away for free.
In the long run, several questions regarding
URL quality remain open. As I show using a high-
credibility source such as Wikipedia, the search
engines results are probably closer to the maxi-
mum amount of text that is to be found on a given
website than the other sources, all the more when
the sampling procedure chooses a page at random
without analyzing the rest of a website and thus
without maximizing its potential in terms of to-
kens. Nonetheless, confrontation with the con-
stantly increasing number of URLs to analyze and
necessarily limited resources make a website sam-
pling by domain name useful.
This is part of my cost-efficient approach, where
the relatively low performance of Wikipedia and
DMOZ is compensated by the ease of URL ex-
traction. Besides, the size of the potential corpora
mentioned here could increase dramatically if one
was to remove the domain name sampling process
and if one was to select the web pages with the
most out-domain links for the crawl.
What’s more, DMOZ and Wikipedia are likely
to improve over time concerning the number of
URLs they reference. As diversity and costs (tem-
poral or financial) are real issues, a combined ap-
proach could take the best of all worlds and pro-
vide a web crawler with distinct and distant start-
ing points, between the terse web pages referenced
in DMOZ and the expected “freshness” of social
networks. This could be a track to consider, as
they could provide a not inconsiderable amount of
promising URLs.
Finally, from the output of the toolchain to
a full-fledged web corpus, other fine-grained in-
struments as well as further decisions processes
(Sch¨afer et al., 2013) will be needed. The fact that
web documents coming from several sources al-
ready differ by our criteria does not exclude fur-
ther differences regarding text content. By way
of consequence, future work could include a few
more linguistically relevant text quality indicators
in order to go further in bridging the gap between
web data, NLP and corpus linguistics.

6 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.99952575">
I evaluated several strategies for finding texts on
the web. The results distinguish no clear win-
ner, complementary approaches are called for. In
light of these results, it seems possible to replace
or at least to complement the existing BootCaT
approach. It is understandable why search en-
gine queries have been considered a useful data
source. However, I revealed that they lack diver-

sity at some point, which apart from their imprac-
ticality may provide sufficient impetus to look for
alternatives.
I discussed how I address several issues in or-
der to design robust processing tools which (com-
bined to the diversity of sources and usable meta-
data) enable researchers to get a better glimpse of
the course a crawl may take. The problem of link
diversity has not been well-studied in a corpus lin-
guistics context; I presented metrics to help quan-
tify it and I showed a possible way to go in order
to gather a corpus using several sources leading to
a satisfying proportion of different domain names
and hosts.
As a plea for a technicalities-aware corpus cre-
ation, I wish to bring to linguists’ attention that the
first step of web corpus construction in itself can
change a lot of parameters. I argue that a minimum
of web science knowledge among the corpus lin-
guistics community could be very useful to fully
comprehend all the issues at stake when dealing
with corpora from the web.
The toolchain used to perform these experi-
ments is open-source and can be found online.7
The resulting URL directory, which includes the
metadata used in this article, is available upon re-
quest. The light scouting approach allows for reg-
ular updates of the URL directory. It could also
take advantage of the strengths of other tools in
order to suit the needs of different communities.

<abstract confidence="0.997181730769231">The conventional tools of the “web as corpus” framework rely heavily on URLs obtained from search engines. Recently, the corresponding querying process became much slower or impossible to perform on a low budget. I try to find acceptable substitutes, i.e. viable link sources for web corpus construction. To this end, I perform a study of possible alternatives, including social networks as well as the Open Directory Project and Wikipedia. Four different languages (Dutch, French, Indonesian and Swedish) taken as examples show that complementary approaches are needed. My scouting approach using open-source software leads to a URL directory enriched with metadata which may be used to start a web crawl. This is more than a drop-in replacement for existing tools since said metadata enables researchers to filter and select URLs that fit particular needs, as they are classified according to their language, their length and a few other indicators such as hostand markup-based data.</abstract>

It is opensource, it incorporates a pre-trained model and it covers 97 languages, which is ideal for tackling the diversity of the web. Its use as a web service makes it a fast solution enabling distant or distributed work. As the software is still under active development, it can encounter difficulties with rare encodings. As a result, the text gets falsely classified as for example Russian or Chinese. The languages I studied are not affected by these issues. Still, language identification at document level raises a few problems regarding “parasite” languages (Scannell, 2007). Using a langu</context>

In this perspective, a preliminary light scouting approach and a fullfledged focused crawler like those used by the Spiderling (Suchomel and Pomik´alek, 2012) or the COW (Sch¨afer and Bildhauer, 2012) projects are complementary. A “web for corpus” crawling method using a seed set enriched with metadata as described in this article may yield better results, e.g. ensure a more diverse and less skewed sample distribution in a population of web documents, and/or reach faster a given quantitative goal. 1.2 Looking for alternatives, what issues do we face?

Still, language identification at document level raises a few problems regarding “parasite” languages (Scannell, 2007). Using a language identification system has a few benefits: it enables finding “regular” texts in terms of statistical properties and excluding certain types of irregularities such as encoding problems. Web text collections are smoothed out in relation to the statistical model applied for each language target, which is a partly destructive but interesting feature. There are cases where the confidence interval of the language identifier is highly relevant, for instance if the page is multi-lingual. Then there are two main effects: on one hand the confidence indicator gets a lower value, so tha</context>

In fact, it is not possible to start a web crawl from scratch, so the main issue to tackle can be put this way: where may we find web pages which are bound to be interesting for corpus linguists and which in turn contain many links to other interesting web pages? Researchers in the machine translation field have started another attempt to outsource competence and computing power, making use of data gathered by the CommonCrawl project2 to find parallel corpora (Smith et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the quality of the links may not live up to their expectations. First, purely URL-based approaches are a trade-off in favor of speed which sacrifices precision, and language identification tasks are a good example of this phenomenon (Baykan et al., 2008). Second, machine-translated content is a major issue, so is text quality in general, especially when it comes to web texts (Arase and Zhou, 2013). Third, mixed-language documents slow down text gathering processes (King and Abney, 2013). Fourth, link diversity is a also problem, which in my opinion has not got the attention it d</context>

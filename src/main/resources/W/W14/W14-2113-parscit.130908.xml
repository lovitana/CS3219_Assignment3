Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999741875">
In the experimental sciences authors use
the scientific article to express their find-
ings by making an argumentative claim.
While past studies have located the claim
in the Abstract, the Introduction, and in
the Discussion section, in this paper we fo-
cus on the article title as a potential source
of the claim. Our investigation has sug-
gested that titles which contain a tensed
verb almost certainly announce the argu-
ment claim while titles which do not con-
tain a tensed verb have varied announce-
ments. Another observation that we have
confirmed in our dataset is that the fre-
quency of verbs in titles of experimental
research articles has increased over time.

<bodyText confidence="0.998933857142857">
In this paper we are interested in determining
what is being claimed in articles in experimen-
tal (not clinical) biomedical literature, in partic-
ular. Claims have been studied in the argumen-
tation literature from many different standpoints
(White, 2009). Rhetorical structure theory was
developed from systemic functional linguistics to
map connections among texts (Mann and Thomp-
son, 1987); Argumentative zoning was developed
from Swales’ CARS model of moves made in re-
search articles (Teufel, 1999; Teufel and Moens,
1999; Teufel and Moens, 2002). Toulmin-based
analysis has also been used to map the argumen-
tative structure of articles (Toulmin, 1958 2003;
Jenicek, 2006; Reed and Rowe, 2006; Graves et
al., 2013; Graves, 2013). With these models of
argument in mind, we view the claim of a scien-
tific argument as the conclusion that the authors
infer from known information and new informa-
tion (results from an experiment or other forms of
observations). Past studies locate the claim in the

Abstract (Kanoksilapatham, 2013), at the end of
the Introduction (Swales, 1990; Swales and Najjar,
1987; Kanoksilapatham, 2005; Kanoksilapatham,
2012), and in the Discussion section (Kanoksilap-
atham, 2005). Our observations of changes in the
genre of the research article have led us to per-
form a preliminary investigation of titles with the
outcome being a provisional typology.

<bodyText confidence="0.999735866666667">
The Genia Tagger uses the Penn Treebank Tagset.
In the following we mention the verb tags from
this tagset: VB – base form, VBD – past tense,
VBG – gerund, VBN – past participle, VBP
– present tense non-3rd person singular, VBZ
– present tense 3rd person singular. We ap-
plied these tags to the dataset of biomedical ar-
ticle titles and abstracts used in this preliminary
study has been taken from MEDLINE, the well-
known biomedical bibliographic repository that
contains over 19 million citations and abstracts for
about 81% of these citations from approximately
5600 journals (NLM, 2013 accessed 3 February
2014). We have curated a small database using
biotextEngine and some locally developed tools.

We believe that our methods for identifying titles
could lead to better literature search techniques.
If researchers are able to identify the claim of
an article from a search of titles alone, they will
be able to evaluate the relevance of each article
more efficiently. We suspect that the increase in
titles with verbs and claims in them is an emerg-
ing trend, possibly the result of explicit editorial
policy. One side effect of including claims in ti-
tles may be higher quality writing by the authors.
Another result from using verbs in titles could be
the automation of claim extraction. Finally, hav-
ing research scientists use clear language to state
their claim can have the added benefit of making
knowledge translation more effective by lessening
the difficulty of reading scientific texts. This, in
turn, might afford greater access to the research
outcomes by clinical practitioners (one of the main
readerships of biomedical research).

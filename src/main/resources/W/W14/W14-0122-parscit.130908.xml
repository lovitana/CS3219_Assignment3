We present a reinterpretation of lexi-
cal information embedded in the English
WordNet in an alternate type of structure
called lexical system. First, we charac-
terize lexical systems as graphs of lexical
units (word senses) connected mainly by
Meaning-Text lexical function relations,
then introduce a hand-built lexical sys-
tem: the French Lexical Network or fr-
LN, a lexical resource that implements
a new lexicography of virtual dictionar-
ies. We later explain how a correspond-
ing en-LN has been generated from the
English WordNet. Finally, we propose a
topological contrastive analysis of the two
graphs showing that both structures can be
characterized as being Hierarchical Small
World Networks.

1.1 Context: the French Lexical Network
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989668344827586">
The RELIEF project (Lux-Pogodalla and Pol-
guère, 2011) is the first stage of a long-term
lexicographic enterprise that aims at developing
a broad-coverage French lexical resource: the
French Lexical Network, hereafter fr-LN. This re-
source possesses two main characteristics.
Firstly, it is the product of actual lexicographic
work but does not involve the writing of dictionary
articles. Rather, textual dictionary-like descrip-
tions can be automatically generated from linguis-
tic information contained in the fr-LN, which can
thus be considered as having embedded in it vir-
tual dictionaries. For comparable approaches to
the design of lexical resources, see for instance
Atkins (1996) and Spohr (2012).
Secondly, it possesses a very specific type of
graph structure called lexical system, conceptu-
alized in Polguère (2009). While WordNets are
before of all graphs of synsets, lexical systems
are graphs of specific word senses—i.e. lexical
units, in our terminology—, connected by a rich
set of lexical relations based on Meaning-Text lex-
ical functions (Mel’ˇcuk, 1996; Mel’ˇcuk, 2006).
For instance, below is a typical synset relation
taken from WordNet:
{army#1,regular army#1,ground forces#1}
membermeronym −−−−−−−−−−−−−→{corps#1, army corps#1}
whereas only lexical function relations holding be-
tween specific word senses such as:

→
exist in a lexical system.1
In addition, each piece of information in a lexi-
cal system (mainly, lexical nodes and lexical func-
tion arcs connecting nodes) is supplied with a trust
value, that is a measure of the validity of lex-
ical information. For instance, information di-
rectly entered by lexicographers receive high or,
even, maximal trust values, while information
automatically generated by analogy-based algo-
rithms should receive a low trust value. This al-
lows for the implementation of “fuzzy” reasoning
on lexical information.
At the time of writing, the fr-LN’s wordlist con-
tains 14,311 vocable entries—the term vocable
designates a (potentially) polysemic word—, and
20,791 lexical units—actual word senses. Com-
plete statistical data on the fr-LN are provided in

section 3, including data on lexical function rela-
tions that weave the lexical network. Notice that
these relations are not the only lexical connections
encoded in the fr-LN. Each idiom, i.e. phrasal
lexical unit, is connected to the lexemes it for-
mally contains. For instance, the noun POMME
DE TERRE ‘potato’ is connected to the correspond-
ing lexemes POMME ‘apple’, DE ‘of’ and TERRE
‘soil’, via the description of its internal syntactic
structure. Additionally, we have just started to en-
code copolysemy links: i.e. metonymy, metaphor,
etc. links that connect senses belonging to the
same vocable and form its polysemic structure.

The goal of this paper is to present an experi-
ment that we have conducted in order to automat-
ically generate an English Lexical Network, here-
after en-LN, from the English WordNet. Such task
presents some similarity with previous attempts at
compiling WordNet into specific data structures—
see for instance Graves &amp; Gutierrez (2005) and
Huang &amp; Zhou (2007). However, in our case, we
“transmute” WordNet data into an informational
content that is fundamentally different in nature.
One consequence is that information embedded
in WordNet that is “deeper” (more conceptual)
than strict linguistic knowledge is lost. This loss
of information is compensated by a very impor-
tant gain: a data structure that allows us to perform
lexicographic work on the English lexicon using
exactly the same advanced lexicographic tools we
are using in our fr-LN project (Gader et al., 2012).
In other words, we can perform a lexicographic
“graph weaving” activity on both French and En-
glish networks (cf. section 4).
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes how the task of compil-
ing the English WordNet into an en-LN has been
performed. Section 3 presents a contrastive topo-
logical analysis of the graph structure of both net-
works. Section 4 concludes on the practical inter-
est of our experiment.

<bodyText confidence="0.999831636363636">
The extraction of an English lexical system out of
WordNet’s data is a process of bridging the gap be-
tween two non-equivalent information structures.
The structure of lexical systems has been intro-
duced in section 1.1. The structure of WordNet
is well-known (Kamps, 2002) and a presentation
in the present context would be overkill. It is
however useful to summarize the main formal dif-
ferences that exist between our source and target
structures, i.e. to recapitulate our “one lexicon,
two structures” problematics: see Table 1 below.

Computationally, our source dataset was the
ANSI Prolog version of Princeton WordNet 3.0.
This Prolog version of WordNet is made up of
21 files, each containing a Prolog database that is
a set of Prolog “fact” clauses for a given predicate.
For instance, the wn_s.pl file contains 212,558
clauses for the s/6 Prolog predicate (the 6-place
s(ense) predicate), each clause encoding the de-
scription of one WordNet sense. The structure of
the s/6 predicate is described as follows in the
prologdb.5.pdf documentation file:
s(synset_id,w_num,’word’,
ss_type,sense_number,tag_count).
For example, the following Prolog clause:
s(107544351,4,
’infatuation’,n,2,0).
asserts that there exists a WordNet nominal sense
infatuation#2, that is the fourth sense in the
synset whose id is 107544351 and that was not
semantically tagged in WordNet’s Semantic Con-
cordances (Miller et al., 1993).
Out of the 21 Prolog files, 18 have been iden-
tified as containing information that could indeed
be translated into lexical system data.2 Such data
belong to three main categories: (i) lexical entities
(mainly, lexical units and vocables), (ii) individual
properties of lexical units (parts of speech, seman-
tic gloses, etc.) and (iii) lexical function relations
between lexical units.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.94955575">
2The three unused files are: wn_cls.pl (class rela-
tions between synsets), wn_sa.pl (rather heterogeneous re-
lations between verbal or adjectival senses) and wn_vgp.pl
(similarity relations between verbal synsets).

2.2 Generation of lexical data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999926">
For lack of space, we cannot account for all as-
pects of the compilation process. We focus on
the insertion of pieces of information into the en-
LN that are central to the characterization of this
database as a lexical system.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.905766">
2.2.1 Lexical entities
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999383933333333">
As shown earlier in Table 1 (section 2.1, above),
there are no lexical entities corresponding to
synsets in a lexical system. The nodes of such lex-
ical networks are mainly lexical units, i.e. words
taken in a well-specified meaning.
Our first task was to compile the en-LN’s
wordlist, i.e. the set of all its lexical units, grouped
under poly- or monosemic vocables. In order to
do so, we implemented the three following opera-
tions, using information from the wn_s.pl sense
file (presented in 2.1 above).
Operation 1 We had to perform a preliminary
clean-up of Prolog data, as we found a significant
number (5,580) of duplicated clauses in the s/6
predicate database.3
Operation 2 We then created one vocable (new
entry in the en-LN wordlist) for each distinct pair:
( word form, synset grammatical type ).
If there were two vocables with identical form
but different synset grammatical types, we added
the appropriate subscript to vocable names. For
instance, from the two pairs:
( ’package’, n ) and ( ’package’, v ),
we generated two distinct vocables: PACKAGEN
and PACKAGEV.
Operation 3 For each sense in the s/6 Pro-
log database, we created one lexical unit and con-
nected it to the corresponding vocable—based on
the ( word form, synset grammatical type ) pair
found in the Prolog clause for the WordNet sense.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.625417">
• If only one lexical unit was attached to
a given vocable, its WordNet sense num-
ber4 was ignored—e.g., we generated the
BACKGAMMON lexical unit in the corre-
sponding monosemic vocable.
3We actually discovered other errors in the Prolog files
(mainly, but not only duplicates) that we had to circumvent
in order to avoid the generation of inconsistent data in the
resulting en-LN. The list of errors can be provided on request.
4WordNet sense number is necessarily 1 in such cases.
• If several lexical units were attached to a vo-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.98215003030303">
cable, each one received the number of the
corresponding WordNet sense—e.g., we gen-
erated two lexical units, GEEK 1 and GEEK 2,
in the GEEK polysemic vocable.
The process of lexical entity generation re-
sulted in a huge fully disconnected graph (a cloud
of nodes without connecting arcs) comprising
206,976 lexical units—nodes in the graph— asso-
ciated to 156,584 vocables,5 which gives a poly-
semy rate of around 1.322.
To conclude on the topic of the generation of
lexical entities, it is important to recall that not all
WordNet senses are indeed lexical units. There is
a very significant quantity of phrasal entities6 in
WordNet’s synsets, and only a small proportion of
those phrases are actual idioms, i.e. lexical units
(Osherson and Fellbaum, 2010). The automatic
processing of WordNet data cannot separate true
idioms from compositional phrases, and a manual
post-processing of the en-LN will be necessary in
order to validate the en-LN wordlist.
Important remark Our data structure allows us
to specify a probability—understood as a measure
of trust value—for each piece of lexicographic in-
formation entered into the en-LN (cf. properties of
lexical systems, section 1.1 above). We have de-
cided that information that is automatically gener-
ated will receive a 0.5 probably. This is true for
the validity of vocables and lexical units, but also
for lexical links and individual properties of lex-
ical units that we have computed from WordNet.
This strategy boils down to considering the current
en-LN as being a “hypothesized lexical database.”
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.587506">
2.2.2 Individual properties of lexical units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94718706">
Five different types of individual properties have
been assigned to lexical units in the en-LN: so-
called WordNet “sense keys,” parts of speech, syn-
tactic features, semantic glosses and syntactic gov-
ernment patterns (subcategorization frames).
WordNet sense keys We found it essential to
encode in the en-LN the correspondence between
lexical units and WordNet senses, using WordNet
5Cf. section 1.1 above: vocables are considered as more
abstract lexical entities and are not counted as actual nodes of
the lexical graph.
6Phrasal senses are called collocations in WordNet termi-
nology. This is a different notion from that of collocation
understood as semi-phraseological expression—e.g. support
verb constructions such as take a nap (Benson, 1989).
IDs called sense keys. These IDs were extracted
from the wn_sk.pl Prolog file and encoded as
WordNet source features in the Grammatical Char-
acteristics zone of the en-LN lexicographic arti-
cles. For instance, the lexeme INFATUATION 2
has received the value ‘infatuation%1:12:02::’ as
WordNet source feature.
Semantic glosses In WordNet, semantic glosses
are associated to synsets and not to individual
senses. ( Synset, gloss ) pairs were extracted
from the wn_g.pl file and the en-LN article of
each member of a given synset received the same
gloss attribute. Computationally, glosses are sim-
ply stored as strings of characters in the Definition
lexicographic zone, more precisely in its Com-
ments section.
Parts of speech (POS) WordNet ‘synset types’
have been retrieved from the wn_s.pl Prolog
file and encoded as Part of speech features in
the Grammatical Characteristics zone. The corre-
spondence between WordNet synset type codes—
SType—and en-LN’s parts of speech—POS—is
given in Table 2 below.
SType POS
v ‘verb’
n ‘proper noun’ if name starts with a capital
letter, ‘common noun’ otherwise (of course,
a very approximate rule of thumb)
a and s ‘adjective’—we used only one part of
speech for adjectives as we consider that
WordNet’s class of satellite adjectives (s
type) pertains to WordNet internal organiza-
tion rather than to the identification of gram-
matical behavior
r ‘adverb’

<bodyText confidence="0.991192769230769">
Syntactic features Features corresponding to
information on syntactic behavior of adjectives
(syntactic role and linear positioning) were re-
trieved from the wn_syntax.pl Prolog file,
where they are associated to individual senses.
Table 3 below describes how this information
has been encoded as features in the Grammatical
Characteristics zone of the en-LN.
Syntactic government patterns We retrieved
associations between synsets and WordNet’s syn-
tactic frame codes in the wn_syntax.pl Pro-
log file. The definitions of syntactic frames them-
selves where taken from WordNet’s documenta-

tion (wninput.5.pdf file). Then, for each
sense member of a given verbal synset, we entered
the associated frame description into the Govern-
ment Pattern zone (Comments section) of the cor-
responding lexical unit.
Now that the generation of lexical properties has
been explained, let us move to the crucial topic
of weaving lexical function relations, that give the
en-LN its connected graph structure.

For lack of space, we focus below on the gener-
ation of only three lexical links, that are the most
significant statistically: Syne, Gener and Hypo.
Extraction of Syn∩ relations The Syn∩ lexical
function stands for ‘intersecting synonym’; its ex-
traction from WordNet was done as follows:
Secondly, Gener is more specific than Word-
Net’s hypernymy. It holds between two lexical
units in only two specific cases, illustrated below.
If sense ‘s’ belongs to synset S
And L‘s’ is the lexicalization of ‘s’
in the en-LN
Then the lexicalizations of all other senses
belonging to S are targets of Syn∩
links originating from L‘s’
And the same principle applies
recursively to all other senses of S.
This principle entails the “saturation” of all pos-
sible Syn∩ links among all elements of all synsets
in WordNets. And each application of this princi-
ple on a synset generates a saturated subgraph.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.607902">

graph generated from synset (1).

<bodyText confidence="0.990892">
We made the hypothesis that most synset mem-
bers in WordNet are connected by the intersect-
ing approximate synonymy relation Syn∩, rather
than by exact synonymy Syn. We expect that our
strategy will entail less manual corrections when
the en-LN will be used for lexicographic purposes
(section 4). Synset (1) is a clear illustration of the
potential relevance of our hypothesis, as senses in
(1) are indeed not exact synonyms.
Extraction of Gener — Hypo relations Gener is a
Meaning-Text standard lexical function and stands
for ‘generic term’. Though it is close to WordNet’s
hypernymy, it was not possible to systematically
extract Gener relations from WordNet’s hierarchi-
cal organization, for two reasons.
Firstly, the hypernymy relation holds between
synsets, whereas Gener connects lexical units.
A. FRUIT is a Gener of BANANA because it is
possible to say (2).
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.838782333333333">
(2) bananas, apples, oranges and other fruits
B. SUBSTANCE is a Gener of GAS because (3a)
can be paraphrased as (3b) using GASEOUS,
the adjectival counterpart of GAS.
(3) a. gas
b. gaseous substance
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994544733333333">
Gener is thus before all a lexical, rather than con-
ceptual or denotational relation. In the context
of our lexical projects, Gener is paired with a
symmetrical lexical function called Hypo, for ‘hy-
ponym’. Notice that this latter lexical function
does not belong to the original set of Meaning-
Text standard lexical functions.
Gener — Hypo relations were mainly ex-
tracted from hypernym relations between synsets
(wn_hyp.pl file) as follows:
If synset S1 is a hypernym of synset S2
And S1 is the hypernym of more
than 15 synsets
Then all senses of S1 are targets of Gener links
originating from of all senses of S2
And all senses of S2 are targets of Hypo
links originating from of all senses
of S1.
This ensures that there is no explosion of the
number of invalid Gener and Hypo links. After
doing some testing with different thresholds, we
reached the conclusion that a synset that happened
to be the hypernym of more than 15 other synsets
had the greatest chance to contain true generic
terms (in our sense).7
With this strategy, we caught in our nets “only”
111,032 Gener relations and the same number of
Hypo relations. Without the “&gt;15” constraint,
numbers would have been much higher and en-LN
data much less accurate.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.998788571428571">
7For instance, the WordNet sense car#1 belongs to a
synset that is the hypernym of 31 other synsets. It has thus
been identified as good candidate for generic term; as a result,
the corresponding lexical unit is the Gener of 66 other lexi-
cal units in the en-LN. In contrast, desk#1 belongs to a (sin-
gleton) synset that is the hypernym of only 3 other synsets; no
Gener link has been pulled from the DESK lexical unit.

<bodyText confidence="0.988715588235294">
A smaller set of Gener and Hypo relations
(69,696) has been extracted from instance→type
relations between nominal synsets (wn_ins.pl
file) based on the following principle:
If synset S1 is a type of synset S2
(that is its instance)
Then all senses of S1 are Gener
of all senses of S2
And all senses of S2 are Hypo
of all senses of S1.
To conclude this section, notice that the strate-
gies applied for extracting Syn∩, Gener and Hypo
relations—which implies symetric relations—are
chiefly responsible for the very high proportion of
“mutual arcs” in the graph—see section 3.1 below,
that presents a topological comparison of the fr-
and en-LNs.

lexicographic work on the fr-LN. In actual fact, we

Table 5 below shows the pedigree of our two
lexical systems.
The current fr-LN comprises 9.9 times less
nodes (n) than the English network—straight from
the oven—, for 27.1 times less arcs (m). To de-
termine if these densities are low, we compare m
to n2 and nlog(n). n2 is the maximum amount of
arcs that can exist for a given number of nodes and
a unique relation type.8 It is about 432 × 106 for
the fr-LN and 43 × 109 for the en-LN. From this
point of view, their densities are low. nlog(n) rep-
resents the order of magnitude of HSWN’s density
(Gaume, 2004). It is about 89,773 for the fr-LN,
which is twice the current amount. For the en-LN,
it is about 1,100,267, which is close to what we
measured.

the fr-LN and 12 in the en-LN. The maximum amount of arcs
increases proportionaly.

The en-LN has not undergone any evolution yet.
However, it will be manually transformed in the
future. Some arcs will be added and its propor-
tion of single nodes (2%) will decrease. Some
arcs will also be modified or deleted. For exam-
ple, its unique loop is a WordNet error and will be
eliminated from the en-LN (as it should be from
WordNet).10
The French network, which contains a wide va-
riety of links (662), has 44.6% of mutual arcs—i.e.
arcs a → b for which a reverse arc b → a exists.
They are many more in the en-LN (99.5%), due to

For our networks, C may seem small. However,
as Table 7 shows, they are higher than for simi-
lar classical random graphs (Newman, 2003). In
other words, these networks hold sets of highly
connected lexical units.
To assess the structure of these lexical agregates
in the network, we need to examine the distribu-
tion of degrees and the average path length (L).
As our networks are oriented, we focus only on
their out distribution of degrees. Both networks
follow a power law with a good correlation co-
efficient (r2). In Table 5 above, a stands for the
coefficient of the best fitting power law of these
distributions. Such a distribution is in the same
range as for typical HSWNs. This means that a
few number of lexical units are highly connected
to a slightly higher number of other lexical units,
themselves connected to a slightly higher number
of other lexical units. To put it differently, our net-
works contain lexical hubs and are hierarchically
structured.
Bollobás and Riordan (2004) have shown that
the L of HSWNs does not exceed logn/ log logn.
Such a value for L means that it is possible to move
rapidly from a node of the network to another.
As our networks have more than one compo-
nent, measure of their L is problematic (Newman,
2003). In fact, it is difficult to define a path length
between two non-connected nodes. A possible al-
ternative can be to consider the L of LCC (L_lcc).

Table 8 shows that L_lcc of our networks are
higher than expected. For the French network,
LCC is very small and probably not representative
of the whole network. For the English network,
the problem is different. The original structure
of WordNet keeps separate the synsets of the four
major parts of speech (with marginal transversal
connections). It is reasonable to believe that some
structuring lexical relations between agregates be-
longing to different parts of speech are missing.
To conclude, our fr- and en-LNs seem to be both
structured as HSWNs, but have an average path
length higher than they should have.

3.2 In layman terms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989357142857">
As indicated in section 3.1 above, the en-LN is
substantially larger than the current fr-LN. In con-
trast, lexical relations are more diverse in the latter.
Despite such differences, the global structure of
both networks appear to be similar. They seem
to represent the same type of lexical organization.
In both cases, senses are organized in highly con-
nected subsets and some lexical units assume a
pivotal role. These characteristics appear consis-
tent with a semantic field structure. Further in-
vestigation is required to learn more about highly
connected components, like the nature of links
and lexical units involved. Some new similarities
might then emerge.
The question of a fast and easy access between
lexical agregates remains. More detailed observa-
tion would be required to determine why such an
access is not possible in the LNs. The en-LN is
made up mostly of paradigmatic links. Maybe this
characteristic is the cause of our trouble. But this
explanation does not hold in the case of the fr-LN.
In a study of WordNet, where the different parts of
speech are structured together, Sigman and Cec-
chi (2002) propose to introduce polysemous links
to improve access between lexical units. We are
currently implementing the weaving of such links
in the fr-LN and more will be known soon about
their incidence on the global structuring of LNs.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999503125">
In form of conclusion, we summarize the practi-
cal interests of performing the WordNet → en-LN
compilation. Two main points should highlighted.
First and foremost, as stated in section 2.3, we
are able to wade through the en-LN and edit it us-
ing our “graph weaver:” the Dicet lexicographic
editor. This is essential to us as we believe that
the lexical system model ought to be extensively
tested as an alternative to more ontological ap-
proaches to lexical knowledge structuring, such as
WordNets.
Second, thanks to WordNet, we now have at our
disposal a lexical unit-based access to the English
lexicon that can be used to explore structural be-
havior of full-scale lexical systems, in anticipation
of the fr-LN reaching lexicographic maturity.

This resource possesses two main characteristics. Firstly, it is the product of actual lexicographic work but does not involve the writing of dictionary articles. Rather, textual dictionary-like descriptions can be automatically generated from linguistic information contained in the fr-LN, which can thus be considered as having embedded in it virtual dictionaries. For comparable approaches to the design of lexical resources, see for instance Atkins (1996) and Spohr (2012). Secondly, it possesses a very specific type of graph structure called lexical system, conceptualized in Polguère (2009). While WordNets are before of all graphs of synsets, lexical systems are graphs of specific word senses—i.e. lexical units, in our terminology—, connected by a rich set of lexical relations based on Meaning-Text lexical functions (Mel’ˇcuk, 1996; Mel’ˇcuk, 2006). For instance, below is a typical synset relation taken from WordNet: {army#1,regular army#1,ground forces#1} membermeronym −−−−−−−−−−−−−→{corps#1, army corps#1} whereas only lexical function relati</context>

This is a different notion from that of collocation understood as semi-phraseological expression—e.g. support verb constructions such as take a nap (Benson, 1989). IDs called sense keys. These IDs were extracted from the wn_sk.pl Prolog file and encoded as WordNet source features in the Grammatical Characteristics zone of the en-LN lexicographic articles. For instance, the lexeme INFATUATION 2 has received the value ‘infatuation%1:12:02::’ as WordNet source feature. Semantic glosses In WordNet, semantic glosses are associated to synsets and not to individual senses.

However, in our case, we “transmute” WordNet data into an informational content that is fundamentally different in nature. One consequence is that information embedded in WordNet that is “deeper” (more conceptual) than strict linguistic knowledge is lost. This loss of information is compensated by a very important gain: a data structure that allows us to perform lexicographic work on the English lexicon using exactly the same advanced lexicographic tools we are using in our fr-LN project (Gader et al., 2012). In other words, we can perform a lexicographic “graph weaving” activity on both French and English networks (cf. section 4). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

This script performs topological analyses—called graph pedigrees—, that allow for rigorous graph characterization and comparison. More specifically, we seek to determine if the fr-/en-LNs are Hierarchical Small World Networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Newman, 2003; Gaume, 2004). Hierarchical Small World Networks, hereafter HSWN, exhibit four properties: 1. low density, i.e. small number of arcs compared to the number of nodes; 2. high global clustering coefficient, i.e. high number of connected neighbor nodes; 3. distribution of degrees (probability distribution of number of arcs associated to a node) that follows a power law; 4. low average path length, i.e. small average minimal number of arcs between two nodes for each possible pairs.

Such task presents some similarity with previous attempts at compiling WordNet into specific data structures— see for instance Graves &amp; Gutierrez (2005) and Huang &amp; Zhou (2007). However, in our case, we “transmute” WordNet data into an informational content that is fundamentally different in nature. One consequence is that information embedded in WordNet that is “deeper” (more conceptual) than strict linguistic knowledge is lost. This loss of information is compensated by a very important gain: a data structure that allows us to perform lexicographic work on the English lexicon using exactly the same advanced lexicographic tools we are using in our fr-LN project (Gader et al., 2012). In other words, we can perform a lexicographic “graph weavi</context>

The structure of lexical systems has been introduced in section 1.1. The structure of WordNet is well-known (Kamps, 2002) and a presentation in the present context would be overkill. It is however useful to summarize the main formal differences that exist between our source and target structures, i.e. to recapitulate our “one lexicon, two structures” problematics: see Table 1 below.

However, as Table 7 shows, they are higher than for similar classical random graphs (Newman, 2003). In other words, these networks hold sets of highly connected lexical units. To assess the structure of these lexical agregates in the network, we need to examine the distribution of degrees and the average path length (L). As our networks are oriented, we focus only on their out distribution of degrees. Both networks follow a power law with a good correlation coefficient (r2). In Table 5 above, a stands for the coefficient of the best fitting power law of these distributions. Such a distribution is in the same range as for typical HSWNs.

The process of lexical entity generation resulted in a huge fully disconnected graph (a cloud of nodes without connecting arcs) comprising 206,976 lexical units—nodes in the graph— associated to 156,584 vocables,5 which gives a polysemy rate of around 1.322. To conclude on the topic of the generation of lexical entities, it is important to recall that not all WordNet senses are indeed lexical units. There is a very significant quantity of phrasal entities6 in WordNet’s synsets, and only a small proportion of those phrases are actual idioms, i.e. lexical units (Osherson and Fellbaum, 2010). The automatic processing of WordNet data cannot separate true idioms from compositional phrases, and a manual post-processing of the en-LN will be necessary in order to validate the en-LN wordlist. Important remark Our data structure allows us to specify a probability—understood as a measure of trust value—for each piece of lexicographic information entered into the en-LN (cf. properties of lexical systems, section 1.1 above). We have decided that information that is automatically generated will receive a 0.5 probably. This is true for the validity of vocables and lexical units, but also for</context>

They can be grouped into three different classes: • 7 standard lexical functions: Syne, Antie, Gener, Mult, Sing, A2 and Caus; • 4 that have been “standardized” (Polguère, 2007) in the context of previous projects: Cf, Hypo, Holo and Mero; • 1 non-standard: Unspecified derivative.

Some new similarities might then emerge. The question of a fast and easy access between lexical agregates remains. More detailed observation would be required to determine why such an access is not possible in the LNs. The en-LN is made up mostly of paradigmatic links. Maybe this characteristic is the cause of our trouble. But this explanation does not hold in the case of the fr-LN. In a study of WordNet, where the different parts of speech are structured together, Sigman and Cecchi (2002) propose to introduce polysemous links to improve access between lexical units. We are currently implementing the weaving of such links in the fr-LN and more will be known soon about their incidence on the global structuring of LNs. 4 So what gives? In form of conclusion, we summarize the practical interests of performing the WordNet → en-LN compilation. Two main points should highlighted.

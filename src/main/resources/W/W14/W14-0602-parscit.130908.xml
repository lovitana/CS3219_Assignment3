We describe on-going work towards publishing
language resources included in dialectal dictionaries
in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, and so to
support wider access to the diverse cultural data
associated with such dictionary entries, like the
various historical and geographical variations of the
use of such words. Beyond this, our approach allows
the cross-linking of entries of dialectal dictionaries on
the basis of the semantic representation of their
senses, and also to link the entries of the dialectal
dictionaries to lexical senses available in the LOD
framework. This paper focuses on the description of
the steps leading to a SKOS-XL and lemon encoding
of the entries of two Austrian dialectal dictionaries,
and how this work supports their cross-linking and
linking to other language data in the LOD.

<bodyText confidence="0.999629">
The starting point for our work is given by two
Austrian dialectal dictionaries: The Dictionary of
Bavarian dialects of Austria (Wörterbuch der
bairischen Mundarten in Österreich, WBÖ)1 and
the Dictionary of the Viennese dialect
(Wörterbuch der Wiener Mundart, WWM) 2 .
Both dictionaries have been made available to us
in an electronic version: WBÖ in a proprietary
XML schema and WWM in Microsoft Word. We

of this dictionary in the Linked Data 5 cloud
(Wandl-Vogt &amp; Declerck, 2013). We used
recently a similar approach for porting the TEI
Version of the WWM dictionary into SKOS,
leading to few modifications in our previous
model.
A motivation for this additional step was to
investigate if our SKOS-based model can support
the (automatised) cross-linking of the dialectal
dictionary data6. In this particular case, we can
take advantage of a property of dialectal
dictionaries concerning the expression of
meanings of entries: Although conceived as
monolingual reference works, dialectal
dictionaries share with bilingual dictionaries the
fact that they express the meanings of their
entries in a different language. The meta-
language for expressing the meanings of entries
in both WBÖ and WWM is Standard German,
sometimes accompanied by Austrian German.
This is exemplified in the WBÖ entry “Puss” in
Table 1 above, which is using both the Standard
German “Kudl” and the Austrian German
“Busserl” for expressing one meaning of the
word “Puss” (this meaning being “kiss”). Other
meanings are “Gebäck” and “PflN”7. Additional
lines for the entry “Puss” in WBÖ, not displayed
in this submission due to lack of space, are
giving more details on those meanings, précising
that in the “Gebäck” case we deal with a small
sweet pastry (“Kl. südles Gebäck”) and in the
“PflN” case with a “bellis perennis” flower.8
The related entry in WWM dictionary is
“Bussal”, which is displayed in Table 2.
(http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/)
5 For more details see http://linkeddata.org/.
6 The topic of “cross-linking” is in fact very relevant
to lexicographers, as can be seen in (Wandl-Vogt,
2005).
7 The word “Gebäck” (pastry) is Standard German
and the string “PflN” is an abbreviation for the
German name “Pflanzenname” (name of a plant)
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.592477666666667">
8 More details are given in (Author2 &amp; Author1, 2013). We
concentrate in this submission on the sense “small sweet
pastry” to exemplify our approach.

We can see that this entry carries two meanings,
which are the same as the two first meanings of
the WBÖ entry “Puss”. Linking entries in
distinct dialectal dictionaries can thus be
implemented on the basis of meanings that are
shared across the dictionaries. But, while for the
second meaning the readers familiar with the
German language will immediately recognize
that both strings “Kl. südles Gebäck” (WBÖ) and
“kleines Südlgebäck” (WWM) have the same
meaning, this is not evident for other readers and
for computer program that should cross-link the
dictionary data from those two sources.
In order to automatically cross-link entries from
both dictionaries, we wrote first a program for
extracting the strings expressing the meanings
for each entry and applied an algorithm for
comparing the extracted strings. For this latter
task, it is necessary to first linguistically analyse
the strings, since pure string matching cannot
provide accurate comparisons: lemma reduction
and PoS tagging are giving additional indicators
for matching strings expressing meanings. To
mark linguistically analysed meanings as related,
use also semantic representation languages
developed in the context of W3C standardization,
more specifically SKOS-XL9 and lemon10

We wrote for the extraction of strings marking

state platform 11 . This included tokenization,
lemmatisation, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
and constituency as well as dependency analysis.
The strings marking in both dictionaries the
“sweet pastry” meaning are enriched with the
following linguistic features:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.977002666666667">
WBÖ: (NP süWes (ADJ, lemma = süW, MOD)
Gebäck (N, lemma = Gebäck, HEAD))
WWM: (NP (kleines (ADJ, lemma = klein,
MOD) SüWgebäck (N, compound: süW (ADJ,
lemma = süW, MOD) + Gebäck (N, lemma =
Gebäck, HEAD)), HEAD))
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930714285714">
In those examples (sweet pastry and small sweet
pastry), we can see the distinct serializations of
similar meanings in German. The second
example uses a compound noun (“SüBgebäck”),
which has the same meaning as the simple
nominal phrase in the first example (“süBes
Gebäck”). In order to automatically establish this
similarity, it is necessary to perform a
morphological decomposition of the head noun
in the second example. It is also necessary to
have the lemma of the adjective in the first
example, in order to compare it with the first
element of the compound noun in the second
example.
The fact, that both linguistically analysed
meanings (strings) share the same lemmas for
adjectival modifiers and head nouns is the basis
for cross-linking the entries. This cross-linking
has to be expressed in Semantic Web standards
(e.g. compatible to RDF) in order to be published
in the Linked Data cloud.

3.1 Porting the dictionaries into SKOS
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994575">
Analogue to the described SKOSification of
WBÖ (see Wandl-Vogt &amp; Declerck, 2013), the
WWM was ported into SKOS. Departing from
the former experiment, we decided to not encode
anymore the whole dictionary as a SKOS
concept scheme. Rather we introduce the listing
of entries (each encoded as a skos:Concept) as
being member of a skos:Collection.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.358139">
11 See http://www.nooj4nlp.net/pages/nooj.html
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893541666667">
Complementary to this, extracted senses (see
former section) are each encoded as
skos:Concept being included in a
skos:ConceptScheme. This decision is due to the
fact that the senses can be organized along the
line of (SKOS) semantic relations, whereas the
strings marking the entries are in fact just
member of a list, which is building the dictionary.
The headword (string) of the dictionary entries is
encoded as a value of the SKOS-XL prefLabel
property. Alternative strings (like “Bussi” in the
WWM example in Table 2) are encoded with the
SKOS-XL altLabel property. The use of SKOS-
XL allows us to “reify” the value of the range of
the label properties, and thus to have there not
only a literal but further information, like PoS.
Since senses are also represented in the
dictionaries by strings, we apply the same
procedure: a sense has skos-xl labels in which we
can encode the lemma of the components of the
strings, the corresponding PoS but also related
senses, within the local concept scheme or in the
LOD, like for example with objects in the
DBpedia instantiation of Wiktionary12.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99983">
3.2 Representing the meanings in lemon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999324833333333">
The linguistically analysed meanings cannot
be (straightforwardly) represented in SKOS,
and for this we opted for the lemon model,
which has been developed specifically for
the purpose of representing linguistic
information of lexical entries related to
knowledge organization systems. The lemon
encoding of the meanings is incorporated as
the value of the SKOS-XL “Label” property.
Taking as an example the one meaning of
“Puss” in WBÖ that consists of two words
(“süBes Gebäck”, sweet pastry), we can see
that it is for necessary to tokenize the string
representing the meaning of the entry
“Puss”: the first token can then be
lemmatized to “süB” (sweet), while for the
second token the lemma is identical to the
written form used. We represent the

<footnote confidence="0.999303">
12 So for example the sense „Kuss“ for both the
entries „Puss“ and „Bussal“ is declared as being a
skos:exactMatch with the URL:
http://wiktionary.dbpedia.org/page/Kuss-German-
Noun-1de. From there we can get then all multilingual
equivalents listed in this resource.

4 Cross referencing of dictionary
entries through similar meanings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989454545455">
The establishment of a relation between “Puss”
in WBÖ and “Bussal” in WWM is made possible
on the base of the successful mapping of both the
adjectival modifier “süff” and the head noun
“Gebäck”, which are present in both the
definitions in WBÖ and WWM. This similarity
is encoded using the “related” property of SKOS.
Interesting is also the fact that a user searching
the electronic version of the dictionaries could
give the High German form “Gebäck” and would
get from both dictionaries all the entries which
have this word in their definition. The same for
the High German adjectival form “süff”.
Instead of the meanings we extracted from the
dictionaries, we can use the DBpedia
instantiation of Wiktionary as a reference for the
senses of the entries of the dictionary, pointing
directly to linguistic and knowledge objects that
are already in the LOD. Using the
“decomposition” and “subSenses” properties of
lemon, we link to URLs in DBpedia/Wiktionary
representing the sense for each token.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965301391304348">
We described the actual state of
RDF/SKOS/lemon modeling of (senses of)
entries of dialectal dictionaries, so that those
entries can be cross-linked via their similar
senses. We have shown that NL processing of
the strings for marking the meanings of the
entries is necessary in order to make them
comparable. We further have shown that our
encoding of the entries of the dictionaries is also
supporting the linking to already existing lexical
senses and other language data in the LOD. The
model have been implemented in the TopBraider
composer13 and all the entries of the dictionaries,
as instances of the defined classes and properties,
are automatically mapped onto the corresponding
Turtle syntax14 and will be made available very
soon as deferentiable URLs, making thus less-

resourced language data available in the LOD.
Future work will consist in applying a similar
approach to historical and geographical contexts
given in the entries of the dialectal dictionaries.

Additional lines for the entry “Puss” in WBÖ, not displayed in this submission due to lack of space, are giving more details on those meanings, précising that in the “Gebäck” case we deal with a small sweet pastry (“Kl. südles Gebäck”) and in the “PflN” case with a “bellis perennis” flower.8 The related entry in WWM dictionary is “Bussal”, which is displayed in Table 2. (http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) 5 For more details see http://linkeddata.org/. 6 The topic of “cross-linking” is in fact very relevant to lexicographers, as can be seen in (Wandl-Vogt, 2005). 7 The word “Gebäck” (pastry) is Standard German and the string “PflN” is an abbreviation for the German name “Pflanzenname” (name of a plant) 8 More details are given in (Author2 &amp; Author1, 2013). We concentrate in this submission on the sense “small sweet pastry” to exemplify our approach. Table 2: The related entry in the WWM dictionary Bussal, Bussi, Bussl, das, 1) Kuss (Syn.: Schm$tss); 2) kleines Süßgebäck; Pl. Bussaln; viele Komp. wie Iussbussal usw. – We can see that this entry carries two meanings, which are the same as the two first meanings of the WBÖ entry “Puss”. Linking entries </context>

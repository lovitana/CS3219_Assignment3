1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999655272727273">
Since the first release of the Princeton WordNet
(PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) there has been a great in-
crease in the size and number of wordnets created
(Bond and Paik, 2012). Further, there has been an
empirical revolution in natural language process-
ing (Vanderwende and Menezes, 2005), with ma-
chine learning based on annotated corpora domi-
nating the field. Given this, we would expect to
see a flowering of sense annotated corpora. How-
ever, they are still relatively rare and small in size
compared to part-of-speech and tree banked cor-
pora (Petrolito and Bond, 2014).
In this paper we describe ongoing work to sense
annotate data in two languages (English and Chi-
nese), using texts provided by the Ianyang Tech-
nological University Multilingual Corpus (NTU-
MC: Tan and Bond, 2012). We discuss some of
the problems involved with pre-processing (Sec-
tion 3), monolingual sense tagging (Section 4) and
multi-lingually linking the data (Section 5). We
then discuss some ideas to improve the annotation
process (Section 6) and conclude.

Sense-tagged parallel corpora are an important re-
source for NLP, contrastive linguistics and bilin-
gual lexicography. However, there are few multi-
lingual sense tagged corpora. One notable excep-
tion is the MultiSemCor (Pianta et al., 2002). Tak-
ing the English SemCor (Landes et al., 1998) as a
source, first Italian, then Romanian and Japanese
translations have been made. The leading project
was the Italian SemCor with 268,905 Italian to-
kens and 258,499 English tokens (Pianta et al.,
2002). This was followed by the Romanian Sem-
Cor with 175,603 tokens in Romanian matched
with 178,499 English tokens (Lupu et al., 2005).
Finally, the Japanese SemCor has senses projected
across from English. Of the 150,555 content
words, 58,265 are sense tagged either as monose-
mous words or by projecting from the English an-
notation (Bond et al., 2012).
Some universities have devoted efforts to con-
struct Chinese-English parallel corpora, such as
Peking University, Tsinghua University and Chi-
nese Academy of Sciences (Chang et al., 2003;
Chang, 2004), Xiamen University (Chen et al.,
2005, 2006), Beijing Foreign Studies University
(Wang, 2012). However, none of them are sensed
tagged or aligned at word level. Chinese-English
word aligned corpora are available as part of many
statistical machine translation projects, but we
wanted to work with a multilingual corpus, not just
two languages.
Rather than translate new data, we took advan-
tage of an existing multilingual corpus contain-
ing eight languages: English (eng), Mandarin Chi-
nese (cmn), Japanese (jpn), Indonesian (ind), Ko-
rean, Arabic, Vietnamese and Thai (Tan and Bond,
2012). Parallel data in English, Chinese, Japanese,
and Indonesian are selected for further annotation,
which is composed of three genres: short stories,
essays and tourism.
The Princeton Wordnet is an important resource
in natural language processing, psychology, and
language studies. It was developed from 1985
at Princeton University. Nouns, verbs, adjective
and adverbs were grouped into synsets and linked
through semantic relation (Fellbaum, 1998). We
used Southeast University’s Chinese Wordnet to
tag the Chinese part (SEW: Xu et al., 2008),1 and
are now in the process of switching to the Chinese
Open Wordnet (COW: Wang and Bond, 2013).2

In this paper we talk only about the Chinese
and English text from the short story, essay and
tourism genres of the NTU-MC, although we are
also cooperating with other work on tagging In-
donesian and Japanese (Bond et al., 2013). The
short stories are two Sherlock Holmes’ Adven-
tures (The Adventure of the Dancing Men and
The Adventure of the Speckled Band), the essay is
The Cathedral and the Bazaar (Raymond, 1999)
and the tourism data is from the Singapore tourist
board’s web pages (Singapore Tourist Board,
2012). The corpus sizes are shown in Table 1. We
show the number of sentences, words and concepts
(open class words taggable with synsets).

3.1 Pre-processing with NLP Tools

<bodyText confidence="0.999016">
For English, Freeling (Padr´o et al., 2010) was
run with number processing, name recognition,
multi-words, dates and quantities all turned off.
Turning them on gave quite aggressive lemmati-
zation: for example a bit in a bit of honest money
was lemmatized to IF bit:1 “one bit of informa-
tion”. We did very minimal preprocessing: for
example rewriting three hyphens - -- to mdash
—. We had some problems with lemmatization
of hyphenated expressions and mdashes: white-
counterpaned which we would like to treat as
two lemmas (white and counterpane) and not—
because which should be treated as not and be-
cause. We ended up correcting many of these by
hand.
For Chinese, we segmented and tagged with the
Stanford NLP tools (Chang et al., 2008).3 We did
some post-processing: many punctuation marks
were not recognized (such as: [〔&amp;quot;()--
these we corrected with a script after the ini-
tial POS tagging. We also lemmatized plural-
marked nouns, such as *生+们 xu´esh¯eng+men
“student+s” to *生 xu´esh¯eng “student”. This

Finally, we preprocess the Chinese wordnet by

3.2 Identifying Concepts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9888418125">
We add potential concepts as a separate layer,
linked to the words (like terms in KAF: Bosma
et al., 2009).
We identify concepts in two ways: words or
multi-word expressions (MWEs) that are in word-
net or any single open class words not yet matched
(these are tagged as unknown).
A word may potentially be part of multiple con-
cepts (single and multi-word). For example dis-
tribution in Gaussian or Poisson distributions is
marked as being part of Gaussian distribution,
Poisson distribution and distribution. Concepts
can be discontinuous (like Gaussian distribution
above), we allow up to three extra words to inter-
vene. After preliminary trials, we decided to ig-
nore POS tags when matching words to concepts
(see Section 3.4 for more discussion).
Our concepts comprise of single content words
and MWE. Words fall into four major categories:
n, v, a, r, following the standard wordnet structure.
We show examples in Table 2.
Various heuristics were employed to make the
matching flexible. For single word entries in
wordnet, we match on lemmas, not using the
wordnet form variants. If we can find no match for
the lemma, then we try to match the surface form.
All matching is done with lower-cased entries. For
English, we further process entries with hyphens
to produce extra forms without the hyphen: data-
base will also match database and data base.
For multiword expressions, we index them by
the first token. If that matches either lemma or

kens, the Chinese Penn Treebank consistently treats these as
one token (Xia, 2000).

surface form we then continue to match the re-
maining tokens, allowing up to three intervening
tokens. We must check both surface and lemmas
to deal with cases such as programming language
which is lemmatized to programVV languageNN.
Other wordnet taggers we tested have missed
many MWEs, for example, Freeling will not rec-
ognize look up in look the word up.
Sag et al. (2002) classified MWE into lexical-
ized phrases and institutionalized phrases. The
former can be grouped into fixed expressions,
semi-fixed expressions and syntactically-flexible
expressions; the latter includes anti-collocations
and collocations. All of these types are found in
our corpus, as shown in Table 3.
Our matching is still imperfect. It is too loose
for fixed expressions: for example, there will
never be anything (except for expletives, which
can also come within words) between ad and hoc
(or for and example). It therefore matches many
MWEs which the annotators need to discard. It
is too rigid for syntactically-flexible expressions,
which can have their order changed (e.g. by pas-
sivization) and thus misses some entries.

3.3 Distribution of Concepts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999207">
Table 4 shows the number of concepts in the three
genres of essay, story and tourism for both Chi-
nese and English. In each of the three subcor-
pora, Chinese has more concepts than English,
possibly because our tagging of unknown words
is less precise. We show how many are found in
the wordnets (in WN: PWN for English, SEW for
Chinese): the remainder are unknown open class
words. The coverage is best for the stories and
slightly worse for the essay (which has many tech-
nical terms, such as developer “one who programs
computers or designs software”). It is much worse
for the Singapore tourist data, which introduces
many new concepts, such as ikan bilis “an Indone-
sian dish made with fried anchovies and peanuts”,
mooncake “a kind of Chinese cake eaten around
the Autumn festival”, Merlion “the statue that
symbolizes Singapore” and many more. The cov-
erage is worse for Chinese, as the wordnet is not as
well developed. In addition, there are many words
lexicalized in Chinese but not in English, for ex-
ample, 去年 q`uni´an ‘last year’. Further, there are
many English foreign words in the tourism corpus,
which makes the coverage even worse. Finally we
show the number of concepts for which the anno-
tators chose a single wordnet sense. Not all un-
tagged words should be tagged however: they may
be mis-identified as MWEs or open class words,
named entities, mis-tokenizations or concepts not
currently in wordnet.

3.4 Part of Speech Issues
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984259259259">
For our tagging interface, we looked up wordnet
using the lemma of a word. This caused problems
when the word was mis-tagged giving the wrong
lemma. The well-known problematic cases of
present and past-participles. For example, draw-
ing in “Have you that fresh drawing?” was tagged
as VBG with lemma draw although it should have
been drawing (NN). In this case, the annotators
have the option of specifying the noun synset, but
the first version of our tool currently did not al-
low them to fix the POS and lemma.5 In gen-
eral, the annotators found distinguishing between
gerunds, adjective and participles hard. For exam-
ple in dancing men (referring to pictures of little
men that look as though they are dancing): should
this be the noun dancingn:1 “making a series of
rhythmical steps (and movements) in time to mu-
sic” or the verb dancev:2 “move in a pattern; usu-
ally to musical accompaniment”? These are linked
by a derivational link, so are clearly related. We
decided on a general strategy and tried to make
the decision process as clear as possible in the tag-
ging guidelines, revising them with more exam-
ples. The annotators should first check if the con-
text makes the word clearly an adjective, verb or
noun, and if so pick the appropriate sense based on
this. If the word is ambiguous in context, first pre-

Similar guidelines were written for other confus-

We show the confusion matrices of wordnet part
of speech versus lemmatizer tag (simplified to the
four wordnet parts of speech and other (z) for Chi-

In general, the POS tagger could not be relied
on. The annotators picked a different tag from the
system 24.1% of the time for Chinese and 11.1%
of the time for English. This shows how poorly
POS taggers perform outside the domains they are
trained on: real-world accuracy is between 80 and

4 Monolingual Sense Tagging
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978666666667">
Our annotators (for both the monolingual and
cross-lingual sense tagging) were undergraduate
students (and recent graduates) from the linguis-
tics and multilingual studies division at Nanyang
Technological University. All were bilingual
Chinese-English speakers and several had good
command of Japanese. Most had experience tag-
ging as part of the core semantics class, where a
tagging exercise is used to teach about lexical se-
mantics.
The annotators chose between existing wordnet
senses based on the lemma senses or a number of
meta-tags: e, s, m, p, u. The expectation was that
after the tagging, there would be a round of word-
net extension, and then the words with new word-
net entries would be tagged once more.
Their meaning is explained below, and their dis-
tribution is given in Table 7.

(i) if the lemma is a multiword, this tag means
it is not appropriate;
(ii) if the lemma is single-word, this tag
means it should be part of a multiword.
The first two errors are those where the sys-
tem has wrongly offered a word to be tagged, or
the morphological processing has failed in some
way. Because the annotators had no training in
part of speech tagging, they were instructed to
note the error (with a comment is possible) and
these would be fixed and then re-tagged later. We
have not done a full analysis, but a preliminary
investigation suggests that modal auxiliaries and
prepositions were the most common p and e tags.
In general the annotators found it hard to distin-
guish between p and e: we are trying to make
the guidelines clearer. The distinguishing criteria
should be e means that the annotation should be
fixed in some way, while p just means there is no
need to annotate: the annotators had trouble mak-
ing this distinction. The annotators often marked
existential there and exclamatives (like ah!) as s
“should add to wordnet”, we have updated the tag-
ging guidelines to make this clearer. Although the
Penn treebank tag set does distinguish between ex-
istential and referential there, we check both any-
way as the pos tagging is unreliable. However,
to speed up tagging, because existential there and
preposition in are so often p we pre-mark these
entries as p before annotation. Further, although
the tags do not distinguish between auxiliaries and
main verbs, we found it fairly easy to identify
them with simple patterns: such as, V:[have|be]
V:VBG|VBN. We used these patterns to also pre-
mark these entries as p.
Those marked with s and u are missed cases in
either PWN or SEW. We can see from Table 7
that the Chinese wordnet (SEW) has many more
missed senses and lemmas compared to PWN.
This is one reason that we are switching to the
Chinese Open Wordnet (COW) which has better
accuracy and coverage (Wang and Bond, 2013).
One goal of the annotation is to improve the
wordnets by adding the new words and senses, and
we are working on this in parallel with the anno-
tation. Anything tagged s or u is thus a possible
new addition to wordnet. There were 1,375 such
tags for English and 24,594 for Chinese. How-
ever, if we look at the distinct lemmas, then there
are far fewer: 799 for English and 7,691 for Chi-

nese. This gives us a rough estimate of how many
new entries need to be created.
We looked at a random sample of 50 entries (to-
kens) marked s or u and found the situation en-
couraging, only 30% really required new entries.
We summarize the results in Table 8, giving the
correct tag, percentage, explanation and example.
As discussed above, some exclamatives, exis-
tentials and other things that should not be tagged
were marked with s. More problematically, the an-
notators often marked Watson (Sherlock Holmes’s
companion) with s, although they had been in-
structed to mark proper names with p. Here, al-
though technically an error, we are sympathetic:
Sherlock Holmes is in wordnet, and John Watson
seems prominent enough to add.
In some cases, even where they had correctly
marked the multiword, they marked the single
words as s not m. This is just an error. For exam-
ple in (1), sendforv:1 was correctly annotated, and
send should be marked as m “part of multiword”
rather than s.

ample: it was not a good idea. In some cases, we
thought that the definition should be made clearer
(often less dogmatic) in order to make the scope
of the sense wider. For example in (4), wordnet
has backern:1 “invests in a theatrical production”,
as a hyponym of patronn:1. We feel this could be
expanded to “a person who invests in something,
such as a theatrical production”, avoiding the con-
struction of a new sense.

5 Cross-lingual Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951765957447">
For the second round of annotation, instead of go-
ing over the monolingual texts again, we decided
to look at the sense annotation in the translation
context.
For each sentence, we automatically linked
words with either: the same concept (=); if still
unlinked then a matching hypernym or hyponym
(&lt;, &gt;); if still unlinked then the same lemma (this
was useful even between English and Chinese as
technical terms (such as Linux) were often left in
the Latin alphabet). We did not use word-to-word
tags in the tagging because (i) they were unavail-
able and (ii) we already had the monolingual tags
on each side, so we did not need to project the tags.
In future work, we would like to investigate the
use of word-links (following the lead of Bentivogli
and Pianta (2005)).
The annotators then went through sentence-pair
by sentence-pair and (i) checked existing links
then (ii) tried to link unlinked concepts. They cat-
egorized links into the six types shown in Table 9.
The annotators were instructed not to overthink
the decision as to link-type: we can recalculate the
distinctions using the wordnet structure.
This annotation has only been completed for the
Essay and Story genres, we show the numbers of
links, and the total number of taggable concepts,
in Table 10. The proportion of things linked is
very low: 61% for the stories and 39% for the es-
say. We have automatically calculated the types
of links: if the tag is exactly the same, then =;
hyponyms and hypernyms are shown with &lt; and
&gt;; derivationally related forms and pertainyms
found in wordnet with d; other linked tags with
different parts-of-speech with D; holonyms with
m; meronyms with M; antonyms found in wordnet
with !; those the annotator marked as antonyms but
we could not find in wordnet with # and everything
else with ∼. The large number of part-of-speech
mismatches suggests that we still do not have all
the cross part-of-speech links in wordnet that we
should.
An example of why things remain unlinked is
shown in (7): concepts are marked with subscripts,
linked concepts have the same subscript and are
upper case. way and question can be linked, but

Often, there were differences in lexicalization
that made the question of what to link difficult. For
example in (8), 前额 qi´an’´e “forehead” is lexical-
ized, and it matches to a unit that is not in PWN,
“the front of ones brain”. This is almost certainly
not lexicalized in English. So we end up linking
qi´an’´e to brain with ≈ and then front has noth-
ing to link to. We need to be able to link words to
phrases without necessarily adding the phrases to
the wordnets.

6 Discussion and Further Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999915">
We have been gradually improving the tagging
guidelines as we continue with the annotation, and
will make these available online along with the
corpus.6 In particular, we are adding more exam-
ples for each case. We benefited from the cheat
sheet and guidelines produced for the Gloss Cor-
pus (Fellbaum pc.) and hope our guidelines can
help other people. With this in mind, we are trying
to keep separate, as far as possible, tool-specific
procedures and general tagging guidelines.
Many of the unknown words, especially for our
first attempt, were in fact words that are in word-
net with minor typographical variations: for ex-
ample tool kit in wordnet as toolkit.7 We have
added various heuristics to improve the look up
within wordnet. We also started to work on im-
proving the tokenization, but decided this was too
large a task. Instead, we are looking at exploit-
ing a more semantically aware tokenizer (Dridan
and Oepen, 2012). Similarly for Chinese, we are
comparing a wider variety of tokenizers. One re-
viewer suggested that there are more accurate pro-
prietary pos taggers and segmenters available for
Chinese. Unfortunately, the fact that they are not
freely available means that we cannot test them to
see if they are better. Our experience with English,

where we have more experience with state-of-the-
art systems is that (i) they do not do well with
out-of-domain data (a well-known failing) and (ii)
they often do not mark distinctions important for
the sense tagging (for example, the difference be-
tween main and auxiliary verbs). We therefore
prefer to work with open-source systems that we
can evaluate and potentially improve.
In this paper, we mainly discuss a breadth first
approach, where we are trying to increase the cov-
erage uniformly to cover all words. We do not re-
port on the inter-annotator agreement, as the first
rounds of tagging (which we report on here) are
not the final annotation: all tags are checked once
more as we do the cross-lingual annotation, and it
is too expensive to do this multiple times.
We are also using the corpora as a test-bed to
look at individual phenomena of interest in detail,
including the use of Chinese traditional idiomatic
expressions (成i ch´engyˇu), English possessive
idioms (X looses X’s head) and the differences in
pronoun distribution across languages.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989">
This paper presents preliminary results from an
ongoing project to construct large-scale sense-
tagged parallel corpora. The annotation scheme is
divided into two phrases: monolingual sense an-
notation and multilingual concept alignment. We
look at some of the issues raised for Chinese and
English annotation of text in three genres. All an-
notated corpora will be made freely available, in
addition, the changes made to the wordnets will be
released through the individual wordnet projects.

Further, there has been an empirical revolution in natural language processing (Vanderwende and Menezes, 2005), with machine learning based on annotated corpora dominating the field. Given this, we would expect to see a flowering of sense annotated corpora. However, they are still relatively rare and small in size compared to part-of-speech and tree banked corpora (Petrolito and Bond, 2014). In this paper we describe ongoing work to sense annotate data in two languages (English and Chinese), using texts provided by the Ianyang Technological University Multilingual Corpus (NTUMC: Tan and Bond</context>

Nouns, verbs, adjective and adverbs were grouped into synsets and linked through semantic relation (Fellbaum, 1998). We used Southeast University’s Chinese Wordnet to tag the Chinese part (SEW: Xu et al., 2008),1 and are now in the process of switching to the Chinese Open Wordnet (COW: Wang and Bond, 2013).2 3 Pre-processing the Corpus In this paper we talk only about the Chinese and English text from the short story, essay and tourism genres of the NTU-MC, although we are also cooperating with other work on tagging Indonesian and Japanese (Bond et al., 2013). The short stories are two Sherlock Holmes’ Adventures (The Adventure of the Dancing Men and The Adventure of the Speckled Band), the essay is The Cathedral and the Bazaar (Raymond, 1999) and the tourism data is from the Singapore tourist board’s web pages (Singapore Tourist Board, 2012).

We identify concepts in two ways: words or multi-word expressions (MWEs) that are in wordnet or any single open class words not yet matched (these are tagged as unknown). A word may potentially be part of multiple concepts (single and multi-word). For example distribution in Gaussian or Poisson distributions is marked as being part of Gaussian distribution, Poisson distribution and distribution. Concepts can be discontinuous (like Gaussian distribution above), we allow up to three extra words to intervene.

With this in mind, we are trying to keep separate, as far as possible, tool-specific procedures and general tagging guidelines. Many of the unknown words, especially for our first attempt, were in fact words that are in wordnet with minor typographical variations: for example tool kit in wordnet as toolkit.7 We have added various heuristics to improve the look up within wordnet. We also started to work on improving the tokenization, but decided this was too large a task. Instead, we are looking at exploiting a more semantically aware tokenizer (Dridan and Oepen, 2012). Similarly for Chinese, we are comparing a wider variety of tokenizers. One reviewer suggested that there are more accurate proprietary pos taggers and segmenters available for Chinese. Unfortunately, the fact that they are not freely available means that we cannot test them to see if they are better.

Further, there has been an empirical revolution in natural language processing (Vanderwende and Menezes, 2005), with machine learning based on annotated corpora dominating the field. Given this, we would expect to see a flowering of sense annotated corpora. However, they are still relatively rare and small in size compared to part-of-speech and tree banked corpora (Petrolito and Bond, 2014). In this paper we describe ongoing work to sense annotate data in two languages (English and Chinese), using texts provided by the Ianyang Technological University Multilingual Corpus (NTUMC: Tan and Bond, 2012). We discuss some of the problems involved with pre-processing (Section 3), monolingual sense tagging (Section 4) and multi-lingually linking the data (Section 5).

However, they are still relatively rare and small in size compared to part-of-speech and tree banked corpora (Petrolito and Bond, 2014). In this paper we describe ongoing work to sense annotate data in two languages (English and Chinese), using texts provided by the Ianyang Technological University Multilingual Corpus (NTUMC: Tan and Bond, 2012). We discuss some of the problems involved with pre-processing (Section 3), monolingual sense tagging (Section 4) and multi-lingually linking the data (Section 5).

We have preliminary results for three genres: stories, essays and tourism web pages, in both Chinese and English. 1 Introduction Since the first release of the Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998) there has been a great increase in the size and number of wordnets created (Bond and Paik, 2012). Further, there has been an empirical revolution in natural language processing (Vanderwende and Menezes, 2005), with machine learning based on annotated corpora dominating the field. Given this, we would expect to see a flowering of sense annotated corpora. However, they are still relatively rare and small in size compared to part-of-speech and tree banked corpora (Petrolito and Bond, 2014).

The Princeton Wordnet is an important resource in natural language processing, psychology, and language studies. It was developed from 1985 at Princeton University. Nouns, verbs, adjective and adverbs were grouped into synsets and linked through semantic relation (Fellbaum, 1998). We used Southeast University’s Chinese Wordnet to tag the Chinese part (SEW: Xu et al., 2008),1 and are now in the process of switching to the Chinese Open Wordnet (COW: Wang and Bond, 2013).2 3 Pre-processing the Corpus In this paper we talk only about the Chinese and English text from the short story, essay and tourism genres of the NTU-MC, although we are also cooperating with other work on tagging Indonesian and Japanese (Bond et al., 2013). The short stories are two Sherlock Holmes’ Adventures (The Adventure of the Dancing Men and The Adventure of the Speckled Band), the essay is The Cathedral and the Bazaar (Raymond, 1999) and the tourism data is from the Singapore tourist board’s web pages (Singapore Tourist Board, 2012). The corpus sizes are shown in Table 1. We show the </context>

Further, although the tags do not distinguish between auxiliaries and main verbs, we found it fairly easy to identify them with simple patterns: such as, V:[have|be] V:VBG|VBN. We used these patterns to also premark these entries as p. Those marked with s and u are missed cases in either PWN or SEW. We can see from Table 7 that the Chinese wordnet (SEW) has many more missed senses and lemmas compared to PWN. This is one reason that we are switching to the Chinese Open Wordnet (COW) which has better accuracy and coverage (Wang and Bond, 2013). One goal of the annotation is to improve the wordnets by adding the new words and senses, and we are working on this in parallel with the annotation. Anything tagged s or u is thus a possible new addition to wordnet. There were 1,375 such tags for English and 24,594 for Chinese. However, if we look at the distinct lemmas, then there are far fewer: 799 for English and 7,691 for ChiTag % Type (Example) p 38 Shouldn’t be tagged (ah) m 10 Part of known multiword (send for) e 6 Wrong tokenization/lemmatization uptimes → uptime tag 14 Existing sense is ok (idean:1) u 16 New lemma (mattern:1) s 16 </context>

For single word entries in wordnet, we match on lemmas, not using the wordnet form variants. If we can find no match for the lemma, then we try to match the surface form. All matching is done with lower-cased entries. For English, we further process entries with hyphens to produce extra forms without the hyphen: database will also match database and data base. For multiword expressions, we index them by the first token. If that matches either lemma or 4In some segmentation standards these would be two tokens, the Chinese Penn Treebank consistently treats these as one token (Xia, 2000).

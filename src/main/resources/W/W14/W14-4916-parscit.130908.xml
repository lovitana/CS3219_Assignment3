1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99966680952381">
Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is the first discourse-annotated corpus of Turkish, which follows the
principles of Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) and includes annotations for dis-
course connectives, their arguments, modifiers and supplements of the arguments. The TDB is built on
a ~ 400,000-word sub-corpus of METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al., 2002), a 2 million-word
multi-genre corpus of post-1990 written Turkish1.
In both PDTB and TDB, the discourse connectives link two text spans that can be interpreted as, or
can be anaphorically resolved to abstract objects (Asher, 2003). The PDTB includes annotations for both
explicit and implicit connectives, whereas TDB has covered only explicit connectives so far.
The explicit discourse connectives annotated in TDB come from a variety of syntactic classes, namely
coordinating conjunctions (ve ‘and’), subordinating conjunctions (iVin ‘for/since’) and discourse adver-
bials (ancak ‘however’). It also annotates phrasal expressions (Zeyrek et al, 2013).
The coordinating and subordinating conjunctions are ‘structural’ discourse connectives that take their
arguments syntactically, whereas discourse adverbials only take one argument syntactically, and the
other one anaphorically (Forbes-Riley et al. 2006). For all syntactic types, the argument that syntacti-
cally accommodates the discourse connective is called the second argument (Arg2). The other argument
is called the first argument (Arg1). In TDB, phrasal expressions consist of an anaphoric element and a
subordinating conjunction. In PTDB, similar expressions are annotated as AltLex, a subtype of implicit
connectives (Prasad et al. 2008). For example, onun iVin ‘because of that’ in (1) is annotated as a dis-
course connective with its two argument spans. In the rest of the paper, the connective is underlined, the
Arg2 is in bold face, and Arg1 is shown in italics. Supplementary materials and modifiers are shown in
square brackets labelled with subscripts when necessary.

“That is a recording device. I have homework. Because of that I’m recording you right
now.”
The TDB has chosen to annotate these expressions as discourse connectives because they are highly
frequent and have limited compositional productivity. Furthermore, some phrasal expressions such as
bunun aksine ‘contrary to this’, aksi takdirde ‘however’ are so frequent that the native speakers perceive
them as single lexical entries.
In an attempt to extend the PDTB/TDB style discourse annotation to spoken Turkish, we have anno-
tated the search tokens in TDB on the Spoken Turkish Corpus (STC) (Ruhi et al.2009; 2010) demo
version2. Following the TDB conventions, we annotated the phrasal expressions such as onun iVin ‘be-
cause of that’ and ondan sonra ‘after that’. The annotation of 77 search tokens identified in TDB yielded
a total of 416 relations in the STC demo.
In this paper we first present the data from the STC demo release, the method we used for annotations,
and issues and challenges we have met. Then we present our preliminary findings. Finally, we discuss
the methods and the findings of the study and draw a road map for future work.

2.1 The Data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919333333333">
The Spoken Turkish Corpus demo version is a ~20,000-word resource of spoken Turkish. The demo
version contains 23 recordings amounting to 2 hours 27 minutes. Twenty of the recordings include cas-
ual conversations and encounters, comprising 2 hours 1 minutes of the total, the 3 remaining recordings
are broadcasts lasting a total of 26 minutes. The casual conversations include a variety of situations such
as conversations among families, relatives and friends, and service encounters. The broadcasts are news
commentaries. The topics of conversation range from daily activities such as infant care and naming
babies to biology e.g. the endocrine system, to politics such as European Union membership process or
the clearing of the mine fields on Syrian border. Such wide range of topics provide for a wide coverage
of possible uses of discourse connectives even in such a relatively small corpus.

2.2 Annotation Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861222222222">
Since our main aim was to follow the PDTB/TDB style, we chose to use the Discourse Annotation Tool
for Turkish (DATT) (Aktaş et al., 2010). We used the transcription texts included in the STC demo
version as the DATT input and provided the annotators with separate audio files.
This approach was a trade-off: the annotators could not make use of the rich features of the time-
aligned annotation of the STC; but by importing text transcripts directly into an existing specialized
annotation tool we did not have to go through any software development and/or integration stage. The
annotators reported only slight discomfort in matching the text and the audio file during annotation, but
stated that it was manageable as none of the files are long enough to get lost between the two environ-
ments.

2.3 Issues and Challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994926">
Some of the challenges of annotating discourse connectives we have already observed in written lan-
guage transfer to the spoken modality. For example, in written discourse it is possible for an expression
to be ambiguous between a discourse and non-discourse use, as the anaphoric elements can refer to both
abstract objects and non-abstract entities. This applies to spoken language as well.

“SER000062: Um Glomerulus was (this) the name of that round ball? Stuff happens there ...
AFI000061: Yes, yes.
AFI000061: Filtration occurs after that, though. That Loop of Henle and such. Reverse like
this.”
In (2) ondan sonra ‘after that’ could be interpreted as resolving to the clause ‘Stuff happens there’,
which is an abstract object although a vague one. The pronoun can also refer to the glomerulus, which
is an NP. This was exactly the case during the annotation of this specific example: one annotator inter-
preted it as a temporal discourse connective that indicates the order of two sub-processes of kidney
function, whereas the other annotator interpreted that o ‘that’ refers to the NP and did not annotate this
instance of ondan sonra. As a TDB principle, if an expression has at least one discourse connective
meaning, it is annotated. As a result, this example was annotated as per the first annotator’s annotation.
In spoken language, particularly spontaneous casual dialogues, phrasal expressions can take their first
arguments from anywhere in the previous discourse. This is very much like discourse adverbials. For
example, iVin in (3) displays an unattested use in TDB, as it appears distant from both its arguments,
allowing the participant to question the discourse relation between two previous text spans. Given the
supplemental material “thyroxin increases the metabolism” in line (a) by speaker AFI, speaker SER
provides two propositions, “thyroxin is secreted by the thyroid gland” in line (b) and “people with over-
active thyroids tend to be hyperactive” in line (e). In line (h), AFI offers a discourse connective “be-
cause” in order to show her understanding of the preceding discourse, i.e., something like ‘(so they tend
to be very active) because of that?’, where the material in parentheses are elided. One can argue that this
connective builds a new discourse relation with one anaphoric and one elliptic argument. Nevertheless,
we kept the annotations as shown in the example, because (a) it was the most intuitive annotation ac-
cording to the annotators and (b) the DATT does not allow annotation of ellipsis as arguments for now.

Another problem with spoken corpus is that some elements may be missing. There are many examples
that could not be annotated as discourse connectives, because the speakers were interrupted before they
could complete, or at times even start, the latter argument of a possible discourse relation. In other
examples, the argument may be there but not recorded clearly, or may be completely inaudible even
though they were uttered because of background noise or overlapping arguments.

3 Preliminary Findings
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997528625">
In this section we present some of our preliminary findings and compare them to the TDB to the extent
possible. Because of the large difference in size between the two corpora, we converted the raw numbers
to frequencies. We used number/1000 words as the frequency unit in Table 1.
The top five most frequent connectives in the TDB in descending order are ve ‘and’, iVin ‘for’, ama
‘but’, sonra ‘later’ and ancak ‘however’ and the top five most frequent connectives in the STC are ama
‘but’, ve ‘and’, mesela ‘for example’, sonra ‘later’ and iVin ‘for’. Here we compare the four most
frequent connectives, namely, ve, iVin, ama and sonra, which make up 4951 (58.3%) of the total 8484
annotations in TDB and 217 (52.2%) of the total 416 relations annotated in the STC.

Although both the frequency of the total occurrences of the connectives and their discourse uses seem
to be lower in the spoken corpus, chi square tests show that the differences are not statically significant
(p&gt;0.5). The percentage of the use of tokens as discourse connectives across modalities is not significant
either (p&gt;0.5). The preliminary results indicate that the distribution of these five connectives and their
uses as discourse connective are similar in written and spoken language.
The similarity is expected, as the MTC and the subcorpus that the TDB is built on are multi-genre
corpora. Specifically, the TDB includes novels and stories, which in turn include dialogues. Also, there
are interviews in news excerpts, which are basically transcriptions of spoken language. As a result, the
TDB texts reflect some aspects of spoken language. In addition, 3 of the 23 files of the STC demo are
news broadcasts and interviews, which are probably scripted and/or prepared. Thus they may not nec-
essarily reflect all aspects of spontaneous spoken language.

4 Discussion and Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999649833333333">
In this paper we presented a preliminary attempt at annotating Turkish Spoken Language in PDTB/TDB
style. We used the transcripts and audio files of STC demo as our source, and used DATT of TDB to
annotate the discourse relations. As future work, we intend to integrate the discourse annotation to the
time-aligned annotation of the STC, thus allowing the users to benefit from the features of both annota-
tion schemes.
During the annotation process, we encountered the use of discourse connectives unattested in TDB,
specifically iVin ‘since/for’ in a predicative/interrogative position, where the connective occurs with its
deictic Arg1. We assume that the question in which this connective is used has a rhetorical role, possibly
expressing the speaker’s understanding of the discourse relation in the previous discourse. Apart from
this newly attested use, the distribution of the search tokens and their use as discourse connectives re-
main largely similar to that of the TDB. We conclude that this similarity results from the fact that the
TDB includes some features of the spoken language just as the STC demo may include scripted record-
ing. Yet, we suspect that the occurrence of discourse connectives with a deictic Arg1 is quite frequent
in spoken language. We leave the investigation of such occurrences, and other issues such as the genre
breakdown of the frequency of discourse connectives in STC for further study.
Our goal for the near future is to complete at least a second set of double-blind annotations and the
agreement statics on the STC, so that the discourse-level annotation of spoken Turkish can be compared
to those of the TDB.

The TDB is built on a ~ 400,000-word sub-corpus of METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al., 2002), a 2 million-word multi-genre corpus of post-1990 written Turkish1.

For all syntactic types, the argument that syntactically accommodates the discourse connective is called the second argument (Arg2). The other argument is called the first argument (Arg1). In TDB, phrasal expressions consist of an anaphoric element and a subordinating conjunction. In PTDB, similar expressions are annotated as AltLex, a subtype of implicit connectives (Prasad et al. 2008). For example, onun iVin ‘because of that’ in (1) is annotated as a discourse connective with its two argument spans. In the rest of the paper, the connective is underlined, the Arg2 is in bold face, and Arg1 is shown in italics. Supplementary materials and modifiers are shown in square brackets labelled with subscripts when necessary. 1 The MTC and the TDB are freely available to researches at http://ii.metu.edu.tr/corpus and http://medid.ii.metu.edu.tr, respectively.

We present the preliminary findings suggesting that the distribution of the search tokens and their use as discourse connectives are similar in the TDB and the STC demo. 1 Introduction Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) is the first discourse-annotated corpus of Turkish, which follows the principles of Penn Discourse Tree Bank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) and includes annotations for discourse connectives, their arguments, modifiers and supplements of the arguments. The TDB is built on a ~ 400,000-word sub-corpus of METU Turkish Corpus (MTC) (Say et al., 2002), a 2 million-word multi-genre corpus of post-1990 written Turkish1. In both PDTB and TDB, the discourse connectives link two text spans that can be interpreted as, or can be anaphorically resolved to abstract objects (Asher, 2003). The PDTB includes annotations for both explicit and implicit connectives, whereas TDB has covered only explicit connectives so far. The explicit discourse connectives annotated in TDB come from a variety of syntactic classes, namely coordinating conjunctions (ve ‘and’), subordinating conjunctions (iVin ‘for/since’) and discourse adverbials (ancak ‘however’).

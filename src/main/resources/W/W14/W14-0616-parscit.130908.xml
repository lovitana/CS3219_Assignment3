In this paper we have investigated the syl-
labic structures found in Aromanian a
Romance language spoken in the Balkans
across multiple countries with important
communities which spread from Greece
to Romania. We have created a dictio-
nary of syllabified words and analyzed a
few general quantitative and phonological
aspects of the dictionary. Furthermore,
we have approached the syllabic complex-
ities, the sonority patterns present in the
syllable’s constituents and the degree in
which the Sonority Sequencing Principle
(SSP) holds for this language. Based on
all the information gathered we have de-
vised an automatic syllabification algo-
rithm which has a 99% accuracy on the
words in the dictionary. In this way we
hope to extend the existing phonological
studies on Eastern Romance and to spread
and preserve meta-linguistic information
on this endangered language.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852807692308">
Aromanian, according to linguists (Papahagi,
1974) or (Saramandu, 1984) is part of a larger
family of Eastern Romance languages consisting
from Daco-Romanian (standard Romanian), Aro-
manian, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian.
We underline this characteristic because some of
the linguistic properties that are present in Aroma-
nian are also present, more or less, in the other
three languages largely due to the common histor-
ical and linguistic context in which they formed
and evolved. Unfortunately, Istro-Romanian and
Megleno-Romanian are labeled by the UNESCO
Red Book (2010) as “severely endangered” lan-
guages with approximately 300 (Filipi, 2002)
and respectively 5000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002).
Aromanian is not in a better situation carrying
the label of “definitely endangered” with approx-
imately 500,000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002). Cur-
rently, the language has no accepted standard, be-
ing written in various forms depending on social
and political factors of the regions in which it is
spoken (Kahl, 2006). This is why we believe that
a study on Aromanian can only be done empiri-
cally, on corpus data or dictionaries or by adopting
a multi-valued dialectal approach justified by field
work.

Although Capidan (1932) offers an exhaustive
study on Aromanian with valuable comments on
previous research, very few modern linguistic
studies target this language and there are no com-
putational linguistic studies as far as we are aware
at this point. Caragiu-Marioiean (1968) offered
one of the first modern studies with respect to the
phonology and structural morphology of the lan-
guage; her work represents our linguistic base-
line. Since Aromanian is spoken in various re-
gions, there are expected geographical particular-
ities. Caragiu-Marioieanu (1997) classifies the
Aromanian sub-dialects into two types: type F -
the variants that resemble the Farsherot, predomi-
nant in Albania and some parts of Greece and type
A - all the other variants. She argues that type F
sub-dialects are spoken by smaller communities
which have been influenced by type A. Type F sub-
dialects have certain phonetic features: the closed-
central vowel [1] does not exist, the groups of con-
sonants [rl], [rn] are transformed into a sound that
could be classified as a velar [r] (Capidan, 1932)
and the diphthongs [e“a] and [o“a] are transformed
into [e] and [o].

3 Dictionary of syllables

<bodyText confidence="0.99984047368421">
The dictionary used in our study is compiled
by Cunia (2010) from the dictionaries of Papa-
hagi (1974) and the one of Dalametra (1906). The
main advantage of this resource is its lexical rich-
ness, including specific variants of words known
by the author. Moreover, for most of the words,
the syllabification is reproduced from a different
dictionary compiled by Papahagi (1974). The later
is considered a valuable and reliable linguistic re-
source for this language. The final size of the
dictionary has approximately 69.000 syllabified
words. Among the disadvantages, we could count
a significant amount of misspelled words (that we
have manually corrected), and words syllabified
incorrectly. Also, the dictionary is written with the
orthography proposed by Cunia (1997) using an
alphabet that has only one diacritic. The purpose
of the alphabet is to be more practical in the digi-
tal era, departing from other related phonemically
spelled languages like Italian or Spanish. One of
the main drawbacks of this alphabet is the com-
pression of two different sounds (the mid-central
vowel [@] and the closed-central vowel [1]) into
the letter “˜a”, leaving the reader to decide which
phoneme is actually used. The motivation behind
the compression comes from the two vowels being
geographical allophones for Aromanian (depend-
ing on type F or type A sub-dialect). In this case
we should be cautious when analyzing vowels as
phonological units. This is not the only case where
orthography can influence our study.
Aromanian, together with Romanian (Chi-
toran, 2001), contrasts diphthongs [e“a], [o“a] from
semivowel (glide) to vowel sequences [ja] and
[wa] (written here as [i“a] and [u“a]). This means
that the phonological representation of diphthongs
is the one proposed by Chitoran (2002): both ele-
ments of the diphthong are represented as sharing
a syllable nucleus. According to this representa-
tion, diphthongs are predicted to function as a sin-
gle unit and a single segment.
The orthography of our dictionary restricts us
to partially operate with these distinctions. Simi-
lar to Romanian (Chitoran, 2001), the glide-vowel
sequence [u“a] is less frequent - in our dictionary
with less than 100 occurrences - compared to the
larger number of occurrences for the diphthong
[o“a]. However, other dictionaries like the one
of Caragiu-Marioieanu (1997), which is complete
only to the letter ’D’, uses a different orthography
and the actual contrasts might differ from resource
to resource. Since this doesn’t guarantee consis-
tent results we represent internally all the above
pairs as single units in the nucleus.
In the current state, the exact phonetic value of
the letter “˜a” is ambiguous and the disambiguation
is a non-trivial task unless parallel resources are
available.
To overcome the difficulty of using a specific
alphabet, we have decided to convert the entire set
of consonants from Latin script into IPA (Interna-
tional Phonetic Alphabet). The consonant inven-
tory of Aromanian is detailed in Table 1, the same
alphabet is used internally to store the syllabified
words. Our representation does not have the same
amount of detail as a phonetic transcription would,
instead, it offers a general unified format which
could be used by linguists in future studies. Our
dictionary also contains the accented vowels and a
distinction between [u, e, o, i] and the semivowels
[u“, e“, o“, i“].
The palatalized pairs of consonants [c]—[é] and
[ç]—[J] are to be found only before [i, i“, e, e“] ac-
cording to Caragiu-Marioieanu (1968). In all the
other places the velar ones will be encountered.

<bodyText confidence="0.999949470588235">
Both Aromanian and Romanian share a large de-
gree of common features, but no comparative stud-
ies have been made on the CV (here: consonant-
vowel) structures available in the two languages.
For Romanian, a database of syllables was already
provided by (Barbu, 2008) under the title “RoSyl-
labiDict”. This database contains almost all the
morphological forms of Romanian words. Among
the existing studies with respect to the CV struc-
tures in Romanian we count the one of Dinu and
Dinu (2006). Comparing two grammatically sim-
ilar languages in terms of the distribution of CV
units can bring a new perspective on the simi-
larities at the phonological level. In CV-theory
(Clements and Keyser, 1983) a syllable σ is rep-
resented in a three-tier form.
For example the word “rat”:

<bodyText confidence="0.999645083333333">
The CV structures are a part of the phonological
layer in the universal grammar and the most com-
mon one, encountered in all the natural languages
is the “cv” structure . In Table 2, both Romanian
and Aromanian have this structure as the most fre-
quent one. Theoretically, the four primary types of
CV-structures are “cv”, “v”, “cvc” and “vc”. The
CV-theory (Clements and Keyser, 1983) predicts
that if a language has “vc” syllables then all the
other three primary structures will be encountered
in that language.
In Table 2, it’s not unusual to see CV structures
of the form [ccvcv], this is because the standard
Romanian orthography, as opposed to English in
most of the cases, makes no distinction between
the grapheme of a semivowel and the one of a
vowel. If the CV structure has the following form
[ccvcv] then the second “v” is a glide. In our inter-
nal representation of our dictionary two glides can
be encountered at the end of syllables: [i“] the mark
for plural in all the Romanian dialects and [u“] - fre-
quently emphasized in the texts since the first Aro-
manian writers of the eighteen century (Papahagi,
1909).

4.2 Menzerath-Altmann law

<bodyText confidence="0.999920833333333">
Menzerath-Altmann law (Altman, 1980) states
that the size of a linguistic construct is inversely
correlated with the size of its constituents. Which
means, in this particular case, that the average
size of a word in syllables increases as the aver-
age size of the syllable (in phonemes) decreases.
Previous studies proved that this law has appli-
cability for more general linguistic constructs, in
syntax (Buk, 2007) and even beyond linguistics in
genome structures (Baixeries et al., 2013). In the
syllable-phoneme context, extensive studies have
been made. Fenk et al. (2006) investigated this
law on 33 different languages and found an ac-
tive correlation between the CV complexity of the
syllables and the decay of the ratio between num-
ber of syllable and number of phonemes per syl-
lable. In this sense, we have investigated the re-
lation between Romanian and Aromanian with re-

spect to the Menzerath-Altmann law. We used the
“RoSyllabiDict” dictionary of Romanian syllables
compiled by Barbu (2008). This dictionary is con-
structed from almost all the morphological word-
forms in Romanian, having a considerable size of
about 520.000 entries.
The results can be visualized in Figure 1 - Ro-
manian has a smaller average length of syllables,
somewhere close to 4 but a significantly larger av-
erage length of words - close to 11. While Aroma-
nian has a slightly larger length of syllables, close
to 4.5 but the length of the words does not exceed
7 syllables in average. Moreover, Romanian is a
highly developed language containing a vast set
of neologisms and loans that can affect the word
length. While Aromanian is more an archaic lan-
guage spoken in small communities usually used
between family members lacking the lexical rich-
ness of a general-use language. On one hand,
Aromanian has a smaller average length of words
than its developed relative, on the other hand, at
the phonological level, even though the decay is
similar (overlapping most of the times), Aroma-
nian presents a slightly larger length of syllables
(in phonemes). This suggests that Aromanian is
slightly more complex in terms of syllable phono-
tactics than Romanian.

4.3 The structure of the syllable
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9723722">
In order to investigate the complexity and diversity
of the syllables in Aromanian, we have chosen to
examine the constituents of the syllables in terms
of sonority sequences. Phonetically, the spoken
chain consists in waves of sonority or sound in-
tensity (Lehmann, 2005). The Sequence Sonority
Principle (SSP) (Clements, 1990) regards the syl-
lable as the phonological unit behind the waves of
sonority. A representation of this concept can be
visualized in Figure 2.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999208">
Figure 2: The sonority wave
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823916666667">
The sonority of a phoneme can be regarded
as “its loudness relative to that of other sounds
with the same length, stress, and pitch” (Lade-
foged, 1975). The sonority is given by a con-
cept called strength (Escure, 1977), on one side
strength can be represented by the sonorance in
which the phonemes are ordered by their acoustic
energy: Stops → Fricatives → Nasals → Liquids
→ Glides → Vowels. On the other side, the scale
can be represented by the articulatory resistance
(Anderson and Ewen, 1987) of the phonemes as
in Figure 3.

sonority while the syllable’s boundaries consists
of phonemes of low sonority. In almost every nat-
ural language there are exceptions to this princi-
ple and investigating it can be valuable in speech
recognition and in automatic syllabification based
on phonotactic rules (Frampton, 2011). If the ex-
ceptions are accounted then the number of sonor-
ity peaks in a word is correlated with the number
of syllables. In the same manner, the number of
syllable boundaries is correlated with the number
of low sonority phonemes.
As previously mentioned, the “cv” structure is
universal in every language, thus the syllable may
have two basic constituents (Fudge 1969, 1987):
an onset (governed by the consonant) and a rhyme
(governed by the vowel). The rhyme is further di-
vided into a nucleus (forming the syllable’s sonor-
ity peak) and a coda (consonants of descending
sonority), the following schema exemplifying the
word “tram” is relevant to the definition:
σ
determined while the semivowel [u“] is a partic-
ular feature of Aromanian. Table 3 contains the
percentages regarding the sonority of the codas.
Because of the final glides, a large number of co-
das (41%) will break the SSP by having a sonor-
ity reversal (a sequence of phonemes in ascend-
ing sonority inside the coda). Mixed codas have
a sequence of phonemes that is neither ascending
neither descending.

Given that the presence of these glides in word-

alects, we decided to adopt the following structure
of the coda for word-final syllables:

A constituent (onset, nucleus, coda) is branch-
ing if multiple phonemes are to be found in its
structure and non branching if it is constructed
from a single unit. Onsets and codas in Aroma-
nian can be empty (syllable made of nucleus only -
“v”), branching (two or more consonants “ccv” for
onsets and “vcc” rarely for coda) or non-branching
(“cvc” - the most frequent construct, single conso-
nant only). In Table 2 the CV structures already
suggested this fact. Compared to codas, the on-
sets in these languages tend to be more complex
branching in up to three consonants.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990702">
4.4 Sonority and the coda
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979777777778">
The first observation arises with respect to the
Aromanian coda and the fact that it can end in
glides [i“] and [u“]. This creates a peak of sonor-
ity inside the structure of the coda, thus a sonority
reversal right at the end of the syllable. In this sit-
uation the SSP is broken since the sonority is not
decreasing towards the end boundary of the syl-
lable. These types of codas appear in final syl-
lables, the semivowel [i“] being morphologically

Using this design we have also investigated the
sonority of the coda in its “Cons” structure which
is limited in Aromanian to not having more than
two consonants.
It was noticeable to observed that the SSP is
always obeyed by the “Cons” substructure of the
coda.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.977546">
4.5 Sonority and the onset
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974">
All the results so far, indicate that the coda is
not a very complex structure in this language. In
fact, Caragiu-Mariot¸eanu (1968) stated that Aro-
manian previously had open syllables. A fact at-
tested in the early works of the eighteenth century
writers (Papahagi, 1909) describing the syllables
as being opened. The linguistic study of Davis
and Baertsch (2011) offers a model in which the
structure of the onset is related to that of the coda
through a shared component called margin. The
model predicts that a complex onset in a language

or u
requires the presence of a coda (Kaye and Lowen-
stamm, 1981). For Aromanian, in particular, the
formation of the coda could be a result of the in-
creased complexity of the onsets.
We have investigated the different patterns of
sonorities found in onsets, Table 4 contains the
percentages of each of these patterns. Aromanian
has four types of sonority sequences in the onset:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9905226">
• “Constant” −→ - one or more consonants
(sonority plateau) with equal sonorities
• “Ascending” / - a sequence of phonemes
with ascending sonorities
• “Descending” \ - a sequence of phonemes
with descending sonorities
• “Nadir” \/ - a sequence in which the
sonority descends and then rises towards
the nucleus (e.g. the onset “mbr” or other
Nasal+Stop+Liquid)

<bodyText confidence="0.998872909090909">
The “Constant” and “Ascending” sequences of
sonorities in onsets obviously obey the SSP and
they count as the majority in the language. The as-
cending onsets can take the following forms: [bl],
[br], [dr], [6r], [fl], [flf&apos;1, [fr], [gl], [glf], [gn],
[gr], [yl], [yn], [yr], [kl], [kf], [kr], [ks], [kf],
[p0, [pl], [pf], [pr], [ps], [sl], [sm], [tl], [tr],
[tsr], [vl], [vr], [xl], [x f], [xr], [zl], [zm], [zn],
[zn], [6r] from which the onsets ending in nasal
consonants (i.e. [n], [m] or [p]) are found only in
word initial syllables.
About 5% of the onsets can be classified as ex-
ceptions from the SSP and the majority of them
are to be found in word-initial syllables. In word-
medial syllables we could count only rare exam-
ples of fricative + stop clusters. The descending
consonant clusters in the onsets can be constructed
by the patterns in Table 5.
The most interesting phonotactic constraint to
mention is related to “Nadir” onsets - all of them
appear only in word initial syllables. Intuitively,
we may consider these onsets as being constructed

feature of the sounds. The phonemes tend to clus-
ter together depending on the voice (e.g. [z] being
a voiced consonant is more likely to be encoun-
tered near other voiced consonants - [b], [d], [g] or
[�]).
from two types of clusters: on one hand “Descend-
ing” + “Constant” onset clusters and on the other
hand “Constant” + “Ascending” onset clusters.
Quantitatively, the two approaches are equiva-
lent and have the following form:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.894227733333333">
1. “Descending” onset cluster + liquid ([l], [�]
or [r])
2. [m], [n], [s], [f], [z] + “Ascending” onset
cluster
From a linguistic perspective the onsets that do
not respect the SSP can be analyzed using the con-
cept of semysillable. Cho and King (2008) pro-
posed this model of a syllable by imposing certain
restrictions:
• no nucleus
• no codas
• no stress/accent/tone
• prosodically invisible
• well-formed onset clusters (observing SSP)
• restricted to morpheme peripheral positions
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791444444444">
The concept has been applied on Georgian, Polish
and Bella Coola - languages with highly complex
clusters of consonants (Cho and King, 2008) and
even on French (F´ery, 2003) to split complex co-
das. In Aromanian, for both “Nadir” and the “De-
scending” sequences, the semisyllable are word-
initial. These semisyllables contain only the onset
from one of the following phonemes: f, v, m, n, s,
f or z.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995683055555555">
Studying the phonotactics of a language can be
valuable for rule based automatic syllabification
(Clements, 1990). Previous studies on phonolog-
ically complex languages like Imdlawn Tashlhiyt
Berber (Frampton, 2011) validated the universal-
ity of this approach. The work of Iacoponi and
Savy (2011) addresses the same problem on Ital-
ian, their rule-based phonetic algorithm reaching
a precision of over 98%. Not any phonetic al-
gorithm can be generalized or applied to different
languages but in all the cases the same pattern is
preserved: the syllable boundary is defined by a
point of low sonority in a sequence of phonemes,
see Figure 2.
In our particular case, based on the previous
analysis of the sonority patterns, we have devised
the following seven rules for establishing a sylla-
ble boundary:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.963543192307692">
1. diphthongs [e“a] and [o“a] are treated as single
units (Chitoran, 2001)
2. maximal onset principle: \ |c+ / - if the
phoneme c is a sonority minimum then the
syllable boundary is placed before the mini-
mum and c is added to the next onset (Kahn,
1976)
3. word-medial c+nasal split: \ +c |/ - if the
consonant c is a sonority minimum and it is
followed by a nasal consonant (i.e. [n], [m]
or [ñ]) then the syllable boundary is placed
after the minimum and c is added to the cur-
rent syllable’s coda - based on the results in
Section 4.5
4. special [s] + stop cluster - the fricative con-
sonant [s] will be treated as having the same
sonority as any other stop consonants ([p], [b]
etc.)
5. split plateau: )  |) - if a sonority plateau
is found then put a syllable boundary in be-
tween
6. initial semisyllables consisting from conso-
nants will be glued to the immediately next
syllable
7. word-final coda can end in one or two glides
- as described in Section 4.4
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956125">
The second and the third rules are the ones re-
ferring to the actual minimum points of sonority
within a word. The key is whether we want to cut
the syllable before or after the minimum point and
this fact is determined by phonotactic constraints.
The initial semisyllables, although they respect the
SSP, are merged within the next syllable and the
word final codas may end in glides.
We have compared the output of this algo-
rithm with the actual data already in our dictio-
nary. Almost one percent of the words were in-
correctly syllabified because they were exceptions
to the above rules and the overall precision was
99%. This algorithm can easily be extended to
other Eastern Romance languages by verifying the
seven rules provided.

6 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999800875">
In this paper we have offered a quantitative ap-
proach to the syllable structures and substructures
found in Aromanian. In addition, we propose a
dictionary resource to inspire future studies and to
help preserve a “definitely endangered” Romance
language. It is not an easy task to execute a study
on a language that lacks an institutionalized stan-
dard. Our approach is empirical, corpus based and
the quality of the results is strictly dependent on
the quality of the corpus. This is why we have fo-
cused on investigating general phonological prop-
erties of the language in the limits afforded by the
corpus at our disposal. Comparisons with existing
studies on Romanian reaffirm the tight relation be-
tween the two languages and offer confidence that
the results obtained are in accordance with exist-
ing facts about them. Moreover, based on phono-
tactic investigations, we have constructed an algo-
rithm for automatic syllabification in Aromanian
that has a 99% accuracy.
Future studies involve developing this resource
to disambiguate the letter “˜a” and adding more de-
tail in the phonetic representation by recording na-
tive speakers. The current phonological study will
help us to further develop rule-based resources on
morphology considering existing theoretical stud-
ies (Caragiu-Marioieanu, 1968) and may help us
to better understand the evolution of the East-
ern Romance languages and the relations between
them. Last but not least, we hope that developing
these linguistic and computational resources will
encourage a widespread use of Aromanian.

<abstract confidence="0.999435043478261">In this paper we have investigated the syllabic structures found in Aromanian a Romance language spoken in the Balkans across multiple countries with important communities which spread from Greece to Romania. We have created a dictionary of syllabified words and analyzed a few general quantitative and phonological aspects of the dictionary. Furthermore, we have approached the syllabic complexities, the sonority patterns present in the syllable’s constituents and the degree in which the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) holds for this language. Based on all the information gathered we have devised an automatic syllabification algorithm which has a 99% accuracy on the words in the dictionary. In this way we hope to extend the existing phonological studies on Eastern Romance and to spread and preserve meta-linguistic information on this endangered language.</abstract>

A representation of this concept can be visualized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The sonority wave The sonority of a phoneme can be regarded as “its loudness relative to that of other sounds with the same length, stress, and pitch” (Ladefoged, 1975). The sonority is given by a concept called strength (Escure, 1977), on one side strength can be represented by the sonorance in which the phonemes are ordered by their acoustic energy: Stops → Fricatives → Nasals → Liquids → Glides → Vowels. On the other side, the scale can be represented by the articulatory resistance (Anderson and Ewen, 1987) of the phonemes as in Figure 3. Figure 3: Scale of articulatory resistance The Sonority Sequence Principle states that the syllable’s peak is a group of segments of high 113 sonority while the syllable’s boundaries consists of phonemes of low sonority. In almost every natural language there are exceptions to this principle and investigating it can be valuable in speech recognition and in automatic syllabification based on phonotactic rules (Frampton, 2011). If the exceptions are accounted then the number of sonority peaks in a word is correlated with the number of syllables. In the same manne</context>

We underline this characteristic because some of the linguistic properties that are present in Aromanian are also present, more or less, in the other three languages largely due to the common historical and linguistic context in which they formed and evolved. Unfortunately, Istro-Romanian and Megleno-Romanian are labeled by the UNESCO Red Book (2010) as “severely endangered” languages with approximately 300 (Filipi, 2002) and respectively 5000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002). Aromanian is not in a better situation carrying the label of “definitely endangered” with approximately 500,000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002). Currently, the language has no accepted standard, being written in various forms depending on social and political factors of the regions in which it is spoken (Kahl, 2006).

For Romanian, a database of syllables was already provided by (Barbu, 2008) under the title “RoSyllabiDict”. This database contains almost all the morphological forms of Romanian words. Among the existing studies with respect to the CV structures in Romanian we count the one of Dinu and Dinu (2006). Comparing two grammatically similar languages in terms of the distribution of CV units can bring a new perspective on the similarities at the phonological level. In CV-theory (Clements and Keyser, 1983) a syllable σ is represented in a three-tier form.

(2006) investigated this law on 33 different languages and found an active correlation between the CV complexity of the syllables and the decay of the ratio between number of syllable and number of phonemes per syllable. In this sense, we have investigated the relation between Romanian and Aromanian with re112 Figure 1: Menzerath-Altmann law. The word/syllable ratio in Romanian and Aromanian spect to the Menzerath-Altmann law. We used the “RoSyllabiDict” dictionary of Romanian syllables compiled by Barbu (2008). This dictionary is constructed from almost all the morphological wordforms in Romanian, having a considerable size of about 520.000 entries. The results can be visualized in Figure 1 - Romanian has a smaller average length of syllables, somewhere close to 4 but a significantly larger average length of words - close to 11. While Aromanian has a slightly larger length of syllables, close to 4.5 but the length of the words does not exceed 7 syllables in average.

One of the main drawbacks of this alphabet is the compression of two different sounds (the mid-central vowel [@] and the closed-central vowel [1]) into the letter “˜a”, leaving the reader to decide which phoneme is actually used. The motivation behind the compression comes from the two vowels being geographical allophones for Aromanian (depending on type F or type A sub-dialect). In this case we should be cautious when analyzing vowels as phonological units. This is not the only case where orthography can influence our study. Aromanian, together with Romanian (Chitoran, 2001), contrasts diphthongs [e“a], [o“a] from semivowel (glide) to vowel sequences [ja] and [wa] (written here as [i“a] and [u“a]). This means that the phonological representation of diphthongs is the one proposed by Chitoran (2002): both elements of the diphthong are represented as sharing a syllable nucleus. According to this representation, diphthongs are predicted to function as a single unit and a single segment. The orthography of our dictionary restricts us to partially operate with these distinctions. Similar to Romanian (Chitoran, 2001), the glide-vowel sequence [u“a] is less frequent - in</context>

In our particular case, based on the previous analysis of the sonority patterns, we have devised the following seven rules for establishing a syllable boundary: 1. diphthongs [e“a] and [o“a] are treated as single units (Chitoran, 2001) 2. maximal onset principle: \ |c+ / - if the phoneme c is a sonority minimum then the syllable boundary is placed before the minimum and c is added to the next onset (Kahn, 1976) 3. word-medial c+nasal split: \ +c |/ - if the consonant c is a sonority minimum and it is followed by a nasal consonant (i.e. [n], [m] or [ñ]) then the syllable boundary is placed after the minimum and c is added to the current syllable’s coda - based on the results in Section 4.5 4. special [s] + stop cluster - the fricative consonant [s] will be treated as having the same sonority as any other stop consonants ([p]</context>

In this case we should be cautious when analyzing vowels as phonological units. This is not the only case where orthography can influence our study. Aromanian, together with Romanian (Chitoran, 2001), contrasts diphthongs [e“a], [o“a] from semivowel (glide) to vowel sequences [ja] and [wa] (written here as [i“a] and [u“a]). This means that the phonological representation of diphthongs is the one proposed by Chitoran (2002): both elements of the diphthong are represented as sharing a syllable nucleus. According to this representation, diphthongs are predicted to function as a single unit and a single segment. The orthography of our dictionary restricts us to partially operate with these distinctions. Similar to Romanian (Chitoran, 2001), the glide-vowel sequence [u“a] is less frequent - in our dictionary with less than 100 occurrences - compared to the larger number of occurrences for the diphthong [o“a]. However, other dictionaries like the one of Caragiu-Marioieanu (1997), which is complete only to the letter </context>

It was noticeable to observed that the SSP is always obeyed by the “Cons” substructure of the coda. 4.5 Sonority and the onset All the results so far, indicate that the coda is not a very complex structure in this language. In fact, Caragiu-Mariot¸eanu (1968) stated that Aromanian previously had open syllables. A fact attested in the early works of the eighteenth century writers (Papahagi, 1909) describing the syllables as being opened. The linguistic study of Davis and Baertsch (2011) offers a model in which the structure of the onset is related to that of the coda through a shared component called margin. The model predicts that a complex onset in a language 114 or u requires the presence of a coda (Kaye and Lowenstamm, 1981). For Aromanian, in particular, the formation of the coda could be a result of the increased complexity of the onsets. We have investigated the different patterns of sonorities found in onsets, Table 4 contains the percentages of each of these patterns. Aromanian has four types of sonority sequences in the onset: • “Constant” −→ - one or more consonan</context>

Phonetically, the spoken chain consists in waves of sonority or sound intensity (Lehmann, 2005). The Sequence Sonority Principle (SSP) (Clements, 1990) regards the syllable as the phonological unit behind the waves of sonority. A representation of this concept can be visualized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The sonority wave The sonority of a phoneme can be regarded as “its loudness relative to that of other sounds with the same length, stress, and pitch” (Ladefoged, 1975). The sonority is given by a concept called strength (Escure, 1977), on one side strength can be represented by the sonorance in which the phonemes are ordered by their acoustic energy: Stops → Fricatives → Nasals → Liquids → Glides → Vowels. On the other side, the scale can be represented by the articulatory resistance (Anderson and Ewen, 1987) of the phonemes as in Figure 3. Figure 3: Scale of articulatory resistance The Sonority Sequence Principle states that the syllable’s peak is a group of segments of high 113 sonority while the syllable’s boundaries consists of phonemes of low sonority.

Which means, in this particular case, that the average size of a word in syllables increases as the average size of the syllable (in phonemes) decreases. Previous studies proved that this law has applicability for more general linguistic constructs, in syntax (Buk, 2007) and even beyond linguistics in genome structures (Baixeries et al., 2013). In the syllable-phoneme context, extensive studies have been made. Fenk et al.

We underline this characteristic because some of the linguistic properties that are present in Aromanian are also present, more or less, in the other three languages largely due to the common historical and linguistic context in which they formed and evolved. Unfortunately, Istro-Romanian and Megleno-Romanian are labeled by the UNESCO Red Book (2010) as “severely endangered” languages with approximately 300 (Filipi, 2002) and respectively 5000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002). Aromanian is not in a better situation carrying the label of “definitely endangered” with approximately 500,000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002). Currently, the language has no accepted standard, being written in various forms depending on social and political factors of the regions in which it is spoken (Kahl, 2006). This is why we believe that a study on Aromanian can only be done empirically, on corpus data or dictionaries or by adopting a multi-valued dialectal approach justified by field work. 2 Previous work Although Capidan (1932) offers an exh</context>

Unfortunately, Istro-Romanian and Megleno-Romanian are labeled by the UNESCO Red Book (2010) as “severely endangered” languages with approximately 300 (Filipi, 2002) and respectively 5000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002). Aromanian is not in a better situation carrying the label of “definitely endangered” with approximately 500,000 speakers (Atanasov, 2002). Currently, the language has no accepted standard, being written in various forms depending on social and political factors of the regions in which it is spoken (Kahl, 2006). This is why we believe that a study on Aromanian can only be done empirically, on corpus data or dictionaries or by adopting a multi-valued dialectal approach justified by field work. 2 Previous work Although Capidan (1932) offers an exhaustive study on Aromanian with valuable comments on previous research, very few modern linguistic studies target this language and there are no computational linguistic studies as far as we are aware at this point. Caragiu-Marioiean (1968) offered one of the first modern studies with respect to the phonology and structural morphology of the language; her wor</context>

In our particular case, based on the previous analysis of the sonority patterns, we have devised the following seven rules for establishing a syllable boundary: 1. diphthongs [e“a] and [o“a] are treated as single units (Chitoran, 2001) 2. maximal onset principle: \ |c+ / - if the phoneme c is a sonority minimum then the syllable boundary is placed before the minimum and c is added to the next onset (Kahn, 1976) 3. word-medial c+nasal split: \ +c |/ - if the consonant c is a sonority minimum and it is followed by a nasal consonant (i.e. [n], [m] or [ñ]) then the syllable boundary is placed after the minimum and c is added to the current syllable’s coda - based on the results in Section 4.5 4. special [s] + stop cluster - the fricative consonant [s] will be treated as having the same sonority as any other stop consonants ([p], [b] etc.) 5. split plateau: ) |) - if a sonority plateau is found then put a syllable boundary in between 6. initial semisyllables consisting from consonants will be glued to th</context>

In fact, Caragiu-Mariot¸eanu (1968) stated that Aromanian previously had open syllables. A fact attested in the early works of the eighteenth century writers (Papahagi, 1909) describing the syllables as being opened. The linguistic study of Davis and Baertsch (2011) offers a model in which the structure of the onset is related to that of the coda through a shared component called margin. The model predicts that a complex onset in a language 114 or u requires the presence of a coda (Kaye and Lowenstamm, 1981). For Aromanian, in particular, the formation of the coda could be a result of the increased complexity of the onsets. We have investigated the different patterns of sonorities found in onsets, Table 4 contains the percentages of each of these patterns. Aromanian has four types of sonority sequences in the onset: • “Constant” −→ - one or more consonants (sonority plateau) with equal sonorities • “Ascending” / - a sequence of phonemes with ascending sonorities • “Descending” \ - a sequence of phonemes with descending sonorities • “Nadir” \/ - a sequence in which the sonority descends and then r</context>

This suggests that Aromanian is slightly more complex in terms of syllable phonotactics than Romanian. 4.3 The structure of the syllable In order to investigate the complexity and diversity of the syllables in Aromanian, we have chosen to examine the constituents of the syllables in terms of sonority sequences. Phonetically, the spoken chain consists in waves of sonority or sound intensity (Lehmann, 2005). The Sequence Sonority Principle (SSP) (Clements, 1990) regards the syllable as the phonological unit behind the waves of sonority. A representation of this concept can be visualized in Figure 2. Figure 2: The sonority wave The sonority of a phoneme can be regarded as “its loudness relative to that of other sounds with the same length, stress, and pitch” (Ladefoged, 1975). The sonority is given by a concept called strength (Escure, 1977), on one side strength can be represented by the sonorance in which the phonemes are ordered by their acoustic energy: Stops → Fricatives → Nasals → Liquids →</context>

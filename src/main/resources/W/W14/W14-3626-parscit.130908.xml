<bodyText confidence="0.999953931034483">
There has been recently a great progress in
the field of automatically generated knowl-
edge bases and corresponding disambigua-
tion systems that are capable of mapping
text mentions onto canonical entities. Ef-
forts like the before mentioned have en-
abled researchers and analysts from vari-
ous disciplines to semantically “understand”
contents. However, most of the approaches
have been specifically designed for the En-
glish language and - in particular - sup-
port for Arabic is still in its infancy. Since
the amount of Arabic Web contents (e.g.
in social media) has been increasing dra-
matically over the last years, we see a
great potential for endeavors that support
an entity-level analytics of these data. To
this end, we have developed a framework
called AIDArabic that extends the existing
AIDA system by additional components
that allow the disambiguation of Arabic
texts based on an automatically generated
knowledge base distilled from Wikipedia.
Even further, we overcome the still exist-
ing sparsity of the Arabic Wikipedia by ex-
ploiting the interwiki links between Arabic
and English contents in Wikipedia, thus,
enriching the entity catalog as well as dis-
ambiguation context.

1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977076923077">
Internet data including news articles and web pages,
contain mentions of named-entities such as people,
places, organizations, etc. While in many cases
the intended meanings of the mentions is obvi-
ous (and unique), in many others, the mentions
are ambiguous and have many different possible
meanings. Therefore, Named-Entity Disambigua-
tion (NED) is essential for many application in the
domain of Information Retrieval (such as informa-
tion extraction). It also enables producing more
useful and accurate analytics. The problem has
been exhaustively studied in the literature. The
essence of all NED techniques is using background
information extracted from various sources (e.g.
Wikipedia), and use such information to know the
correct/intended meaning of the mention.
The Arabic content is enormously growing on
the Internet, nevertheless, background ground in-
formation is clearly lacking behind other languages
such as English. Consider Wikipedia for example,
while the English Wikipedia contains more than 4.5
million articles, the Arabic version contains less
than 0.3 million ones 1. As a result, and up to our
knowledge, there is no serious work that has been
done in the area of performing NED for Arabic
input text.

1.2 Problem statement
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
NED is the problem of mapping ambiguous names
of entities (mentions) to canonical entities regis-
tered in an entity catalog (knowledgebase) such as
Freebase (www.freebase.com), DBpedia (Auer et
al., 2007), or Yago (Hoffart et al., 2013). For ex-
ample, given the text “I like to visit Sheikh Zayed.

Emirates4. In order to automatically establish such
mappings, the machine needs to be aware of the
characteristic description of each entity, and try to
find the most suitable one given the input context.
In our example, knowing that the input text men-
tioned the city of Cairo favors the Egyptian city
over the mosque in Abu Dhabi, for example. In
principle, state-of-the-art NED frameworks require
main four ingredients to solve this problem:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9975306">
• Entity Repository: A predefined universal
catalog of all entities known to the NED
framework. In other words, each mention in
the input text must be mapped to an entity in
the repository, or to null indicating the correct
entity is not included in the repository.
• Name-Entity Dictionary: It is a many-to-
many relation between possible mentions and
the entities in the repository. It connects an
entity with different possible mentions that
might be used to refer to this entity, as well as
connecting a mention with all potential candi-
date entity it might denote.
• Entity-Descriptions: It keeps per entity a
bag of characteristic keywords or keyphrases
that distinguishes an entity from another. In
addition, they come with scoring scheme that
signify the specificity of such keyword to that
entity.
• Entity-Entity Relatedness Model: For co-
herent text, the entities that are used for map-
ping all the mentions in the input text, should
be semantically related. For that reason, an
entity-entity relatedness model is required to
asses the coherence.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999205333333333">
For the English language, all of the ingredi-
ents mentioned above are richly available. For
instance, the English Wikipedia is a comprehen-
sive up-to-date resource. Many NED systems
use Wikipedia as their entity repository. Further-
more, many knowledge bases are extracted from
Wikipedia as well. When trying to apply the exist-
ing NED approaches on the Arabic text, we face
the following challenges:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.993075">
• Entity Repository: There is no such compre-
hensive entity catalog. Arabic Wikipedia is an

order of magnitude smaller than the English
one. In addition, many entities in the Arabic
Wikipedia are specific to the Arabic culture
with no corresponding English counterpart.
As a consequence, even many prominent enti-
ties are missing from the Arabic Wikipedia.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982330285714285">
• Name-Entity Dictionary: Most of the name-
entity dictionary entries originate from man-
ual input (e.g. anchor links). Like outlined
before, Arabic Wikipedia has fewer resources
to extract name-entity mappings, caused by
the lack of entities and lack of manual input.
• Entity-Descriptions: As already mentioned,
there is a scarcity of anchor links in the Arabic
Wikipedia. Further, the categorization system
of entities is insufficient, Both are essential
sources of building the entities descriptions.
Hence, it is more challenging to produce com-
prehensive description of each entity.
• Entity-Entity Relatedness Model: Related-
ness estimation among entities is usually com-
puted using the overlap in the entities descrip-
tion and/or link structure of Wikipedia. Due to
the previously mentioned scarcity of contents
in the Arabic Wikipedia, it is also difficult to
accurately estimate the entity-entity related-
ness.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981">
As a consequence, the main challenge in per-
forming NED on Arabic text is the lack of a com-
prehensive entity catalog together with rich descrip-
tions of each entity. We considered our open source
AIDA system5 (Hoffart et al., 2011)- mentioned as
state-of-the-art NED System by (Ferrucci, 2012) -
as a starting point and modified its data acquisition
pipeline in order to generate a schema suitable for
performing NED on Arabic text.

• Entity-Descriptions: We harnessed different
ingredients in YAGO3, and Wikipedia to pro-
duce a rich entity context schema. For the
sake of precision, we did not employ any au-
tomated translation.

fused the link structure of both the English

NED is one of the classical NLP problems that
is essential for many Information Retrieval tasks.
Hence, it has been extensively addressed in NLP
research. Most of NED approaches use Wikipedia
as their knowledge repository. (Bunescu and Pasca,
2006) defined a similarity measure that compared
the context of a mention to the Wikipedia cate-
gories of the entity candidate. (Cucerzan, 2007;
Milne and Witten, 2008; Nguyen and Cao, 2008)
extended this framework by using richer features
for similarity comparison. (Milne and Witten,
2008) introduced the notion of semantic related-
ness and estimated it using the the co-occurrence
counts in Wikipedia. They used the Wikipedia link
structure as an indication of occurrence. Below,
we give a brief overview on the most recent NED
systems:
The AIDA system is an open source system
that employs contextual features extracted from
Wikipedia (Hoffart et al., 2011; Yosef et al., 2011).
It casts the NED problem into a graph problem
with two types of nodes (mention nodes, and en-
tity nodes). The weights on the edges between the
mentions and the entities are the contextual similar-
ity between mention’s context and entity’s context.
The weights on the edges between the entities are
the semantic relatedness among those entities. In a
subsequent process, the graph is iteratively reduced
to achieve a dense sub-graph where each mention
is connected to exactly one entity.
The CSAW system uses local scores computed
from 12 features extracted from the context sur-
rounding the mention, and the candidate entities
(Kulkarni et al., 2009). In addition, it computes
global scores that captures relatedness among anno-
tations. The NED is then formulated as a quadratic
programming optimization problem, which nega-
tively affects the performance. The software, how-
ever, is not available.
DBpedia Spotlight uses Wikipedia anchors, ti-
tles and redirects to search for mentions in the input
text (Mendes et al., 2011). It casts the context of the
mention and the entity into a vector-space model.
Cosine similarity is then applied to identify the
candidate with the highest similarity. Nevertheless,
their model did not incorporate any semantic relat-
edness among entities. The software is currently
available as a service.
TagMe 2 exploits the Wikipedia link structure to
estimate the relatedness among entities (Ferragina
and Scaiella, 2010). It uses the measure defined by
(Milne and Witten, 2008) and incorporates a voting
scheme to pick the right mapping. According to
the authors, the system is geared for short input
text with limited context. Therefore, the approach
favors coherence among entities over contextual
similarity. TagMe 2 is available a service.
Illinois Wikifier formulates NED as an opti-
mization problem with an objective function de-
signed for higher global coherence among all men-
tions (Ratinov et al., 2011). In contrast to AIDA
and TagMe 2, it does not incorporate the link struc-
ture of Wikipedia to estimate the relatedness among
entities. Instead, it uses normalized Google sim-
ilarity distance (NGD) and pointwise mutual in-
formation. The software is as well available as a
service.
Wikipedia Miner is a machine-learning based
approach (Milne and Witten, 2008). It exploits
three features in order to train the classifier. The
features it employs are prior probability that a men-
tion refers to a specific entity, properties extracted
from the mention context, and finally the entity-
entity relatedness. The software of Wikipedia

The approaches mentioned before have been de-
veloped for English language NED. As such, none
of them is ready to handle Arabic input without
major modification.
As of now, no previous research exploits cross-
lingual resources to enable NED for Arabic text.
Nevertheless, cross-lingual resources have been
used to improve Arabic NER (Darwish, 2013).
They used Arabic and English Wikipedia together
with DBpedia in order to build a large Arabic-
English dictionary for names. This augments the
Arabic names with a capitalization feature, which
is missing in the Arabic language.

In order to build AIDArabic, we have extended the
pipeline used for building an English AIDA schema
from the YAGO knowledge base. The new archi-
tecture is shown in Figure 1 and indicates those
components, that have been added for AIDArabic.
These are pre- and post-processing stages to the
original AIDA schema extractor. The new pipeline

major outputs:

AIDA Schema Building
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966794117647059">
In this stage we invoke the original AIDA schema
builder without any language information. How-
ever, we additionally add the Freebase knowledge
base to AIDA and map Freebase entities to YAGO3
entities. Freebase is used here solely to harness its
coverage of multi-lingual names of different enti-
ties. It is worth noting that Freebase is used merely
to enrich YAGO3, but the set of entities are gath-
ered from YAGO. In other words, if there is an
entity in Freebase without a YAGO counter part, it
gets discarded.
Translation
Although it is generally viable to use machine trans-
lation or “off the shelf” English-Arabic dictionaries
to translate the context of entities. However, we
confine ourselves to the dictionaries extracted from
Wikipedia that maps entities as well as categories
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.987171">

<bodyText confidence="0.96029225">
from English to Arabic. This is done in order to
achieve a high precision derived from the manual
labor inherent in interwiki links and assigned cate-
gories.
Filtration
This is a final cleaning stage. Despite translating
the context of entities using the Wikipedia-based
dictionaries as comprehensive as possible, a con-
siderable amount of context information remains
in English (e.g. those English categories that do
not have an Arabic counterpart). To this end, any
remaining leftovers in English are being discarded.

This section explains the implementation of the
pipeline described in Section 3. We first high-
light the differences between YAGO2 and YAGO3,
which justify the switch of the underlying knowl-
edge base. Then, we present the techniques we

tween mentions and candidate entities. After that,
we explain the context enrichment for Arabic enti-
ties by exploiting cross-lingual evidences. Finally,
we briefly explain the entity-entity relatedness mea-

table (cf. Table 1 for details) we summarize the
terminology used in the following section.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992611">
4.1 Entity Repository
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999982882352941">
YAGO3 has been specifically designed as a multi-
lingual knowledge base. Hence, standard YAGO3
extractors take as an input a set of Wikipedia dumps
from different languages, and produce a unified
repository of named entities across all languages.
This is done by considering inter-wiki links. If an
entity in language l E L − {en} has an English
counter part, the English one is kept instead of
that in language l, otherwise, the original entity
is kept. For example, in our repository, the entity
used to represent Egypt is “Egypt” coming from
the English Wikipedia instead of “ar/Qå”Ó” coming
from the Arabic Wikpedia. However, the entity that
refers to the western part of Cairo is identified as
“ar/SQëA�®Ë@ H. Q «” because it has no counter-part in
the English Wikipedia. Formally, the set of entities
in YAGO3 are defined as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.968635">
E = Een U Ear
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999856714285714">
After the extraction is done, YAGO3 generates
an entity dictionary for each and every language.
This dictionary translates any language specific
entity into the one that is used in YAGO3 (whether
the original one, or the English counter part).
Based on the the previous example, the following
entries are created in the dictionary:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.987084">
ar/Qå”Ó → Egypt
ar/SQëAV H. Q«� → ar/SQëAV H. Q«
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.998697333333333">
Such a dictionary is essential for all further pro-
cessing we do over YAGO3 to enrich the Arabic
knowledge base using the English one. It is worth
noting here, that this dictionary is completely au-
tomatically harvested from the inter-wiki links in
Wikipedia, and hence no automated machine trans-
lation and/or transliteration are invoked (e.g. for
Person Names, Organization Names, etc.). While
this may harm the coverage of our linkage, it guar-
antees the precision of our mapping at the same
time. This is thanks to the high quality of inter-
wiki between named-entities in Wikipedia.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.948454">
4.2 Name-Entity Dictionary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982115615384615">
The dictionary in the context of NED refers to the
relation that connects strings to canonical entities.
In other words, given a mention string, the dictio-
nary provides a list of potential canonical entities
this string may refer to. In our original implemen-
tation of AIDA, this dictionary was compiled from
four sources extracted from Wikipedia (titles, dis-
ambiguation pages, redirects, and anchor texts).
We used the same sources after adapting them to
the Arabic domain, and added to them entries com-
ing from Freebase. In the following, we briefly
summarize the main ingredients used to populate
our dictionary:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983611769230769">
• Titles: The most natural possible name of a
canonical entity is the title of its correspond-
ing page in Wikipedia. This is different from
the entity ID itself. For example, in our exam-
ple for the entity “Egypt” that gets its id from
the English Wikipeida, we consider the title
“Qå”Ó” coming from the Arabic Wikipedia.
• Disambiguation Pages: These pages
are called in the Arabic Wikipedia
“iJ� �“ñ�JË@:)Aj�®“”. They are dedicated
pages to list the different possible meanings
of a specific name. We harness all the links

potential entities for that name. To this end,
we extract our content solely from the Arabic
Wikipedia. For instance, the phrase “ a.K
YÓ
YK�@ �P”has a disambiguation page that lists all
the cities that all called Zayed including the
ones in Egypt, Bahrain and United Arab Emi-
rates.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9431435">
• Redirects: “ uCK�ñm��” denotes redirects in
Arabic Wikipedia. Those are pages where
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.936295285714286">
you search for a name and it redirects you
to the most prominent meaning of this name.
This we extract from the Arabic Wikipedia as
well. For example, if you search in the Arabic
Wikipedia for the string “YK�@�P”, you will be au-
tomatically redirected to page of the president
of the United Arabic Emirates.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7724504375">
• Anchor Text: When people create links
in Wikipedia, sometimes they use different
names from the title of the entity page as an an-
chor text. This indicates that this new name is
also a possible name for that entity. Therefore,
we collect all anchors in the Arabic Wikipedia
and associate them with the appropriate en-
tities. For example, in the Arabic Wikipedia
page of Sheikh Zayed, there is a anchor link
to the city of Al Ain “ar/ �)t�ªË@”, while the an-
chor text reads “aJ�sQå�„Ë@ éa..la&apos;d@” (in English:
“The Eastern Area”). Therefore, when there is
a mention called “The Eastern Area”, one of
the potential candidate meanings is the city of
Al-Ain in United Arab Emirates.
• Freebase: Freebase is a comprehensive re-

source which comes with multi-lingual labels
of different entities. In addition, there is a
one-to-one mapping between (most of) Free-
base entities and YAGO3 entities, because
Freebase is extracted from Wikipedia as well.
Therefore, we carry over the Arabic names
of the entities from Freebase to our AIDA
schema after mapping the entities to their cor-
responding ones in YAGO3.

The context of an entity is the cornerstone in the
data required to perform NED task with high qual-
ity. Having a comprehensive and “clean” context
for each entity facilitates the task of the NED al-
gorithm by providing good clues for the correct
mapping. We follow the same approach that we
used in the original AIDA framework by repre-
senting an entity context as a set of characteristic
keyphrases that captures the specifics of such en-
tity. The keyphrases are further decomposed into
keywords with specificity scores assigned to each
of them in order to estimate the global and entity-
specific prominence of this keyword. The origi-
nal implementation of AIDA extracted keyphrases
from 4 different sources (anchor text, inlink titles,
categories, as well as citation titles and external
links). Below we summarize how we adopted the
extraction to accommodate the disambiguation of
Arabic text.

portant aspects of that page. In the original
implementation of AIDA, all anchors in a
page are associated with the corresponding
entity of this page, and added to the set of
its keyphrases.The same holds for AIDAra-
bic. However, we extract the anchors from the
Arabic Wikipedia to get Arabic context.

are as well. In AIDA, the set of the titles
of the pages that has links to an entity were
considered among the keyphrases of such an
entity. We pursued the same approach here,
and fused incoming links to an entity from
both English and Arabic Wikipedia. Once
set of the incoming links was fully built, we
applied - when applicable - interwiki links
to get the translation of titles of the entities
coming from the English Wikipedia into the
Arabic language. Formally:

<equation confidence="0.728901">

one or more categories, which are mentioned
at the bottom part of the page. We configured
YAGO3 to provide the union of the categories
from both, the English and Arabic Wikipedia.
We exploit the interwiki links among cate-
gories to translate the English categories to
Arabic. This comes with two benefits, we
use the category mappings which result in
fairly accurate translation in contrast to ma-
chine translation. In addition, we enrich the
category system of the Arabic Wikipedia by
categories from the English for entities that
have corresponding English counterpart.

4.4 Entity-Entity Relatedness Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931238095238">
For coherent text, there should be connection be-
tween all entities mentioned in the text. In other
words, a piece of text cannot cover too many as-
pects at the same time. Therefore, recent NED tech-
niques exploit entity-entity relatedness to further
improve the quality of mapping mentions to enti-
ties. The original implementation of AIDA used
for that purpose a measure introduced by (Milne
and Witten, 2008) that estimates the relatedness
or coherence between two entities using the over-
lap in the incoming links to them in the English
Wikipedia.
Despite the cultural difference, it is fairly con-
ceivable to assume that if two entities are related in
the English Wikipedia, they should also be related
in the Arabic one. In addition, we enrich the link
structure used in AIDA with the link structure of
the Arabic Wikipedia. Hence, we estimate the relat-
edness between entities using overlap in incoming
links in both the English and Arabic Wikipedia’s
together.

5.1 Setup and Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999638066666667">
Up to our knowledge, there is no standard Arabic
data set available for a systematic evaluation of
NED. In order to assess the quality of our system,
we manually prepared a small benchmark collec-
tion. To this end, we gathered 10 news articles from
www.aljazeera.net from the domains of sports and
politics including regional as well as international
news. We manually annotated the mentions in the
text, and disambiguated the text by using AIDAra-
bic. In our setup, we used the LOCAL configu-
ration setting of AIDA together with the original
weights. The data set contains a total of 103 men-
tions. AIDArabic managed to annotate 34 of them
correctly, and assigned 68 to NULL, while one
mention was mapped wrongly.

AIDArabic performance in terms of precision is
impressive (%97.1). Performance in that regard is
positively influenced by testing on a “clean” input
of news articles. Nevertheless, AIDArabic loses on
recall. Mentions that are mapped to NULL, either

have no correct entity in the entity repository, or
the entity exists but lacks the corresponding name-
entity dictionary entry.
This observation confirms our initial hypothe-
sis that lack of data is one of the main challenges
for applying NED on Arabic text. Another aspect
that harms recall is the nature of Arabic language.
Letters get attached to the beginning and/or the
end of words (e.g. connected prepositions and pro-
nouns). In such a case, when querying the dictio-
nary, AIDArabic is not able to retrieve the correct
candidates for a mention like “L..�J�a �”, because of
the “u� ” in the beginning. Similar difficulties arise
when matching the entities description. Here, many
keywords do not be to match the input text because
they appear in a modified version augmented with
some extra letters.

6 Conclusion &amp; Outlook
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999703125">
In this paper, we have introduced the AIDArabic
framework, which allows named entity disambigua-
tion of Arabic texts based on an automatically gen-
erated knowledge based derived from Wikipedia.
Our proof-of-concept implementation shows that
entity disambiguation for Arabic texts becomes vi-
able, although the underlying data sources (in par-
ticular Wikipedia) still is relatively sparse. Since
our approach “integrates” knowledge encapsulated
in interwiki links from the English Wikipedia, we
are able to boost the amount of context informa-
tion available compared to a solely monolingual
approach.
As a next step, intend to build up a proper
dataset that we will use for a systematic evalua-
tion of AIDArabic. In addition, we plan to apply
machine translation/transliteration techniques for
keyphrases and/or dictionary lookup for keywords
in order to provide even more context informa-
tion for each and every entity. In addition, we
may employ approximate matching approaches for
keyphrases to account for the existence of addi-
tional letter connected to words. As a byproduct
we will be able to apply AIDArabic on less formal
text (e.g. social media) which contains a consid-
erable amount of misspellings for example. Apart
from assessing and improving AIDArabic, a natural
next step is to extend the framework by extractors
for other languages, such as French or German.
By doing so, we are going to create a framework,
which will be in its final version fully language
agnostic.

<abstract confidence="0.994597666666666">There has been recently a great progress in the field of automatically generated knowledge bases and corresponding disambiguation systems that are capable of mapping text mentions onto canonical entities. Efforts like the before mentioned have enabled researchers and analysts from various disciplines to semantically “understand” contents. However, most of the approaches have been specifically designed for the English language and in particular support for Arabic is still in its infancy. Since the amount of Arabic Web contents (e.g. in social media) has been increasing dramatically over the last years, we see a great potential for endeavors that support an entity-level analytics of these data. To this end, we have developed a framework called AIDArabic that extends the existing AIDA system by additional components that allow the disambiguation of Arabic texts based on an automatically generated knowledge base distilled from Wikipedia. Even further, we overcome the still existing sparsity of the Arabic Wikipedia by exploiting the interwiki links between Arabic and English contents in Wikipedia, thus, enriching the entity catalog as well as disambiguation context.</abstract>

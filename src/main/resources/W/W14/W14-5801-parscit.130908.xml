Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9996424">
Support verb constructions (SVC), are verb-noun complexes which play a role in many natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, such as Machine Translation (MT). They can be paraphrased
with a full verb, preserving its meaning, improving at the same time the MT raw output. In this
paper, we discuss the creation of linguistic resources namely a set of dictionaries and rules that
can identify and paraphrase Italian SVCs. We propose a paraphrasing computational method that
is based on open-source tools and data such as NooJ linguistic environment and OpenLogos MT
system. We focus on pre-processing the data that will be machine translated, but our methodology
can also be applied in other fields in NLP. Our results show that linguistic knowledge constitutes
a 95.5% precision rate in identifying SVC and an 88.8% precision rate in paraphrasing SVCs
into full verbs.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999550666666667">
NLP systems, particularly statistical MT (Brown et al., 1993) need very large corpora in order to pro-
duce high quality results. In less-resourced language pairs, many words may occur infrequently, so the
estimation of the word alignments can be inaccurate. Furthermore, multiword expressions are still a hot
potato area for an MT system either statistical or rule-based (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).
A possible technique to resolve all those problems is to generate paraphrases. Paraphrases are alterna-
tive ways of expressing the same information within one or more languages (Callison-burch, 2007). The
benefits of paraphrasing are multiple: the unknown words will be reduced, the MT output will be better
understandable, the accuracy of the meaning will be the same etc.
In MT, paraphrases help to create a more fluent translation and are valuable in the evaluation of MT
results (Zhou et al., 2006). Additionally, paraphrases encourage the end user to understand better the
main idea of a given text and improve the linguistic level of the text in general, because it is better to
express an idea using a full verb than a support verb that has no meaning and a noun.
In this paper, we focus our discussion on paraphrasing Italian SVCs and we propose a computational
model for producing monolingual paraphrases. The sentence (1) is an example of a SVC, while the
sentence (2) is its paraphrase. The sentence (1) consists of a support verb (fare) “make” and a noun
(viaggio) “trip” that is the head of the sentence. In sentence (2) we observe that the SVC is replaced by a
verb, which is the verbal form of the noun. Hence, the SVC of the sentence (1) semantically corresponds
to the full verb of the sentence (2).

other hand, it is not as simple as it may seem, taking into account many both decisions depend on the
features of both the support verb and the nominalised verb.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 represents the past related work on paraphrasing. Section
3 describes the theoretical background on SVC and Section 4 the linguistic resources and tools used
for creating the module. In Section 5, we state our method, explaining step-by-step how the SVC are
identified and paraphrased, as well as the obtained results in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes and

In literature, there are many published studies about paraphrasing SVCs. Research methods range from
manual linguistic and lexicographic work to automatic NLP-oriented studies. Related work on para-
phrasing includes MT, Question Answering, Information Extraction and Text Mining, Summarisation
etc.
On the automatic side Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) use statistical methods in order to acquire
paraphrases that will improve the MT output. They use bilingual corpora for extracting the monolingual
paraphrases by pivoting through phrases among the two languages. According to their method, if the
X is an English phrase and Y its Italian paraphrase and T another possible paraphrase of Y, then, T is
equal to X, so it is the paraphrase of X. Other studies (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003)
have used monolingual parallel corpora, such as translations of classic novels in order to automatically
generate the paraphrases.
Dictionary and ruled-based paraphrasing is less popular because it requires linguistic knowledge and
time. However, Bareiro and Cabral (2009) present ReEscreve, a system that generates monolingual (in
Portuguese) paraphrases using resources from OpenLogos MT system. Even if OpenLogos is an old
MT system its lexical resources, grammatical rules and syntactic-semantic ontology (SAL) (Scott and
Barreiro, 2009) can be applied in many fields in NLP. Other dictionary approaches that can be also
used for paraphrasing are WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998; Green et al., 2001) and NOMLEX (Macleod et al.,
1997).

3 Support verb constructions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999625625">
SVCs are predicate noun complexes where the main verb has not a strong value (Gross, 1975). SVCs
occur in many languages, such as Italian. For instance, in the Italian phrase fare un viaggio the verb fare
is semantically reduced. In Italian, SVC include verbs like dare “give”, avere “have”, prendere “take”,
essere “be” etc.
A semantically weak verb is called support verb (Vsup) (Gross, 1975) or light verb (Polenz, 1963).
One of its characteristics is that the predicative noun (Npred) is realised as head of a noun phrase. Iden-
tifying a SVC is not an easy task and several factors should be taken into consideration. Firstly, they
are not frozen expressions because they can be syntactically splitted by a determiner, an adjective or an
adverb. For example, fare un lungo viaggio “make a long trip”. Secondly, there are constructions with
the same structure but they are fake (pseudo SVCs). For example, fare una banca “make a bank” looks
like a SVC but in that case fare’s semantic is not reduced.
Given that the meaning of the SVCs is mainly reflected by the nominal predicate, we paraphrase them
by replacing the Vsup with a related full verb generated from the predicate noun. For instance, the phrase
faccio una telefonata a Maria “make a call to Maria” can be simply paraphrased as telefono a Maria “I
call Maria”. The idea behind this methodology is to pre-process a text that will then be translated by a
MT Engine so a better MT output will be archived.

resources, such as the electronic dictionary, the rules and the SAL which is embedded in the dictionaries,
are valuable (Barreiro et al., 2011).
In our work we use only the electronic dictionaries including the SAL, in order to implement a module

As mentioned above, our goal is to implement linguistic resources, tools and methodologies that can be
used in automatic processing of SVC and in exporting paraphrases. In this paper, we are presenting only
SVCs that consist of the Vsup fare.
The main linguistic tool for recognising and paraphrasing SVCs is NooJ (Silberztein, 2003). NooJ is
a freeware, linguistic-engineering development environment implemented for formalising various types
of textual phenomena such as orthography, lexical and productive morphology, local, structural and
transformational syntax. It contains several modules that include large coverage lexical resources such
as dictionaries for specific purposes and local grammars that are represented by finite-state transducers
for many different languages. Its electronic dictionaries contain the lemmas with a set of information,
such as:
lemma,(1)+(2)+(3)+... (4)+...
where (1) corresponds to the category/part-of-speech (e.g. “Ver”), (2) to one or more inflectional and/or
derivational paradigms (e.g. how to conjugate verbs, how to nominalise them etc.), (3) to one or more
syntactic properties (e.g. “+transitive” or “+PREPin”) and finally, (4) to one or more semantic properties
(e.g. distributional classes such as “+Human”, domain classes such as “+Politics”).
Our module consists of specific local grammars and electronic dictionaries in order to recognise para-
phrase and translate SVCs, such as fare una presentazione “make a presentation” → presentare “present”.
In order to process SVCs, we first converted the OpenLogos dictionary into NooJ format. Each lemma
is associated with the category, the inflectional paradigm, the equivalent in English and attributes from
SAL ontology. There are also some lemmas containing the Greek equivalent that will help for further
research.
Figure 1 illustrates a sample of the electronic dictionariy that consists of 75509 entries. 20501 of
them are nouns (2335 of them are proper names and toponyms), 10910 are verbs, 22193 are adjectives,
4621 are adverbs, 151 are conjunctions, 5 are determinatives, 295 are prepositions and 118 are pronouns.
14380 over 75509 lemmas are multiword expressions.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.998114">
Figure 1: NooJ electronic dictionary entries.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.996155555555556">
Additionally, for the verbs that can be nominalised we created manually its derivational paradigm
and the Greek equivalent. Applying a derivational paradigm to a given word is possible to change its
syntactic category but not its semantic value. In total, 78 derivational paradigms were created for 289
verbs. For instance, the affix –zione changes the verb presentare into the noun presentazione and the
affix –ata change the verb telefonare to the noun telefonata. This is extremely important, in order to
generate the paraphrases. Figure 2 illustrates dictionary verb and noun entries that are linked to SVC
with the support verb fare.
Moreover, it was needed to create from scratch inflectional grammars and other syntactic grammars in
NooJ format in order to disambiguate the Italian language.

5.1 Identification of SVCs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.913799166666667">
To identify and extract paraphrases for SVCs, we updated OpenLogos dictionaries with morfo-syntactic-
semantic information and with derivational and distributional properties as well. This was necessary due
to new words that were added in the Italian vocabulary in the last years. We have also created local
grammars that are combined with the electronic dictionaries.
We firstly focused on identifying the SVC and updating the existing dictionaries. We obtained that by
designing a simple local grammar, that recognises and annotates SVCs and their predicate nouns (see
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.934417333333333">
Figure 3). The grammar checks for a verb fare followed optionally by a determiner &lt;DET&gt;, adjective
&lt;A&gt; or adverb &lt;ADV&gt; and a noun &lt;N&gt;, and annotates it as a SVC (&lt;SVC=+Pred=$N &gt;).

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9963115">
We applied that grammar to the Italian monolingual Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) in order to extract
the lemmas of the predicate noun ($N ). Then, we updated manually the electronic dictionary by adding
the new predicate nouns. We also associated every new predicate to a corresponding lexical full verb and
every verb with a derivational paradigm (see Figure 4).

After updating the electronic dictionaries, more monolingual paraphrases can be obtained easily. Figure

paraphrases. The grammar checks for the verb fare in present indicative tense followed by a &lt;DET&gt;, an
&lt;A&gt; or an &lt;ADV&gt; and a noun, and generates the verbal paraphrases in the same tense. Furthermore,
we restrict our research to Vsup fare but the same methodology can be apply to other SVCs. The

&lt;$V=:fare+PR+1+s&gt;, and $N PR+1+s represent lexical constraints that are displayed in the output,
such as specification of the support verb that belongs to a specific SVC. The predicate noun is identified,
mapped to its deriver and displayed as a full verb while the other elements of the phrase are eliminated.
Figure 6 shows a NooJ concordance were Italian SVCs are identified and paraphrased as full verbs.

6 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999181875">
We performed a manual evaluation by judging the precision and the recall of 100 phrases that include
the fare. We should notice that only 95 of them were containing SVCs while the other 5 contain the verb
fare followed by a non predicate noun, hence they cannot be paraphrased. This test set was extracted
radomly from the Italian OpenSubtitles corpus (Tiedemann, 2004). Table 1 details the evaluation results
of recognition and paraphrasing of SVCs. We calculated the results for recognising and paraphrasing
given that a recognised SVC is not always paraphrased correctly. We observe that our module can
recognise 86 over 90 SVC that means a precision rate of 95.5%. Regarding recall, 86 over 95 SVCs were
recognised so, an 90.5% rate was obtained. On the other hand, a precision rate of 88.8% (80/90) and a
recall rate of 84.2% (80/95) were obtained for the generated paraphrases. The F-measure for recognising
is 92.93 while for paraphrashing is 86.43.
According to Bareiro and Cabral (2009), MT performs better when translating full verbs over SVCs.
We translated in Google Translate1 the same test set both with SVC and its paraphrases and then we
calculated the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) having as reference the English version (with a single
reference translation). Even if the test set is small for an automatic evaluation, results show an improve-
ment of 0.6 BLEU points when we pre-process the data paraphrasing. In more detail, the obtained BLEU
score for the original test set is 42.76 while for the paraphrased is 43.36.

the low recall scores could be higher upon the improvement of the electronic dictionaries and local

7 Conclusions and Outlook
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999595">
In this paper, we present a SVC-based paraphrasing framework that uses existing tools and technologies
and hand crafted additions for purposes of increasing translation accuracy. Our methodology archived a
precision of 95.5% and a recall of 90.5% in identifying and a precision of 88.8% and a recall of 84.2% in
paraphrasing. We also applied our method in a freely available MT system and results show a significant
improvement.
To make our paraphrasing methodology more accurate, further analysis and work on electronic dictio-
naries is needed. Especially, we need to work on the pseudo fare SVCs. Furthermore, our work should
focus on paraphrasing SVC with full verb that is not associated to the predicate noun such as fare una
sigaretta “make a cigarette” → fumare “smoke”. Last but not least, the graphs should be extended in
order to not discard the adverbs and adjectives that are included in the SVCs. In that case, the MT quality
will be more accurate.
In future research, we are also willing to extend the local grammars and dictionaries in order to gen-
erate bilingual paraphrases in other languages such as Greek and English. For instance, fare una presen-
tazione → to present in English or fare una presentazione → 7rαpovutα(w in Greek.

In this paper, we are presenting only SVCs that consist of the Vsup fare. The main linguistic tool for recognising and paraphrasing SVCs is NooJ (Silberztein, 2003). NooJ is a freeware, linguistic-engineering development environment implemented for formalising var</context>

Regarding recall, 86 over 95 SVCs were recognised so, an 90.5% rate was obtained. On the other hand, a precision rate of 88.8% (80/90) and a recall rate of 84.2% (80/95) were obtained for the generated paraphrases. The F-measure for recognising is 92.93 while for paraphrashing is 86.43. According to Bareiro and Cabral (2009), MT performs better when translating full verbs over SVCs. We translated in Google Translate1 the same test set both with SVC and its paraphrases and then we calculated the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) having as reference the English version (with a single reference translation). Even if the test set is small for an automatic evaluation, results show an improvement of 0.6 BLEU points when we pre-process the data paraphrasing. In more detail, the obtained BLEU score for the original test set is 42.76 while for the paraphrased is 43.36.

A possible technique to resolve all those problems is to generate paraphrases. Paraphrases are alternative ways of expressing the same information within one or more languages (Callison-burch, 2007). The benefits of paraphrasing are multiple: the unknown words will be reduced, the MT output will be better understandable, the accuracy of the meaning will be the same etc. In MT, paraphrases help to create a more fluent translation and are valuable in the evaluation of MT results (Zhou et al., 2006). Additionally, paraphrases encourage the end user to understand better the main idea of a given text and improve the linguistic level of the text in general, because it is better to express an idea using a full verb than a support verb that has no meaning and a noun. In this paper, we focus our discussion on paraphrasing Italian SVCs and we propose a computational model for producing monolingual paraphrases. The sentence (1) is an example of a SVC, while the sentence (2) is its paraphrase. The sentence (1) consists of a support verb (fare) “make” and a noun (viaggio) “trip” that is the head o</context>

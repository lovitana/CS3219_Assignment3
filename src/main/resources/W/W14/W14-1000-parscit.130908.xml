The Third Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra) intends to further progress on the
findings from the second HyTra, held at ACL 2013, and first HyTra which was held (together with
the ESIRMT workshop) as a joint 2-day EACL 2012 workshop. The first editions of HyTra brought
together researchers working on diverse aspects of hybrid machine translation. HyTra proceedings
put together high-quality papers experimenting with current topics including statistical approaches
integrating morphological, syntactic, semantic and rule-based information.
Machine Translation (MT) is a highly interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary field since it is approached
from the point of view of human translators, engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians and
linguists. This workshop aims at motivating the cooperation and interaction between them, and to foster
innovative combinations between the two main MT paradigms: statistical and rule-based.
The advantages of statistical MT are fast development cycles, low cost, robustness, superior lexical
selection and relative fluency due to the use of language models. But (pure) statistical MT has also
disadvantages: It needs large amounts of data, which for many language pairs are not available, and are
unlikely to become available in the foreseeable future. This problem is especially relevant for under-
resourced languages. Recent advances in factored morphological models and syntax-based models in
SMT indicate that non-statistical symbolic representations and processing models need to have their
proper place in MT research and development, and more research is needed to understand how to develop
and integrate these non-statistical models most efficiently.
The advantages of rule-based MT are that its rules and representations are geared towards human
understanding and can be more easily checked, corrected and exploited for applications outside of
machine translation such as dictionaries, text understanding and dialog systems. But (pure) rule-based
MT has also severe disadvantages, among them slow development cycles, high cost, a lack of robustness
in the case of incorrect input, and difficulties in making correct choices with respect to ambiguous words,
structures, and transfer equivalents.
The translations of statistical systems are often surprisingly good with respect to phrases and short
distance collocations, but they often fail when selectional preferences need to be based on more distant
words. In contrast, the output of rule-based systems is often surprisingly good if the parser assigns
the correct analysis to a sentence. However, it usually leaves something to be desired if the correct
analysis cannot be computed, or if there is not enough information for selecting the correct target words
when translating ambiguous words and structures. Given the complementarity of statistical and rule-
based MT, it is natural that the boundaries among them have narrowed. The question is what the
combined architecture should look like. In the past few years, in the MT scientific community, the
interest in hybridization and system combination has significantly increased. This is why a large number
of approaches for constructing hybrid MT have already been proposed offering a considerable potential
of improving MT quality and efficiency. There is also great potential in expanding hybrid MT systems
with techniques, tools and processing resources from other areas of NLP, such as Information Extraction,
Information Retrieval, Question Answering, Semantic Web, Automatic Semantic Inferencing. The aim
of the proposed workshop is to bring together and share ideas among researchers developing statistical,
example-based, or rule-based translation systems and who enhance MT systems with elements from the
other approaches. Hereby a focus will be on effectively combining linguistic and data driven approaches
(rule-based and statistical MT).

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9998472">
The aim of this paper is to propose a far-reaching extension of the phraseological component of
a valence dictionary for Polish. The dictionary is the basis of two different parsers of Polish; its
format has been designed so as to maximise the readability of the information it contains and its
re-applicability. We believe that the extension proposed here follows this approach and, hence,
may be an inspiration in the design of valence dictionaries for other languages.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994117647059">
The starting point of the work reported here is Walenty, a valence dictionary for Polish described in
Przepiórkowski et al. 2014 and available from http://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/Walenty (see §1.1).
Walenty contains some valence schemata for verbal idioms; e.g., one of the schemata for xuc ‘forge’ says
that it combines with a nominal subject, a nominal object and a prepositional phrase consisting of the
preposition NA `on&apos; and the accusative singular form of the noun PAMi�c ‘memory’ – this represents the
idiom ktos kuje cos na pamigc ‘somebody rote learns something’, lit. ‘somebody forges something onto
memory’. The current formalism handles various kinds of verbal phraseological constructions (cf. §1.2),
but also has clear limitations. For example, in Polish one may welcome somebody “with arms wide
open”, and the current formalism makes it possible to express the “welcome with arms + modi�er” part,
but not the specifics of the allowed modifier, namely, that it is the adjective meaning “open”, possibly
itself modified by an intensifying adverb (cf. §1.3 for details).
The aim of this paper is to propose a new subformalism of Walenty for describing phraseological
valence schemata (see §2). To the best of our knowledge, Walenty is already rather unique among valence
dictionaries for various languages in paying so much attention to phraseological constructions (among its
other rare or unique features), and at the same time it is practically employed in parsing by two different
parsers of Polish (cf. §1.1). We believe that these traits make the current proposal to further extend the
underlying formalism potentially interesting to the wider audience.

1.1 Walenty

<bodyText confidence="0.998080636363636">
Walenty is a valence dictionary which is meant to be both human- and machine-readable; in particular,
it is being employed by two parsers of Polish, Świgra (an implementation of a Definite Clause Grammar
description of fragments of Polish syntax; Wolinski 2004) and POLFIE (an implementation of a Lexical
Functional Grammar description of fragments of Polish; Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2012). As these
parsers are based on two rather different linguistic approaches, the valence dictionary must be sufficiently
expressive to accommodate for the needs of both – and perhaps other to come.
Each verb is assigned a number of valence schemata1 and each schema is a set of argument specifica-
tions. Walenty is explicit about what counts as an argument: if two morphosyntactically different phrases
may occur coordinated in an argument position, they are taken to be different realisations of the same
argument. This is exemplified in the following schema for TLuMA=c ‘explain’, as in Musiatem im t�u-
maczyc najprostsze zasady i dlaczego trzeba je stosowac `I had to explain them the most basic principles

and why they should be adhered to&apos; involving a coordinated phrase in the object position consisting of
an NP (najprostsze zasady ‘the most basic principles’) and an interrogative clause (dlaczego trzeba je
stosowac ‘why they should be adhered to&apos;; marked here as cp(int)).

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994465">
There are three argument positions (separated by +) given in this schema: a subject, an object and an
additional argument whose grammatical function is not specified but whose morphosyntactic realisation
is described as a dative nominal phrase (np(dat)). The subject is also described as a nominal phrase
(NP), but its case is specified as structural, i.e., potentially depending on the syntactic context. In Polish,
such subjects are normally nominative, but – according to some approaches – they bear the accusative
case when they are realised as numeral phrases of certain type. Similarly, the nominal realisation of the
object is specified as structural, as it normally occurs in the accusative, unless it is in the scope of verbal
negation, in which case it bears the genitive. Crucially, though, the object is specified here not just as an
NP, but also alternatively as an interrogative (int) clausal argument (cp, for complementiser phrase). A
parser may take this information into account and properly analyse a sentence with unlike coordination
like the one involving TLuMACZYC ‘explain’, given in the previous paragraph.
Other features of the formalism of Walenty worth mentioning here, and described in more detail in
Przepiórkowski et al. 2014, are: the representation of control and raising (cf. Landau 2013 and references
therein), specification of semantically defined arguments (e.g., locative, temporal and manner), with their
possible morphosyntactic realisations defined externally (once for the whole dictionary), handling of
various kinds of pronominal arguments, and other types of non-morphological case specifications (apart
from the structural case). While there is no explicit semantic information in the dictionary at the moment
(apart from such semantically defined arguments and control information), i.e., no subdivision of verbal
lemmata into senses and no semantic role information, Walenty is currently being extended to include
such a semantic layer.

1.2 Phraseology in Walenty
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989714714285714">
Two features of the Walenty formalism deal with multi-word expresssions. The simpler one is concerned
with complex prepositions such as w KwESTII `in (some) matter’, NA TEMAT `on (some) topic’, Z Powonu
‘because of� (lit. `of reason’), etc. Unlike in case of usual prepositional phrases, parameterised with the
preposition lemma and the grammatical case it governs (e.g., prepnp(z,inst) for a prepositional
phrase headed by Z ‘with’ and taking an instrumental NP), such complex prepositions seem to uniformly
govern the genitive case, so explicit case information is not needed here. The following schema, for
RoZPACZAC (z powodu czegos) ‘lament (because of something)’, illustrates this type of arguments:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.783763">
subj{np(str)} + {comprepnp(z powodu)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9992725">
Other, more clearly idiomatic arguments are currently specified as fixed, lexnp and preplexnp.
Phrases of type fixed again have just one parameter: the exact orthographic realisation of the phrase;
see the following schema for ZBIC ‘beat’ (as in He beat them to a pulp), with na kwasne jablko meaning
literally ‘into sour apple’:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.963598">
subj{np(str)} + obj{np(str)} + {fixed(Ina kwa±ne jabªkoI)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909">
A more interesting type is lexnp with four parameters indicating the case of the NP, its grammatical
number, the lemma of the head, and the modifiability pattern. The following schema for PLYNAc `flow&apos;
(as in Hot blood flows in his veins), where the subject is a structurally-cased NP, as usual, but necessarily
headed by KREw ‘blood’ in the singular, and the NP may contain modifiers (cf. atr), illustrates this:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.719126">
subj{lexnp(str,sg,&apos;krew&apos;,atr)} + {preplexnp(w,loc,pl,&apos;»yªa&apos;,ratr)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99964225">
The final lexical argument type is preplexnp, which contains an additional (initial) parameter,
namely the preposition. In the above schema, the second argument is a PP headed by the preposition
w `in&apos; combining with a locative NP in the plural. The NP must be headed by zYLA ‘vein’ and must
contain a possessive modifier (ratr stands for ‘required attribute’). So this schema covers examples
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996897">
84
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999606857142857">
such as Gorqca krew plynie w jego zylach ‘Hot blood flows in his veins’, but – correctly – not the non-
phraseological Gorqca krew plynie w zylach (no modifier of ‘veins’) or Gorqca krew plynie w jego tyle
(singular ‘vein’).
The third possible value of the modifiability parameter is natr, for lexicalised arguments that cannot
involve modification. The following schema for ZMARZNA,C ‘get cold, freeze’ handles the idiom zmarznqc
na kosc ‘freeze to the marrow’ (lit. ‘freeze to (the) bone’); note that kosc ‘bone’ cannot be modified here,
as illustrated by the infelicitous Zmarzl na golq/twardq kosc `(He) froze to (the) naked/hard bone’:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.889865">
subj{np(str)} + {preplexnp(na,acc,sg,&apos;ko±¢&apos;,natr)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997165">
Finally, batr (‘bound attribute’), indicates that the NP must involve a possessive modifier meaning
‘self’ or ‘(one’s) own&apos;, i.e., a form of either Swor or wLASNY. For example, ZosACZYC `see&apos; is involved in
an idiom meaning `to see with one’s own eyes’, as in Na wlasne oczy zobaczylem jej usmiech i to, ze nie
byla wcale taka stara ‘With my own eyes I saw her smile and that she wasn’t so old at all&apos;:2
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.777283">
subj{np(str)} + {np(str); ncp(str,»e)} +
{preplexnp(na,acc,pl,&apos;oko&apos;,batr)}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988675">
We will see below that a more expressive – and more general – scheme for the representation of phrase-
ological valence is needed.
</bodyText>

1.3 Limitations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967419354839">
A number of problems were identified with the formalism of Walenty as it was described in
Przepiórkowski et al. 2014 and summarised above. To start with the simplest cases, it is a simplification to
say that complex prepositions (comprepnp above) are internally unanalysable and always combine with
genitive NPs. For example, while z powodu ‘because ofccannot occur without any additional dependents,
it is sufficient for the nominal form powodu ‘reason’ to be modified by an appropriate adjectival form for
the whole expression to be complete, e.g., z tego powodu ‘because of this’, lit. `of this reason’, z waznego
powodu lit. `of important reason’, etc. This is not a general feature of such complex prepositions, though.
For example, w trakcie ‘during’, lit. `in (the) course’, must combine with a genitive NP and the nominal
form trakcie ‘course’ cannot be modified by an adjective (*w tym trakcie lit. `in this course’).
Second, it is useful for parsers to have more grammatical information about lexically fixed arguments;
for example, fixed(&apos;na kwa±ne jabªko&apos;) clearly has the internal structure of a prepositional
phrase.
Third, the current formalism allows for only two types of phraseological phrases to be specified in
more detail: nominal (lexnp) and prepositional (preplexnp). While not so frequent, other kinds
of idiomatic arguments also occur, including adjectival, adverbial and infinitival. For example, one of
the idiomatic uses of MIEC ‘have’ is miec przechlapane `be in the doghouse, be in deep shit’, lit. ‘have
(it) screwed’, with an appropriate form of the adjective PRZECHLAPANY ‘screwed’. Similarly, the verb
DYSZEC ‘pant’ may be argued to optionally require the adverb LEDwo ‘barely’, as in ledwo dyszec ‘hardly
breathe’. Also, KLASC SIFY ‘lie down’ typically occurs with the infinitival form of SPAC ‘sleep’. The current
formalism may describe such requirements only using the rather inflexible fixed notation.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, modification possibilities within phraseological ar-
guments are far richer than the four symbols atr, natr, ratr and batr could repre-
sent. One case in point is the idiom already mentioned in §1, namely, witac kogos z ot-
wartymi ramionami ‘welcome somebody with open arms’. The best representation of the id-
iomatic argument realisation z otwartymi ramionami ‘with open arms’ is either fixed(&apos;z
otwartymi ramionami&apos;) or preplexnp(z,inst,pl,&apos;rami¦&apos;,atr) or perhaps
preplexnp(z,inst,pl,&apos;rami¦&apos;,ratr). The first of these does not allow for any modi-
fication, so it does not cover z szeroko otwartymi ramionami ‘with wide open arms’, etc. The second
mentions the possibility of modifiers of ramionami (which is the instrumental plural form of the noun
RAMIFY `arm&apos;), but does not constrain this possibility to (a class of) agreeing adjectives, so it would also
cover the non-phraseological z otwartymi ramionami Tomka ‘with Tomek&apos;s open arms’, lit. ‘with open

arms Tomek.GEN&apos;. Also, it makes such modification optional, while witac kogos z ramionami ‘welcome
somebody with arms’ is at best non-phraseological. Finally, the third possibility makes modification
obligatory, but the current meaning of ratr is (for good reasons) constrained to possessive modifiers,
so it again does not cover the case at hand, where adjectival modification is present.

2 Extended phraseological valence
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981">
One more objection against the current subformalism for phraseological arguments, apart from those
adduced in the preceding subsection, is that it contains some ad hoc notation, whose meaning is not
transparent. The best examples of this are ratr (a possessive modifier, not just any modifier) and batr
(the modifier is a form of Sw61 ‘self’s’ or wLASNY `own&apos;). In contrast, we propose a formalism which is
not only more expressive, so as to deal with the limitations mentioned in §1.3, but also more transparent.
As we will see below, the price to pay for this more expressive and principled formalism is that some
argument specifications become more complex.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997953">
2.1 Categories of phraseological arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986444444444">
The first proposed generalisation is to replace category-specific symbols lexnp and preplexnp
with the single lex, whose first parameter indicates the category of the phraseological argu-
ment. For example, the lexnp(str,sg,&apos;krew&apos;,atr) specification given above could be re-
placed by lex(np(str),sg,&apos;krew&apos;,atr), and preplexnp(w,loc,pl,&apos;»yªa&apos;,ratr) –
by lex(prepnp(w,loc),pl,&apos;»yªa&apos;,ratr). Note that the first parameter of lex expresses
more than just the grammatical category of the argument – it is the same specification of the morphosyn-
tactic realisation – here, np(str) and prepnp(w,loc) – as used for non-phraseological arguments.
Any (non-lexical, i.e., not lex, etc.) morphosyntactic specification used in Walenty could be used here,
including also adjectival, adverbial and infinitival.
For example, for miec przechlapane `be in the doghouse, be in deep shit’ mentioned above, where
the adjective PRZECHLAPANY must occur in the singular neuter accusative and may be modified by an
intensifying adverb (mie� kompletnie przechlapane lit. ‘have (it) completely screwed’), the appropriate
argument realisation could be described as: lex(adjp(acc),n,sg,&apos;przechlapanyI,atr).
Similarly, the adverb ledwo ‘barely’ combining with forms of DYSZEC ‘pant’ could be described
as lex(advp(misc),&apos;ledwo&apos;,natr) (recycling the existing morphosyntactic specification
advp(misc) for true adverbial phrases), and the infinitival form of SPAC ‘sleep’ co-occurring with
KLASC Sid ‘lie down’ – as lex(infp(imperf),&apos;spa¢&apos;,natr) (again, reusing the standard nota-
tion for imperfective infinitival phrases, infp(imperf)).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999256">
2.2 Modification patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990885785714286">
The most profound generalisation concerns, however, the specification of modification patterns within
idiomatic arguments. We propose to retain three basic indicators, namely, natr (no modification possi-
ble), atr (modification possible) and ratr (modification required), but – in the case of the last two –
additional information must be given specifying the kind of modification that is allowed or required. Ad-
ditionally, atr1 and ratr1 are envisaged as variants of atr and ratr with the additional constraint
that at most one such modifier may be present.3
For example, instead of preplexnp(z,inst,pl,&apos;rami¦&apos;,ratr) for z otwartymi ramionami
‘with open arms’, the following argument specification could be given, explicitly mentioning that the only
possible modifier of ramionami ‘arms’ is an adjectival phrase (and not, say, a genitive modifier):4
{lex(prepnp(z,inst),pl,&apos;rami¦&apos;,ratr({adjp(agr)}))}
Note that morphosyntactic specifications of possible or required modifiers are enclosed in curly brack-
ets, just as in case of direct arguments of verbs, and for the same reason: sometimes multiple morphosyn-
tactic realisations are possible and may be coordinated, which indicates that they occupy the same syntac-
tic position. An example of this is the expression komus cierpnie skóra na mysl o czyms ‘something makes
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.999705">
3In case of ratr, the obligatoriness of modifier together with this constraint mean that exactly one modifier must occur.
4The symbol agr indicates agreeing case here.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.996988">
86
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.97719195">
somebody’s flesh creep’, lit. `somebody.nAT creeps skin.NOM on (the) thought.Acc about something.LOc&apos;.
The argument na mysl o czyms `on (the) thought of something’ may be realised in at least three ways: as a
prepositional phrase as here (prepnp(o,loc)), as a finite clause introduced by the complementiser zE
‘that’ (cp(»e); e.g., komus cierpnie skóra na mysl, ze (to sig stalo) lit. `somebody.nAT creeps skin.NOM
on (the) thought.Acc that (this happened.REFL)&apos;), or as a so-called correlative phrase which shares features
of the first two realisations, e.g., na mysl o tym, ie (to sig stalo) lit. `on (the) thought about this.LOc that
(this happened.REFL)&apos; (prepncp(o,loc,»e)). Such a disjunctively specified modification possibility
may be expressed as follows (with the line broken for typographic reasons and indented for readability):
{lex(prepnp(na,acc),sg,&apos;my±l&apos;,
ratr({prepnp(o,loc);cp(»e);prepncp(o,loc,»e)}))}
This specification is still incomplete: the noun mysl may also be modified by an adjectival form, e.g.,
the adjectival pronoun tg, as in skóra mi cierpnie na tg mysl ‘this thought makes my flesh creep’, lit.
`skin.NOM me.nAT creeps on this.Acc thought.Acc&apos;. This means that adjp(agr) must be added as a
possible modifier type. But the status of this modifier type is different than the three modifier types
given above: no two of these three phrases can co-occur unless they are coordinated, but any of them
can co-occur (and cannot be coordinated) with adjp(agr), e.g., skóra mi cierpnie na samg mysl o tym
‘the sheer thought makes my flesh creep’, lit. `skin.NOM me.nAT creeps on sheer.Acc thought.Acc about
this.LOc&apos;. Hence, the two kinds of modification possibilities are analogous to two different arguments
(here, actually, dependents) of a predicate occupying different syntactic positions, and the same notation
could be used to specify them, with the + symbol:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9169585">
{lex(prepnp(na,acc),sg,&apos;my±l&apos;,
ratr({prepnp(o,loc);cp(»e);prepncp(o,loc,»e)} + {adjp(agr)}))}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.952138916666667">
Such argument specifications involving lex may get even more complex due to the fact that lex may
occur inside modification specifications of another lex, as in the following description of arguments
such as z otwartymi ramionami ‘with open arms’, more accurate than the one given at the beginning of
this subsection:
{lex(prepnp(z,inst),pl,&apos;rami¦&apos;,
ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,&apos;otwarty&apos;,natr)}))}
Note that lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,&apos;otwarty&apos;,natr) replaces adjp(agr) within ratr
and it specifies that not just any agreeing adjective phrase may modify the nominal form rgkami ‘arms’,
but only the simple adjective phrase consisting of an agreeing form of OTWARTY ‘open’ does.5
As discussed above, this is still not a complete description of the range of possibilities here, as the
adjective otwartymi ‘open’ may itself be modified (contrary to the natr specification above), namely, by
the adverb szeroko ‘wide’. A closer approximation is given below:6
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.506370333333333">
{lex(prepnp(z,inst),pl,&apos;rami¦&apos;,
ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,&apos;otwarty&apos;,
atr({lex(advp(misc),&apos;szeroko&apos;,natr)}))}))}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999325">
Note that this extension, with the possibility of lex recursion (of the centre-embedding type; Chomsky
1959), makes the language of schema specifications properly context-free.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999619">
2.3 Complex prepositions and fixed arguments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982836">
As noted in §1.3 above, the notation comprep(...) (e.g., comprepnp(z powodu)) is not suffi-
cient to model various combinatory properties of complex prepositions: some of them (e.g., z powodu
‘because of&apos;) may combine with a genitive NP or an agreeing adjective phrase, others (e.g., w trakcie
‘during’) may only co-occur with an NP, etc. We propose to reuse the lex notation to describe com-
plex prepositions in a more satisfactory manner. For example, one of valence schemata of uMARTWIAc
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.99669075">
5Recall that if adjp(...) is the first parameter of lex, the next two indicate gender and number, hence the two agrs
after adjp(agr).
6Sporadic examples of z bardzo szeroko otwartymi ramionami ‘with arms very wide open’ (note the additional bardzo ‘very’)
may be found on the internet, but we draw the line here and do not model such occurrences.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.999524">

<bodyText confidence="0.978121869565217">
sib ‘mortify oneself’, which specifies such a comprepnp(z powodu) argument, could specify it the
following way instead (with `_&apos; indicating any number here):
{lex(prepnp(z,gen),_,&apos;pow6d&apos;,ratr({np(gen);ncp(gen,»e)}+{adjp(agr)}))}
In contrast, the requirement of w trakcie (where the noun must be in the singular and adjectival modifi-
cation is not possible) could be spelled out this way:
{lex(prepnp(w,inst),sg,&apos;trakt&apos;,ratr({np(gen);ncp(gen,»e)}))}
As far as we can see, all complex prepositions could be described this way. On the other hand, there
are cases of fixed arguments which could not be so described simply because they contain forms
which cannot be specified with a reference to a lemma and morphosyntactic categories such as case
or number. One example is the argument of the form fixed(&apos;d¦ba&apos;), with the form dgba `oak.GEN&apos;
of the noun nays `oak&apos;, which co-occurs with forms sTANayc ‘stand’ in the idiomatic expression stangc
dgba ‘rear’ (of a horse), lit. ‘stand oak&apos;. However, since the form dgba is not used in contemporary
Polish (the contemporary genitive of nays is dgbu), this idiomatic argument cannot be expressed as
lex(np(gen),sg,&apos;dqb&apos;,natr), as then parsers would try to analyse the non-phraseological (at
best) sequence stangc dgbu as idiomatic. Instead, we propose to extend the fixed notation and add a pa-
rameter describing the general morphosyntax of such an argument, e.g., fixed(np(gen),&apos;d¦ba&apos;).
However, such fixed arguments with forms not attested in contemporary Polish are extremely rare
and we envisage that almost all other specifications currently involving fixed can be translated into
perhaps more precise specifications involving lex. For example, fixed(Ina kwa±ne jabªko&apos;),
used in zbic na kwasne jabtko ‘beat into a pulp’, literally meaning ‘into sour apple’, may be specified as
follows:
{lex(prepnp(na,acc),sg,&apos;jabªko&apos;,
ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,&apos;kwa±ny&apos;,natr)}))}
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998492">
2.4 Syntactic sugar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.923137260869565">
There are two types of syntactic sugar that we would like to propose together with the above extensions.
First of all, while it seems that the comprepnp notation for complex prepositions should be replaced
by lex, we propose to leave such comprepnp specifications in the dictionary proper and define them
in terms of lex specifications separately. The reason for this is that once a complex preposition occurs
in the specification of a valence schema, it has the tendency to occur in many schemata; for example,
comprepnp(z powodu) occurs in 126 schemata in the March 2014 version of Walenty. Replacing
all these occurrences with the considerably more complex lex specification given above would diminish
the readability of the dictionary. Instead, comprepnp(&apos;z powoduI) (perhaps with inverted commas,
to increase notational consistency) should be left in particular schemata and it should be defined in terms
of lex once for the whole dictionary.7
The other kind of abbreviatory notation is best illustrated with idiomatic arguments which have so far
required the batr modification indicator. Recall that batr means that a given noun may be modified
by forms of either of the two adjectives meaning ‘self’s, own&apos;, i.e., forms of sw61 and wr.AsNY. One
example is the verb sPR6BOwA6 `try&apos;, which may combine with the expression swoich/wtasnych sit ‘one’s
power’ rendering spróbowac swoich/wtasnych sit w czyms ‘try one’s hand at sth&apos;, lit. ‘try one’s powers in
something’. Given the notation introduced so far, this argument would have to be specified as follows:
{lex(np(gen),pl,&apos;siªa&apos;,ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,&apos;wªasny&apos;,natr)} +
{lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,&apos;sw6j&apos;,natr)}))}
This is not only hardly readable, but also misses the generalisation that the two possible modifiers are
just the same kinds of adjectival phrases differing only in the lexical realisation of the adjective meaning
‘self’s, own&apos;. We propose abbreviating such specifications as follows, with the use of OR:
{lex(np(gen),pl,&apos;siªa&apos;,
ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,OR(&apos;wªasny&apos;,&apos;sw6j&apos;),natr)}))}

such as xp(locat) or xp(temp) (see Przepiórkowski et al. 2014 for details).

While we could have reintroduced the batr notation to make this even more readable, this symbol is not
used in Walenty uniformly, so it would make sense to replace it with more explicit notation involving lex.
In particular, some argument specifications mentioning batr actually allow only for forms of wªasny,
not swój. This is, e.g., the case with dor¦czy¢ ‘hand (over)’, as in dorgczyc do rgk wlasnych (but not
dorgczyc do rqk swoich) ‘deliver as hand delivery’, lit. ‘hand to own hands’, where the specification of the
relevant argument in terms of lex explicitly mentions only one of these two adjectives:
{lex(prepnp(do,gen),pl,&apos;r¦ka&apos;,
ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,&apos;wªasny&apos;,natr)}))}
Note finally that this shorthand notation is useful not just in cases involving batr in the old formalism.
One case in point is the expression cos strzelilo komus do glowy ‘something came over somebody’, lit.
`something.nom shot sombody.dat to head.gen&apos;, where the form of gªowa ‘head’ may be replaced by
analogous forms of other nouns with the same meaning, including ªeb and ªepetyna, as specified below:8
{lex(prepnp(do,gen),sg,XOR(&apos;gªowa&apos;,&apos;ªeb&apos;,&apos;ªepetyna&apos;),atr({adjp(agr)}))}

<bodyText confidence="0.999967060606061">
In the current (as of the end of April 2014) version of Walenty, there are 7 complex prepositions used
691 times (in the schemata of 367 different verbs), 17 fixed phrases used 82 times (36 verbs), 177
lexnp phrases used 686 times (393 verbs) and 238 preplexnp phrases used 1133 times (496 verbs).
The last two contain 1182 natr parameters, 217 ratr parameters, 40 batr parameters and 406 atr
parameters. Summing up, there are 439 different lexicalisations used in 2567 schemata of 659 verbs.
This means that the representation of idiomatic schemata is already non-negligible, and it is bound to
increase, as more emphasis is put on such schemata in the current development of Walenty. Hence, the
proposed changes – if adopted – will involve substantial interference into an existing resource, and may
have a potentially adverse impact on the development of the lexicon, if the formalism proves to be too
difficult for lexicographers. This section describes an experiment investigating this issue.
We selected 84 schemata of 36 verbs and asked two main lexicographers involved in the development
of Walenty to rewrite these schemata using the proposed formalism. The schemata include 38 fixed
arguments, 10 comprepnp arguments, 17 lexnp arguments and 28 preplexnp arguments. The last
two contain 22 natr parameters, 6 ratr parameters, 4 batr parameters and 8 atr parameters. The
schemata were selected manually, taking into account their frequency, diversity of types of lexicalisations
and their parameters, as well as the expected difficulty of rewriting them. This is the reason for the over-
representation of fixed phrases, which need to be completely reanalysed. We chose multiple schemata
for the same verb, to give lexicographers the possibility to join them into a single schemata, given the
more expressive new formalism. In particular, all 12 lexicalised schemata for the verb sta¢ ’stand’ were
selected for the experiment.
The two lexicographers worked on the textual format of the dictionary (cf. http://zil.ipipan.
waw.pl/Walenty) without any support from a tool verifying the syntax of the schemata, etc. Cor-
respondingly, when comparing their results, we ignored purely syntactic errors, including differences in
bracketing etc., as such errors can be prevented by such a dedicated tool.
After ignoring such trivial differences, 34 of 84 schemata were found to be encoded differently by the
two lexicographers. The differences included 3 cases of a wrong lemma, 5 cases of different values of
grammatical categories of case, number, etc., and 7 differences concerning the introduction of new non-
lexicalised arguments or merging schemata on the basis of the coordination criterion mentioned in §1.1.
These differences are not directly connected with the proposed changes of the formalism for lexicalisa-
tions. Moreover, 9 differences concerned using (r)atr instead of (r)atr1 (cf. §2.2) where a single
realisation of a modifier is possible, as in the following (correct) argument specification for przemarzn¡¢
‘freeze’ surfacing in przemarzngc do szpiku kosci ‘freeze to the bone’, lit. ‘freeze to (the) marrow (of)
bone(s)’:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.979478">
8This argument specification uses XOR instead of OR as only one of the lexemes meaning ‘head’ may be used at a time,
unlike in the previous case, where forms of both swój and wªasny could be used simultaneously: spróbowac swoich wtasnych
sit w czyms lit. ‘try one’s own forces in something’.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.999213">

{lex(prepnp(do,gen),sg,&apos;szpik&apos;,ratr1({lex(np(gen),pl,&apos;ko±¢&apos;,natr)}))}
Since kosci must appear exactly once, ratr1 instead of ratr should be used here. Obviously, guidelines
for lexicographers should emphasise this point.
Finally, 17 differences concerned core aspects of the new formalism, such as different modification
patters (5), the lack of the morphosyntactic type for fixed (3) and an incorrect specification of the mor-
phosyntactic type of lex, e.g., lack of aspect of infp (2). We judged 6 of them as considerably difficult
cases of fixed lexicalisations, rewriting of which was not at all obvious. One such difficulty concerned
an idiomatic use of wYA6 ‘exit’ as in ktos wyszedt za kogos za mqz ‘somebody married somebody else’
(of a woman marrying a man, not the other way round), lit. `somebody.NOM exited PREP9 somebody.Acc
PREP husband’. The problem lies in the za mqz ‘PREP husband’ part, where mqz could be analysed as
the regular nominative, but then it would be unexpected that the preposition za occurs with a nominative
noun (it normally combines with the accusative and the instrumental), or as an idiosyncratic accusative
form only occurring in this idiom, similarly to dgba mentioned above occurring in stanqc dgba ‘rear’ –
in this case the exceptional use of fixed would be justified, even though the use of fixed was ex-
plicitly discouraged in this experiment. The two specifications of the argument za mqz given by the two
lexicographers are cited below10.
{fixed(prepnp(za,acc),&apos;za mq»&apos;)}
{lex(prepnp(za,nom),sg,&apos;mq»&apos;,natr)}
In summary, we feel that the experiment showed that the new formalism is relatively clear and can be
learnt by lexicographers, given some training. Support provided by a dedicated lexicographic tool should
reduce the number of errors, especially syntactic inconsistencies. On the other hand, the experiment
confirmed that some of the most difficult lexicalisations are those currently marked as fixed, and they
clearly require special attention.

Many valence dictionaries mark some valence schemata as idiomatic – this is true, e.g., of the VALBU
valence dictionary for German developed at the Institut für Deutsche Sprache (Schumacher et al. 2004;
http://hypermedia.ids-mannheim.de/evalbu/), of the VALLEX dictionary of Czech de-
veloped at the Charles University in Prague (Lopatková et al. 2006; http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/
vallex/), as well as some previous valence dictionaries of Polish, including Polanski 1980–1992 and
the dictionary that was used to bootstrap the first version of Walenty, i.e., Świdzinski 1998. However,
we are not aware of another valence dictionary that would explicitly describe lexicalised arguments at
the same level of detail as the version of Walenty presented in Przepiórkowski et al. 2014. Regardless of
this level of detail, though, the formalism employed in that version suffers from a number of problems
discussed in §1.3, limiting its ability to describe phraseological constructions precisely.
In this paper, we propose a far-reaching extension of the formalism of Walenty, making it possible to
describe the syntactic structure of a lexicalised argument to any necessary depth. As noted in §2.2, the
proposed extension makes the description language properly context-free, but this does not seem to be a
problem for parsers employing the valence dictionary. On the contrary, as the parsers of Polish become
more sophisticated and are developed with full semantic parsing in view, they need precise description of
valence schemata that makes it possible to reliably distinguish idiomatic arguments from non-idiomatic
compositional constructions.
The need for such deeper description of phraseological arguments in valence dictionaries has occa-
sionally been expressed in the literature, e.g., by 2abokrtský (2005, 65–66, fn. 20), who notes that “[i]n
case of multiword parts of phrasemes, the tree (and not only the sequence of forms) representing this part
should be ideally captured in the lexicon...”. This makes us hope that the current proposal will prove
interesting also for the developers of valence lexica for languages other than Polish.

Walenty contains some valence schemata for verbal idioms; e.g., one of the schemata for xuc ‘forge’ says that it combines with a nominal subject, a nominal object and a prepositional phrase consisting of the preposition NA `on&apos; and the accusative singular form of the noun PAMi�c ‘memory’ – this represents the idiom ktos kuje cos na pamigc ‘somebody rote learns something’, lit. ‘somebody forges something onto memory’. The current formalism handles various kinds of verbal phraseological constructions (cf. §1.2), but also has clear </context>

Crucially, though, the object is specified here not just as an NP, but also alternatively as an interrogative (int) clausal argument (cp, for complementiser phrase). A parser may take this information into account and properly analyse a sentence with unlike coordination like the one involving TLuMACZYC ‘explain’, given in the previous paragraph.

For example, ZosACZYC `see&apos; is involved in an idiom meaning `to see with one’s own eyes’, as in Na wlasne oczy zobaczylem jej usmiech i to, ze nie byla wcale taka stara ‘With my own eyes I saw her smile and that she wasn’t so old at all&apos;:2 subj{np(str)} + {np(str); ncp(str,»e)} + {preplexnp(na,acc,pl,&apos;oko&apos;,batr)} We will see below that a more expressive – and more general – scheme for the representation of phraseological valence is needed. 1.3 Limitations A number of problems were identified with the formalism of Walenty as it was described in Przepiórkowski et al. 2014 and summarised above. To start with the simplest cases, it is a simplification to say that complex prepositions (comprepnp above) are internally unanalysable and always combine with genitive NPs. For example, while z powodu ‘because ofccannot occur without any additional dependents, it is sufficient for the nominal form powodu ‘reason’ to be modified by an appropriate adjectival form for the whole expression to be complete, e.g., z tego powodu ‘because of this’, lit. `of this reason’, z waznego powodu lit. `of important reason’, etc. This is not a general feature of such complex prepositions,</context>

We propose abbreviating such specifications as follows, with the use of OR: {lex(np(gen),pl,&apos;siªa&apos;, ratr({lex(adjp(agr),agr,agr,OR(&apos;wªasny&apos;,&apos;sw6j&apos;),natr)}))} 7This move would be analogous to specifying externally morphosyntactic realisations of semantically defined arguments such as xp(locat) or xp(temp) (see Przepiórkowski et al. 2014 for details). 88 While we could have reintroduced the batr notation to make this even more readable, this symbol is not used in Walenty uniformly, so it would make sense to replace it with more explicit notation involving lex. In particular, some argument specifications mentioning batr actually allow only for forms of wªasny, not swój. This is, e.g., the case with dor¦czy¢ ‘hand (over)’, as in dorgczyc do rgk wlasnych (but not dorgczyc do rqk swoich) ‘deliver as hand delivery’, lit. ‘hand to own hands’, where the specification of the relevant argument in terms of lex explicitly mentions only </context>

However, we are not aware of another valence dictionary that would explicitly describe lexicalised arguments at the same level of detail as the version of Walenty presented in Przepiórkowski et al. 2014. Regardless of this level of detail, though, the formalism employed in that version suffers from a number of problems discussed in §1.3, limiting its ability to describe phraseological constructions precisely. In this paper, we propose a far-reaching extension of the formalism of Walenty, making it possible to describe the syntactic structure of a lexicalised argument to any necessary depth. </context>

We believe that these traits make the current proposal to further extend the underlying formalism potentially interesting to the wider audience. 1.1 Walenty Walenty is a valence dictionary which is meant to be both human- and machine-readable; in particular, it is being employed by two parsers of Polish, Świgra (an implementation of a Definite Clause Grammar description of fragments of Polish syntax; Wolinski 2004) and POLFIE (an implementation of a Lexical Functional Grammar description of fragments of Polish; Patejuk and Przepiórkowski 2012). As these parsers are based on two rather different linguistic approaches, the valence dictionary must be sufficiently expressive to accommodate for the needs of both – and perhaps other to come. Each verb is assigned a number of valence schemata1 and each schema is a set of argument specifications. Walenty is explicit about what counts as an argument: if two morphosyntactically different phrases may occur coordinated in an argument position, they are taken to be </context>

Obviously, guidelines for lexicographers should emphasise this point. Finally, 17 differences concerned core aspects of the new formalism, such as different modification patters (5), the lack of the morphosyntactic type for fixed (3) and an incorrect specification of the morphosyntactic type of lex, e.g., lack of aspect of infp (2). We judged 6 of them as considerably difficult cases of fixed lexicalisations, rewriting of which was not at all obvious. One such difficulty concerned an idiomatic use of wYA6 ‘exit’ as in ktos wyszedt za kogos za mqz ‘somebody married somebody else’ (of a woman marrying a man, not the other way round), lit. `somebody.NOM exited PREP9 somebody.Acc PREP husband’. The problem lies in the za mqz ‘PREP husband’ part, where mqz could be analysed as the regular nominative, but then it would be unexpected that the preposition za occurs with a nominative noun (it normally combines with the accusativ</context>

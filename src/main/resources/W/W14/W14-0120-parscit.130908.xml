<bodyText confidence="0.9998624">
This paper reports on the development of
the prototype African Wordnet (AWN)
which currently includes four languages.
The resource has been developed by
translating Common Base Concepts from
English, and currently holds roughly 42
000 synsets. We describe here how some
language specific and technical challenges
have been overcome and discuss efforts to
localise the content of the wordnet and
quality assurance methods. A comparison
of the number of synsets per language is
given before concluding with plans to
fast-track the development and for
dissemination of the resource.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884782608696">
Wordnets for African languages were
introduced with a training workshop for
linguists, lexicographers and computer
scientists facilitated by international experts in
2007. The development of wordnet prototypes
for four official South African languages
started in 2008 as the African Wordnet Project.
This project was based on collaboration
between the Department of African Languages
at the University of South Africa (UNISA) and
the Centre for Text Technology (CTexT) at the
North-West University (NWU), as well as
support from the developers of the DEBVisDic
tools at the Masaryk University1. The initiative
resulted in first versions of wordnets for
isiZulu [zul], isiXhosa [xho], Setswana [tsn]
and Sesotho sa Leboa (Sepedi) [nso]2, all
members of the Bantu language family. An
expansion of the African Wordnet followed in
2011, and currently the development has
entered a third phase that aims at solidifying
the African Wordnets as a valued resource
with formal quality assurance, as well as

further expansion of the synsets, definitions
and usage examples. Figure 1 gives an
overview of the development, as well as the
deliverables in each phase.
In this paper, we reflect critically on the
previous phases in development including
challenges faced and solutions to some
common problems. Section 3 gives a brief
report on the current standing of the African
wordnets and sections 4 and 5 give details
regarding future work.

2 Status quo after the first 2 phases
During the first phase (2008-2010), linguists
who had participated in the introductory
workshop were invited to partake in the
project. Linguists representing the four
languages mentioned above, volunteered and
since then, the development has been constant
with two phases completed. Table 1 gives a
summary of the total number of synsets and
definitions that have been developed thus far.

As will be mentioned in section 3, the team
faced many challenges and had to apply some
creative problem solving at times. During the
first two phases, important fundamental
training and development had to be done, for
instance a second workshop, again facilitated
by international wordnet experts was held at
the beginning of 2011, followed by training on
more technical aspects of wordnet
development such as automated quality
control, in 2012. The core project team has
stayed largely unchanged and renewed funding
for a third phase of development contributed to
the continued growth of the African Wordnets.

3 Challenges to the development of
African Wordnets

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999996">
3.1 Availability of resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998476">
The languages in this project are considered
resource scarce compared to most other
languages listed in The Global WordNet
Organization3 in the sense that lexical
resources are relatively limited. The four
languages included in the project so far,
however, each have at least one or two paper
dictionaries available, ranging from
monolingual to bilingual general purpose or
learners’ dictionaries. Apart from a basic on-
line dictionary for Sesotho sa Leboa4 and
isiZulu.net5, which is an online isiZulu-English
dictionary that anyone can contribute to,
containing bidirectional lookups as well as
basic morphological decomposition, there are
no online or machine-readable lexicons
available for any of the languages.
Currently only relatively restricted
unannotated and not freely accessible corpora
are available. For example, the University of

Pretoria Corpora (Prinsloo &amp; de Schryver,
2005:101) range from approximately two to
nine million tokens for the various South
African languages. Three types of corpora
have been collected, viz. general purpose
(LGP) corpora, special-purpose (LSP) corpora
and true parallel corpora. The main
characteristics of the eleven South African
LGP corpora, which are the biggest of the
three types built, are shown in Table 2.

Smaller, unannotated parallel corpora are
freely available from the newly established
Resource Management Agency (RMA).
Recently the NLP Group of the University of
Leipzig has also made corpora for most of the
languages in the African Wordnet project,
freely available (Wortschatz Universität
Leipzig, 2013). Although these corpora are
unannotated and still relatively small, the
development work seems promising.
The agglutinating nature of the African
languages belonging to the Bantu language
family, particularly for those with a
conjunctive orthography e.g. isiZulu and
isiXhosa, call for morphological annotation
for the purposes of accurate corpus searches.
Although prototypes of rule-based
morphological analysers have been developed
for the mentioned two languages, these are not
freely available yet (cf. Bosch et al., 2008).
Due to the limited availability of
lexicographic and basic language resources
for the African languages, wordnet
construction thus presents a challenging and
time-consuming task for the linguists.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999829">
3.2 Language specific challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997473">
A number of language specific challenges
anticipated at the beginning of the project are
discussed in Le Roux et al. (2007) and will not
be repeated here. However, a number of
additional challenges were encountered, some
of which are dealt with in more detail in a
parallel paper (cf. Mojapelo, 2014). For
example, consider the following synset for
“breaststroke”6:
{00572097} &lt;noun.act&gt;[04] S: (n)
breaststroke#1 (a swimming stroke;
the arms are extended together in front
of the head and swept back on either
side accompanied by a frog kick)
A whole discussion arose around the isiZulu
version of the above synset since a dictionary
entry of the verb -gwedla (swim by
breaststroke OR paddle/row) was found in a
bilingual dictionary (Doke &amp; Vilakazi,
1964:285). The debate among linguists was
whether -gwedla in the infinitive, i.e.
ukugwedla (lit. to swim by breaststroke) would
be a suitable representation in isiZulu. Some
felt that -gwedla is more commonly used in the
context of ‘rowing an actual boat’. To
complicate matters, no equivalents for other
swimming strokes such as butterfly,
backstroke, freestyle etc. are lexicalised in
isiZulu, or for that matter, any of the languages
in the project.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999284">
3.3 Technical challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963727272727">
One of the major worries for the African
Wordnets team, was securing continual
funding for the very important base work. Not
only was funding needed to provide technical
assistance and project management, but also to
reimburse linguists for the linguistic
development of the wordnets. All of the
linguists involved with this project are
employed full time at academic institutions
and are not able to devote much of their
workday to development of the wordnets,

<bodyText confidence="0.999977580645161">
slowing progress almost to a standstill. The
BalkaNet project, for instance, also
incentivised or contracted the initial
development of wordnets for Bulgarian, Greek,
Romanian, Serbian and Turkish. The core
wordnets delivered at the end of the 3 year
project contained roughly 8000 synsets,
developed in 3 years – comparative to our 10
000 synsets in each of our African wordnets.
The Serbian team then continued development
on a voluntary basis and in the next 2 years
(2006 – 2008) could only add another 2240
synsets (Krstev et al., 2008). This supports our
decision to apply for further funding and
continue incentivising the development in
order to speed up the process to a point that the
wordnets are a truly useful tool for the creation
of other NLP applications (where an excess of
200 000 synsets have proven to make a
considerable difference in the quality those
applications can deliver).
A number of problems with the connection
to the server were reported by the linguists.
These problems related mainly to the high
level of network security and restricted access
at the universities involved. The project team
was dependent on collaboration of IT-
departments from three universities, as we had
no direct control over security policies,
firewalls, etc. The distance between the
linguists (mostly at UNISA in Pretoria, South
Africa) and the support team (NWU in
Potchefstroom, some 160 km away) also posed
a threat to project progress. This risk was
managed through an intent focus on regular
communication between the sites, and the
implementation of a backup plan, namely
reverting to working on Microsoft® Excel
spreadsheets during ‘down-time’, and then
importing them to the database and online
DEBVisDic environment afterwards. Some
linguists also experienced regular interruptions
in internet connectivity due to a weaker
infrastructure in the whole of South Africa.
Being able to revert to this offline method,
meant that they could continue working from
home without needing a constant internet
connection.
Human capital development also took time
and since this is the first project of its kind for
African languages, new technical skills, like
working with the DEBVisDic tools, had to be
learnt. Because of the slow progress in the first
project, the project team had to include more
linguists in the development of synsets and
definitions than initially planned. The
advantages of this were twofold. Not only did
the progress speed up significantly and were
we able to deliver the contracted number of
new synsets and definitions on time, but more
South African linguists were trained in
development of wordnets.

</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997579">
4.1 Introducing the third phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996882352941">
The aim of the current third project is an
extended scope of the African Wordnet Project
which gained considerable momentum over the
past 4 years. Our primary aim is to develop at
least 15 000 new synsets and definitions, to
add usage examples to existing synsets and to
do continual quality assurance on the
wordnets. Most importantly, a 5th African
language, Tshivenda [ven], is being added to
the project. From the previous phases, it
became clear that a stronger emphasis needs to
be placed on localisation of the wordnet. It was
found that many synsets in the English
wordnet are not concepts that belong in the
African environment (lexicalised items).
During this phase, greater care will be taken to
ensure that truly African synsets are included.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.986174">
4.2 Quality assessment and semi-
automatic assistance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997532318181818">
As mentioned earlier, very few core
technologies exist for the resource scarce
African languages. For this reason, many of
the internationally proven methods to do
quality assessment on wordnets could not be
applied (cf. Smrz, 2004 and Kotzé, 2008). The
team did have access to proprietary spelling
checkers developed for Microsoft® Office.
These spelling checkers can be seen as so
called first generation technologies, since very
little language analysis like with grammar or
morphological analysers is available and they
rely strongly on lexicon lookup.
The Excel sheets and online versions of the
wordnets were consolidated in a single XML
file per language before three categories of
possible errors were identified automatically.
Cells with potential problems were indicated
with coloured formatting and linguists were
asked to pay special attention while doing
quality assessment to these cells. The error
categories are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.98396125">
• Possible spelling errors,
• Empty (critical) fields, and
• Formatting errors (i.e. missing or
invalid sense numbers, English IDs
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.790272">
and SUMO/MILO relations,
recognised with a simple Perl script).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998245">
4.3 Localisation of the base concepts
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956375">
Most of the initial decisions made regarding
the design of the African wordnets, were based
on the experiences of 2 international projects,
namely the BalkaNet project and the EuroNet
Project. In both these successful endeavours,
the project teams drew up an initial list of the
most important concepts to use as seed terms
to start building wordnets. These so-called
Base Concepts are regarded as “the
fundamental building blocks for establishing
the relations in a wordnet and give information
about the dominant lexicalization patterns in
languages” (GWA, 2013). The list of Common
Base Concepts created in the EuroNet project
contains roughly 1024 synsets. These Common
Base Concepts were extended to 5000 synsets
and mapped to the Princeton WordNet 2.0 in
the BalkaNet project, using a similar approach,
but applied to other (mostly European)
languages.
During the first 2 phases, we followed the
guidance given in the extended Common Base
Concepts lists. It soon became clear that a
more localised approach was needed, as this
and the Princeton Core Concepts list7 contain
concepts that do not accurately describe the
African context. Linguists were spending too
much time on foreign concepts and especially
the less experienced linguists did not have the
confidence to venture off this list too far. Table
3 gives some examples of nouns that are not
lexicalised in the African languages.

<bodyText confidence="0.999796652173913">
When adding the new Tshivenda wordnet to
this project, we decided to take a careful look
at the concepts we use as the seed terms. Our
premise was that more localised terms might
be extracted from real-world parallel corpora.
To examine the difference, a multilingual
parallel corpus, including English, Setswana,
isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho sa Leboa and
Tshivenda equivalents was acquired from the
RMA. The English version of the parallel
corpus contained 50 000 tokens and was used
to compare the African languages data to the
Princeton core concepts.
From the multilingual corpus, we extracted
a frequency list for Tshivenda and Setswana.
The next step was to compare the 5000 most
frequent Tshivenda and Setswana words in the
multilingual African wordlist to the list of
(English) base and core concepts mentioned
above. Table 4 below shows some of the
concepts unique to the African language list.
The frequency of the word is given in
brackets.

Table 4. Frequent nouns from a large multilingual

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970666666667">
It is clear that our frequency list includes
concepts that reflect unique African language
usage. The Princeton and EuroNets lists both
include concepts that might not be completely
unknown in an African context, but that
certainly are less commonly used.
The new approach proposed in this third
phase of the African Wordnets project entails
extracting a subset of concepts that were
present in this list. We now have a list of
concepts that are both internationally regarded
and frequent in African corpora. This new list
of roughly 1000 concepts was shared with the
linguists as a starting point for Tshivenda. For
the other four languages, we extracted the list
of concepts that were not added in the previous
projects to use as a starting point for new
development in this phase.

Figures 2 and 3 represent the total number of
synsets and definitions for each language
combination. This comparative review gives a
clear indication of fast-tracking possibilities
for each language by using the
synsets/definitions of its closely related

definitions developed for isiZulu and not for
isiXhosa, can be fast-tracked for the latter
since both languages belong to the Nguni
language group, and vice versa. On the other
hand, synsets or definitions developed for
Setswana and not for Sesotho sa Leboa
(Sepedi), can be fast-tracked for the latter since
both languages belong to the Sotho language

Since the resource that will be further
developed in this project is vital to so many
linguistic and language technology
endeavours, it is essential that it be accessible
to all researchers in the field. After quality
assurance (see section 4.2) the wordnets will
be included in the repository of the RMA, who
will advertise and make available the wordnets
for others to use. The appropriate licensing
options and usage rights (most probably under
one of the Creative Commons licenses8), will
also be determined in conjunction with the
RMA.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970756">
5.3 Conclusion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964722222222">
The African Wordnet project is unique in its
approach to create wordnets for several
languages in parallel, resulting in a very
important language resource. This approach
allows team members to share experiences
during the process and thus build the lexicon
more effectively. It also allows for a
multilingual resource that can be applied in
various other technologies, such as for
machine translation, extracting content for
learner&apos;s dictionaries and other teaching
material, but also as a reference for linguists.
There is still much work to be done, but by
learning from previous projects and keeping
the ultimate goal of a rich linguistc resource in
mind, we trust that this work will fill many
gaps in NLP in South Africa and Africa as a
whole.

We describe here how some language specific and technical challenges have been overcome and discuss efforts to localise the content of the wordnet and quality assurance methods. A comparison of the number of synsets per language is given before concluding with plans to fast-track the development and for dissemination of the resource.</abstract>

However, a number of additional challenges were encountered, some of which are dealt with in more detail in a parallel paper (cf. Mojapelo, 2014). For example, consider the following synset for “breaststroke”6: {00572097} &lt;noun.act&gt;[04] S: (n) breaststroke#1 (a swimming stroke; the arms are extended together in front of the head and swept back on either side accompanied by a frog kick) A whole discussion arose around the isiZulu version of the above synset since a dictionary entry of the verb -gwedla (swim by breaststroke OR paddle/row) was found in a bilingual dictionary (Doke &amp; Vilakazi, 1964:285). The debate among linguists was whether -gwedla in the infinitive, i.e. ukugwedla (lit. to swim by breaststroke) would be a suitable representation in isiZulu. Some felt that -gwedla is more commonly used in the context of ‘rowing an actual boat’. To complicate matters, no equivalents for other swimming strokes such as butterfly, backstroke, freestyle etc. are lexicalised in isiZulu, or for that matter, any of the languages in the project. 3.3 Technical challenges One of the major worries for the African Wordnets team, was securing continual funding for the very important base work.

It was found that many synsets in the English wordnet are not concepts that belong in the African environment (lexicalised items). During this phase, greater care will be taken to ensure that truly African synsets are included. 4.2 Quality assessment and semiautomatic assistance As mentioned earlier, very few core technologies exist for the resource scarce African languages. For this reason, many of the internationally proven methods to do quality assessment on wordnets could not be applied (cf. Smrz, 2004 and Kotzé, 2008). The team did have access to proprietary spelling checkers developed for Microsoft® Office. These spelling checkers can be seen as so called first generation technologies, since very little language analysis like with grammar or morphological analysers is available and they rely strongly on lexicon lookup. The Excel sheets and online versions of the wordnets were consolidated in a single XML file per language before three categories of possible errors were identified automatically. Cells with potential problems were indicated with coloured formatting and linguists were asked to pay special at</context>

This paper describes the three phases of
the Durkheim Project. For this project
we developed a clinician&apos;s dashboard that
displays output of models predicting sui-
cide risk of veterans and active duty mili-
tary personnel. During phase one, we
built the clinician’s dashboard and com-
pleted a Veterans Affairs (VA) predictive
risk medical records study, based on an
analysis of the narrative, or free text, por-
tions of VA medical records, In phase
two, we will predict suicide risk based on
opt-in social media postings by patients
using social media websites, e.g., Face-
book. We describe the software infra-
structure that we have completed for this
phase two system. During phase three
we will provide a three layer intervention
strategy. We discuss our methodology
for the three phases, including IRB-
approved protocols for the first two phas-
es and a soon-to-be approved IRB proto-
col for phase three.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999838705882353">
Diagnosis of psychological health and the predic-
tion of negative events, such as suicide, or sui-
cide ideation, is limited by: a) a lack of under-
standing of the true differentiating risks of sui-
cidality (Health Promotion, 2010; Treating Sol-
diers, 2010) and b) a lack of near real-time reac-
tion capability to large volumes of data. There is
a need for broader coverage suicide risk detec-
tion and a better understanding of the expression
of suicide ideation through data mining of text
and images. The Durkheim Project’s proposed
solution is to provide continuous monitoring of
text based information, such as found in social
network user behavioral intent enabling interven-
tion; facilitated by social / online data sources,
powered by a medically-validated suicide risk
classifier.

2 Suicide risk and military culture
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999866787878788">
The suicide rate among members of the United
States Armed Forces has continued to rise for the
past decade, beginning soon after the onset of
military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sui-
cide is now the second-leading cause of death
among military personnel, with more service
members dying by suicide in 2012 than by com-
bat-related causes (Zoroya, 2012). In response to
steadily rising suicide rates among military per-
sonnel and veterans, researchers, clinicians, poli-
cy-makers, and military leaders have responded
with an overwhelming and concerted effort to
reverse these trends. Despite these considerable
efforts, however, no evidence of effectiveness
has been observed to date, resulting in consider-
able frustration for all involved. Although specif-
ic reasons explaining the lack of success to date
are not yet known, it has been noted that most
suicide prevention efforts used with military and
veteran populations lack cultural relevance and
do not incorporate several critical characteristics
of the military culture that can create unique
challenges from a suicide prevention perspective
(Bryan et al., 2012). For instance, mental tough-
ness and suppressive coping, fearlessness of
death, and self-sacrifice are qualities that are val-
ued in the military, but can serve as barriers to
traditional prevention efforts.
The military culture values strength, resilience,
courage, and personal sacrifice when faced with
adversity. Weakness is not tolerated, and service
members are expected to “shake it off” or “suck
it up” when experiencing problems or illness.

Suppression and avoidance have long been
linked to mental health problems and emotional
distress (Hayes et al., 1996), including suicidal
ideation and suicide attempts (Najmi et al.,
2007). Yet despite this “common sense” piece of
knowledge, suppression and avoidance are none-
theless taught and reinforced within the military
culture as a coping strategy because, in the short
term after a stressful or traumatic event, suppres-
sion can actually reduce emotional distress and
foster adaptation to extreme adversity (Beck et
al., 2006; Bonanno 2004). This is especially rel-
evant in combat situations, when natural grief
responses may need to be suppressed to sustain
adequate performance and achieve mission ob-
jectives. For example, crying in the midst of a
fire fight is not adaptive or conducive to survival,
and therefore must be stifled. Suppression and
avoidance therefore presents the first paradox for
understanding military and veteran suicide: a
skill that is adaptive and useful in the short-term
following a traumatic event can be detrimental
and impair adaptive functioning in the long-term.
Military personnel are also explicitly trained to
overcome their fear of injury and death, typically
through repeated exposure to scenarios and envi-
ronments that increasingly mimic actual combat
situations, which habituates them to fear and
eventually replaces this fear with exhilaration
and/or other positive emotions (i.e., the oppo-
nent-process). Indeed, greater exposure to com-
bat, especially combat marked by higher levels
of violence and injury, are associated with less
fear of death among military personnel (Bryan
and Cukrowicz, 2011; Bryan et al. 2011). Fear-
lessness is an essential quality of a service mem-
ber; retreating from danger and life-threatening
situations are generally not conducive to an ef-
fective fighting force. Yet at the same time, fear
of death is a well-known protective factor for
suicide, given that individuals who are afraid to
die are unlikely to attempt suicide, and fearless-
ness is associated with more severe levels of sui-
cide risk among military personnel relative to
civilian samples, and is associated with increased
severity of suicide risk among military personnel
(Bryan et al., 2010). Consequently, fearlessness
about death paradoxically serves both as a neces-
sary strength and asset for military personnel, yet
also serves as a risk factor for suicide.
The military culture also places a premium on
selflessness in the service of a higher good, and
does not necessarily view life as the highest good
in every situation. In the military, one’s life
might actually be viewed as subordinate to other,
higher “goods” such as the well-being of others
or ideals and principles such as freedom and jus-
tice. Laying down one’s life for a greater good is
widely considered to be one of the highest hon-
ors a service member can achieve. A considera-
ble amount of research has converged on a very
suicide-specific and dangerous thought process
for suicidal behavior: perceived burdensomeness.
Perceived burdensomeness entails the mistaken
perception that “others would be better off with-
out me” or that one’s death is of greater value
than one’s life. Perceived burdensomeness and
self-sacrifice are in many ways opposite sides of
the same coin, and it is not yet clear how or when
perceived burdensomeness (“taking” one’s life)
becomes mistaken for self-sacrifice (“giving”
one’s life) among military personnel and veter-
ans.
These characteristics simultaneously function as
an asset (in terms of military performance) and
as a liability (in terms of suicide prevention) for
military personnel and veterans, thereby creating
a paradox for suicide prevention in military and
veteran populations, and contributing directly to
mental health stigma. Furthermore, the values of
the military culture are generally at odds with the
values and ideals of mental health systems,
which value emotional vulnerability and help-
seeking, and focus on deficiencies and clinical
disorders, thereby reinforcing stigma even more.
In essence, traditional prevention approaches
have conceptualized suicide in a way that con-
flicts with the core identity and values of military
personnel and veterans. To be effective, suicide
prevention efforts must be culturally-relevant
and integrate these values and ideals of military
personnel and veterans.

In addition to the work related to military culture
issues discussed in section 2, there are many lin-

(Barak and Miron, 2005; Jones and Bennell,

suicide notes. There are studies of the writings
of suicidal poets (Lester and McSwain, 2010;

4.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985802517241379">
The Durkheim Project consists of three phases.
During the first phase, described in section 4.2, a
clinician’s dashboard was built and a Veterans
Affairs (VA) predictive risk medical records
study was completed, based on an analysis of the
narrative, or free text, portions of VA medical
records. Also during the first phase, the initial
software infrastructure to collect and analyze the
social media data for phase two, was designed
and implemented. During the second phase, sec-
tion 4.3, now underway, opt-in social media
postings are being collected and will be ana-
lyzed. During the third phase, section 4.4, a pilot
program will isolate serious suicide risk for indi-
viduals in real-time, and develop a prediction
triage model for improved suicide intervention
4.2 Phase 1: Veteran Affairs medical records
study
During phase 1 linguistics-driven prediction
models were developed to estimate the risk of
suicide. These models were generated from un-
structured clinical notes taken from a national
sample of United States VA medical records.
The protocol for this study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the VA
Medical Center, where the study was conducted.
We created three matched cohorts: veterans who
completed suicide, veterans who used mental
health services and did not complete suicide, and
veterans who did not use mental health services
and did not complete suicide during the observa-
tion period (n = 70 in each group). From the clin-
ical notes, we generated datasets of single key-
words and multi-word phrases, and constructed
prediction models using a supervised machine-
learning algorithm based on a genetic program-
ming framework, MOSES (Looks, 2006, 2007;
Goertzel et al., 2013). MOSES can be described
as a variant of a decision-tree forest, with certain
genetic and maximum entropy techniques mixed
in: maximum entropy to apply pressure to min-
imize tree size and genetic to ensure tree species
diversity. In our prior research we have found
that MOSES consistently outperforms standard
text classification approaches, such as Support
Vector Machines (SVMs). The primary hyper-
parameter that we used was the dynamic feature
size. The resulting inference accuracy was at
first 65% and then consistently 67% or more.
This was the prediction accuracy for assigning a
patient to the correct cohort. These data suggest
that computerized text analytics can be applied to
unstructured sections of medical records to esti-
mate the risk of suicide (Poulin et al. 2014). The
resulting system could potentially allow clini-
cians to screen seemingly healthy patients at the
primary care level, and to continuously evaluate
suicide risk among psychiatric patients.

4.3 Phase 2: Predicting risk with opt-in social
media postings
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976222222222">
Although data collection and analysis for phase 2
is just beginning, the software development re-
quired for this data collection and analysis was
completed during phase 1. A phase 2 protocol
for collecting and analyzing opt-in social media
postings and presenting predictions to clinicians
via the Durkheim Project’s Clinicians’ dashboard
has also been approved by our IRB. When the
system is fully operational, a clinician will see
predictive models of suicide risk for a patient
constructed from the patient’s medical records
and the patient’s opt-in social media postings.
Subjects are being recruited via targeted efforts.
Subjects will be recruited through our collabora-
tion with Facebook (PR Newswire 2013). A Fa-
cebook pop-up window will be used to recruit
people that Facebook has identified as being mil-
itary personnel or veterans.

4.4 Phase 3: Intervention
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999762">
For phase 3, a protocol has been completed,
which will soon be submitted to a final IRB.
This protocol includes an unblinded, 3-cohort
design, for a pilot program, which proposes to
isolate serious suicide risks for individuals in
real-time and to develop a prediction triage mod-
el for improved suicide intervention. Plans are to
use and improve upon the linguistically-based
prediction capabilities of the model developed
during phase 1. The phase 1 retrospective study
was able to predict with limited accuracy before
suicides occurred. The theoretic assumption is
that wording chosen by those at risk will vary at
different stages of risk. By building from ongo-
ing observations from the phase 2 study and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999994775">
feedback obtained during the conduct of the
phase 3 study, the aim is to adjust the linguistics-
driven model to predict suicide risk within the
critical period for interventions of various levels
of severity.
In this protocol, ongoing monitoring of the net-
work will allow continuous updating and change
in value of risk alert levels among the green-to-
red color coding. When the predictive system
detects postings that indicate a certain threshold
level of potential suicide risk, risk alerts are trig-
gered in real-time and sent to either a monitoring
clinician or a pre-identified buddy monitor, or to
an automated system, which will generate sup-
portive messages that are sent to the at-risk indi-
vidual.
To better characterize the risk for the population
of active-duty military and veterans, the analysis
for this study will be limited to the primary par-
ticipants. These primary participants may be
newly recruited via the dedicated Facebook and
mobile applications or, through that same dedi-
cated application, from among those already par-
ticipating in the phase 2 study. In either case, all
primary participants must provide informed con-
sent for this specific study. That is, those already
involved in the phase 2 study must provide sepa-
rate consent to participate in the phase 3 study.
However, outside of the context of this study, the
computerized intervention will be open to mem-
bers of the general public who might wish to take
advantage of the program’s intervention poten-
tial. Primary participants are active duty U.S.
military or veterans with English as a primary or
secondary language, who agree to post to social
media using English. The age limit for primary
participants in the phase 3 study, as with phase 2
study, targets the age group most likely to active-
ly use social media, i.e., those between the ages
of 18 and 45.

5 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973">
So far results are only available for the phase
1 study. For single-word models, the predic-
tive accuracy was approximately 59% (the
average for 100 models), and scores for indi-
vidual candidate models ranged from 46-
67%. Because our training sets are balanced,
we have used accuracy as a surrogate for
precision and recall. Accuracy was comput-
ed using five-way cross-validation. Models
that used certain word pairs had significantly
better scores than single-word models,
though they are far less human readable. The
phrases “negative assessment for PTSD” and
“positive assessment for PTSD&amp;quot; carry differ-
ent meanings. This phrase-based approach
was more accurate than a single-word ap-
proach. For pre-selected word pairs, the in-
dividual model scores ranged from 52-69%,
with an average of 64% (for 100 models). In
the final experiments, the combined Cohorts
‘1v2v3 classifier’ had a peak performance of
70%, and an average performance of 67%.

Our analyses were successful at determining
useful text-based signals of suicide risk. We
obtained accuracies of greater than 60% for
ensemble averages of 100 models, and our
individual model accuracies reached 67-
69%. Given the small size of the dataset and
the fragmentary nature of the clinical notes,
this performance level represents a signifi-
cant achievement. For a classifier, these re-
sults represent a statistically significant ‘sig-
nal’. Meanwhile, we showed that, methodo-
logically, word pairs are more useful than
single words for model construction on elec-
tronic medical record (EMR) data. Fur-
thermore, the predictive feature words that
distinguished each group were highly reveal-
ing, especially for the suicidal cohort, and
were consistent with the existing medical
literature on suicide. Many medical condi-
tions have been associated with an increased
risk for suicide, but these conditions have
generally not been included in suicide risk
assessment tools. These conditions include
gastrointestinal conditions, cardiopulmonary
conditions, oncologic conditions, and pain
conditions. Also, some research has emerged
that links care processes to suicide risk. The
word &amp;quot;integrated&amp;quot; emerged as a key term in
our study and is also reflected in the inte-
grated care literature (Bauer et al., 2013).
Although the text on which our predictive
model was based for the phase 1 medical
records study was text written by a physician
or other healthcare provider, our hypothesis
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995649">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957297297297">
is that some of the highly predictive features
learned during phase 1 will carry over to the
predictive modeling of opt-in social media
postings during phase 2. This text is written
by the patient. However, we expect that
some of the features, or concepts, will be the
same due to the ability to do software based
synonym matches Additionally, a physician
or other healthcare worker may sometimes
quote or paraphrase what a patient said when
adding a note to the clinical record. A key
predictive feature, such as the word “anxie-
ty,” may be used either by a clinician or a
patient. We believe that the use of special-
ized text-analytic resources such as linguistic
inquiry and word count (LIWC) would also
help improve our results. Some preliminary
results have been obtained using LIWC on
our dataset.
In future research we plan to scale up the
phase 1 medical records study from our cur-
rent study where each cohort had 70 subjects
to a study, using the same protocol, with at
least 1000 subjects in each cohort. We also
plan to transfer the predictive model built
from the phase 1 study to the analysis of
phase 2 opt-in social media postings. Once
our phase 3 protocol has IRB approval, we
plan to begin the phase 3 of the Durkheim
Project, informed by the results, and on-
going follow-on research, of our phase 1 and
2 studies. In our future research we plan to
use additional features from the structured
portions of the medical record, as well as to
use LIWC. In both our medical records and
social media research we plan to use tem-
poral analysis.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99994">
Although the phase 1 study was successful in
distinguishing the cohort of completed sui-
cides both from the control group cohort and
the psychiatric cohort, it was difficult to dis-
tinguish text based noise from signal with
high accuracy in our initial results. We ex-
pect that our planned follow-on study with
1000 subjects in each cohort will have much
less problem in distinguishing signal from
noise. Suicide risk prediction is a very diffi-
cult problem. We believe that studies such
as our phases 1 and 2 studies, which use su-
pervised machine learning techniques, can
uncover predictive risk factors that are not
clearly understood by the medical communi-
ty. At the same time, we also believe that
more effective suicide risk prediction sys-
tems can be built based on the integration of
machine learning methods and the expertise
of suicidologists. In particular, building an
understanding of military culture into our
methods will be important.

<abstract confidence="0.998390958333333">This paper describes the three phases of the Durkheim Project. For this project we developed a clinician&apos;s dashboard that displays output of models predicting suicide risk of veterans and active duty military personnel. During phase one, we built the clinician’s dashboard and completed a Veterans Affairs (VA) predictive risk medical records study, based on an analysis of the narrative, or free text, portions of VA medical records, In phase two, we will predict suicide risk based on opt-in social media postings by patients using social media websites, e.g., Facebook. We describe the software infrastructure that we have completed for this phase two system. During phase three we will provide a three layer intervention strategy. We discuss our methodology for the three phases, including IRBapproved protocols for the first two phases and a soon-to-be approved IRB protocol for phase three.</abstract>

Many medical conditions have been associated with an increased risk for suicide, but these conditions have generally not been included in suicide risk assessment tools. These conditions include gastrointestinal conditions, cardiopulmonary conditions, oncologic conditions, and pain conditions. Also, some research has emerged that links care processes to suicide risk. The word &amp;quot;integrated&amp;quot; emerged as a key term in our study and is also reflected in the integrated care literature (Bauer et al., 2013). Although the text on which our predictive model was based for the phase 1 medical records study was text written by a physician or other healthcare provider, our hypothesis 4 is that some of the highly predictive features learned during phase 1 will carry over to the predictive modeling of opt-in social media postings during phase 2. This text is written by the patient. However, we expect that some of the features, or concepts, will be the same due to the ability to do software based synonym matches Additionally, a physician or other healthcare worker may sometimes quote or paraphrase what a</context>

We created three matched cohorts: veterans who completed suicide, veterans who used mental health services and did not complete suicide, and veterans who did not use mental health services and did not complete suicide during the observation period (n = 70 in each group). From the clinical notes, we generated datasets of single keywords and multi-word phrases, and constructed prediction models using a supervised machinelearning algorithm based on a genetic programming framework, MOSES (Looks, 2006, 2007; Goertzel et al., 2013). MOSES can be described as a variant of a decision-tree forest, with certain genetic and maximum entropy techniques mixed in: maximum entropy to apply pressure to minimize tree size and genetic to ensure tree species diversity. In our prior research we have found that MOSES consistently outperforms standard text classification approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

These data suggest that computerized text analytics can be applied to unstructured sections of medical records to estimate the risk of suicide (Poulin et al. 2014). The resulting system could potentially allow clinicians to screen seemingly healthy patients at the primary care level, and to continuously evaluate suicide risk among psychiatric patients. 4.3 Phase 2: Predicting risk with opt-in social media postings Although data collection and analysis for phase 2 is just beginning, the software development required for this data collection and analysis was completed during phase 1.

Military personnel are also explicitly trained to overcome their fear of injury and death, typically through repeated exposure to scenarios and environments that increasingly mimic actual combat situations, which habituates them to fear and eventually replaces this fear with exhilaration and/or other positive emotions (i.e., the opponent-process). Indeed, greater exposure to combat, especially combat marked by higher levels of violence and injury, are associated with less fear of death among military personnel (Bryan and Cukrowicz, 2011; Bryan et al. 2011). Fearlessness is an essential quality of a service member; retreating from danger and life-threatening situations are generally not conducive to an effective fighting force. Yet at the same time, fear of death is a well-known protective factor for suicide, given that individuals who are afraid to die are unlikely to attempt suicide, and fearlessness is associated with more severe levels of suicide risk among military personnel relative to civilian samples, and is associated with increased severity of suicide risk among military personnel (Bryan et al., 2010).

Despite these considerable efforts, however, no evidence of effectiveness has been observed to date, resulting in considerable frustration for all involved. Although specific reasons explaining the lack of success to date are not yet known, it has been noted that most suicide prevention efforts used with military and veteran populations lack cultural relevance and do not incorporate several critical characteristics of the military culture that can create unique challenges from a suicide prevention perspective (Bryan et al., 2012). For instance, mental toughness and suppressive coping, fearlessness of death, and self-sacrifice are qualities that are valued in the military, but can serve as barriers to traditional prevention efforts. The military culture values strength, resilience, courage, and personal sacrifice when faced with adversity. Weakness is not tolerated, and service members are expected to “shake it off” or “suck it up” when experiencing problems or illness. 1 Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology: From Linguistic Signal to Clinical Reality, pages 1–6, Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 2</context>

Yet despite this “common sense” piece of knowledge, suppression and avoidance are nonetheless taught and reinforced within the military culture as a coping strategy because, in the short term after a stressful or traumatic event, suppression can actually reduce emotional distress and foster adaptation to extreme adversity (Beck et al., 2006; Bonanno 2004).

We created three matched cohorts: veterans who completed suicide, veterans who used mental health services and did not complete suicide, and veterans who did not use mental health services and did not complete suicide during the observation period (n = 70 in each group). From the clinical notes, we generated datasets of single keywords and multi-word phrases, and constructed prediction models using a supervised machinelearning algorithm based on a genetic programming framework, MOSES (Looks, 2006, 2007; Goertzel et al., 2013). MOSES can be described as a variant of a decision-tree forest, with certain genetic and maximum entropy techniques mixed in: maximum entropy to apply pressure to minimize tree size and genetic to ensure tree species diversity. In our prior research we have found that MOSES consistently outperforms standard text classification approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The primary hyperparameter that we used was the dynamic feature size. The resulting inference accuracy was at first 65% and then consistently 67% or more. This was the prediction accuracy </context>

In essence, traditional prevention approaches have conceptualized suicide in a way that conflicts with the core identity and values of military personnel and veterans. To be effective, suicide prevention efforts must be culturally-relevant and integrate these values and ideals of military personnel and veterans. 3 Related work In addition to the work related to military culture issues discussed in section 2, there are many linguistic approaches to analyzing suicide risk (Barak and Miron, 2005; Jones and Bennell, 2007; Lester, 2008a; Lester, 2008b; Lester, 2010a; Lester, 2010b; Lester et al., 2010; Lester and McSwain, 2010; Stirman and Pennebaker, 2001). In 2011, one of the Informatics for Integrating Biology &amp; the Bedside (i2b2) shared tasks was a sentiment analysis task to identify emotion in suicide notes (Combined Objective, 2011). Of this literature only Barak and Miron 2 (2005) considers online text. Most other text analysis suicide research concerns analysis of suicide notes.

A phase 2 protocol for collecting and analyzing opt-in social media postings and presenting predictions to clinicians via the Durkheim Project’s Clinicians’ dashboard has also been approved by our IRB. When the system is fully operational, a clinician will see predictive models of suicide risk for a patient constructed from the patient’s medical records and the patient’s opt-in social media postings. Subjects are being recruited via targeted efforts. Subjects will be recruited through our collaboration with Facebook (PR Newswire 2013). A Facebook pop-up window will be used to recruit people that Facebook has identified as being military personnel or veterans. 4.4 Phase 3: Intervention For phase 3, a protocol has been completed, which will soon be submitted to a final IRB. This protocol includes an unblinded, 3-cohort design, for a pilot program, which proposes to isolate serious suicide risks for individuals in real-time and to develop a prediction triage model for improved suicide intervention. Plans are to use and improve upon the linguistically-based prediction capabilities of the model developed during phase 1. The pha</context>

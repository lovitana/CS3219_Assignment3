We are trying to construct a conceptual system
that accurately represents human thoughts by
fusing of semantic networks. As semantic net-
works to fuse, we use the Japanese Wordnet
which is a thesaurus made manually based on
linguistic intuition and the knowledge acquired
automatically from the actual text stored in the
huge corpus. Such knowledge are represented
as mutual relations of the concepts of words. In
order to acquire such relations, we focus on the
case relations in sentences and calculate inclu-
sive relations of co-occurrence by using Com-
plementary Similarity Measure. As an applica-
tion and verification of the conceptual system
created, we try to simulate human associations
by using the conceptual system. As an experi-
mental result, we found the obvious difference
in generated association links between using
the semantic network of Japanese Wordnet and
using the fused semantic networks with Japa-
nese Wordnet and the acquired mutual relations.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950906976744">
In systems that support human creativity and
search, a dictionary data similar to human percep-
tion is required. Human do not think in only clas-
sification knowledge. It is insufficient for the sys-
tems which support human cognitive processes to
utilize only those existing language resources
such as thesauri that summarize word senses and
conceptual relationships of words. Because hu-
mans express their thoughts with words, it is valid
to acquire knowledge from their actual utterances
and contexts reflecting their thoughts.
In this study, we are trying to construct a con-
ceptual system that accurately represents human
thoughts by fusing of semantic networks. As se-
mantic networks to fuse, we use the following two
kinds of knowledge structure. As the first one, we
used the Japanese Wordnet (Isahara et al, 2008)
which is a thesaurus made manually based on lin-
guistic intuition. As the second one, we use the
knowledge acquired automatically from the actual
text stored in the huge corpus. Such knowledge
are represented as mutual relations of the concepts
of words. In order to acquire such relations, we
focus on the case relations in sentences such as
“case and statement,” “verb and object” and “sub-
ject and verb,” and calculate inclusive relations of
co-occurrence by using Complementary Similar-
ity Measure (CSM) (Hagita and Sawaki, 1995;
Yamamoto et al., 2005).
As an application and verification of the con-
ceptual system created, we try to simulate human
associations by using the conceptual system. Con-
cretely, we first conduct an experiment on the as-
sociation with a stimulus word, and create the as-
sociation network based on the experimental re-
sult by using our conceptual system. Then, we vis-
ualize the structure of the created association net-
works and analyze them as networks. As an ex-
perimental result, we found the obvious difference
in generated association links between using the
semantic network of Japanese Wordnet and using
the fused semantic networks with Japanese Word-
net and the acquired mutual relations.

To realize our aim described above, we create new
knowledge structure by combining the Wordnet

words which is extracted from actual text in a

2.2 CSM data
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999829375">
In this study, we utilize the knowledge based on
human utterances to construct a semantic network
as a representation of human thought. We use
Complementary Similarity Measure (CSM) to ac-
quire such knowledge from the actual text.
CSM is an asymmetry and noise-resistant
measure. Values obtained by CSM indicate rela-
tions between words, such as Hypernym-Hypo-
nym. We named data obtained in these process
“CSM data.” Comparing the Japanese Wordnet
and the CSM data, we found a lot of words and
word relations that retrieved from web corpus but
that have not been stored in the Wordnet. There-
fore, we constructed new conceptual system based
on the Japanese Wordnet that enriched by concep-
tual relationships with word pairs in CSM data.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.762012">
2.3 Experimental data based on case rela-
tion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999271075471698">
In our experiment, we use web corpus with 500
million Japanese sentences (Kawahara and Kuro-
hashi, 2006). We analyze syntactically 500 mil-
lion sentences and extract pairs of words having
co-occurrence relations in an actual sentence by
focusing on case relation, namely modified/mod-
ifier relationship. Then, we calculate CSM value
for each pairs, after we reduce some noises in the
extracted pairs by setting a threshold value.
To estimate inclusive relations between words,
we applied the method based on the CSM, which
estimates inclusive relations between two vectors
(Yamamoto et al., 2011). By using an appearance
pattern as a feature vector for each word in treat-
ing linguistic resource such as a corpus or docu-
ment collection, we have reported being able to
determine a relation between two words according
to the inclusive relation estimated by the CSM
value.
The Japanese language has case-marking parti-
cles that indicate the semantic relation between
two words in a dependency relation. Then, using
the syntactic analysis result of the web corpus, we
collected words in case (dependency) relations.
We considered the meaning of some case rela-
tions as follows.
Subject and Verb (SV)
The set of verbs that occur with certain kinds
of nouns as their subject represents the behav-
ior of the noun. To extract this relation, we use
case-marking particle &lt;ga&gt;.
For example, if “dog” occurs with “eat” and
“bear,” and “animal” occurs with “fly”, “eat”,
and “bear”, then we considers that “dog is an
animal” since the behavior of “dog” is a subset
of (or included in) the behavior of “animal.”
Verb and Object (VO)
The set of verbs that occur with certain kinds
of nouns as their object represents “how to
treat.” To extract this relation, we use case-
marking particle &lt;wo&gt;.
For example, as “criminal” often appears as an
object of the verb “catch,” we can imagine that
a criminal is a person who tend to be caught.
Noun and Sentence (NS)
For each noun N in a sentence S, we can regard
that N co-occurs with S. In other words, nouns
appearing in same sentence have a relationship
each other. They tend to be together in one spe-
cific scene in a real world. In our experiment,
we extracted such relations by gathering nouns
in a sentence with case-marking particles &lt;ga&gt;,
&lt;no&gt;, &lt;wo&gt;, and &lt;de&gt;.

Subject and Object (SO)
This co-occurrence relation is the combination
of a subject and an object for same verb.
For example, in the sentence “a human eats a
bread”, “human” and “bread” are extracted as
a combination.
As described above, we calculate the similarity
between two words based on the word co-occur-
rence by using CSM. To do this, we represent by
a binary vector experimental data which extracted
from corpora based on the case relation; the vector
corresponds to the appearance pattern of a noun.
We apply the CSM for the calculation (Yamamoto
et al. 2005). Parameters for calculating the CSM-
value correspond to the number of dimensions in
each situation.
Table 2 shows the number of extracted words,
the number of extracted words after the elimina-
tion by a threshold, its threshold (number of oc-
currence) and combination of words which has
positive CSM value, for each case relation.
In this paper, we use NS data, because it could
extract enough number of data with variety of
CSM values.

3 Comparison between Japanese Word-
net and CSM data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908975609756">
In this section, we compare Japanese Wordnet
with relation between concepts and CSM data
which consists of links between two words with
its CSM value.
As shown in Table 1, there are 286,300 synlink
entries in Japanese Wordnet. Among them,
178,178 entries (63%) are taxonomical links such
as hyponym and hypernym. Figure 1 shows the
statistics of links in Japanese Wordnet.
As shown in Table 2, we extracted 19,279,434
links which have positive CSM value from our ex-
periments. We chose top 5% of these links by set-
ting a CSM value as a threshold (926,653 links).
We use this extracted and eliminated CSM data,
i.e. word links with CSM value, for comparison
with Japanese Wordnet. The result of comparison
are shown in Table 3.
In Table 3, “Number of data” means that the
number of links (or relations) extracted automati-
cally by our system. “Percentage for all CSM data”
is the percentage of the data among all extracted
and eliminated CSM data.
“No wordid” means that one or two words re-
lated to this link of CSM data are not stored in
Japanese Wordnet. As shown in Table 3, about
63% of data contain words which are not stored in
Japanese Wordnet. It shows that CSM data which
was extracted automatically from huge corpus are
useful to improve the coverage of vocabulary
which appears in the real text.
&amp;quot;No synlink&amp;quot; means there is no relation be-
tween two synsets in Japanese Wordnet, which
correspond to two words in each CSM data. 37%
of CSM data are categorized into this class. This
category means we can add new relations (links)
into Japanese Wordnet based on the cooccurrency
between words in the huge corpus.
“Same synset” means that two words in CSM
data are treated as synonyms in the Japanese
Wordnet. &amp;quot;Hypernym,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;hyponym&amp;quot; and others,
which are not shown in Table 2, means that two

4 Creation of New Knowledge System by

<bodyText confidence="0.999892125">
In this section, we construct a conceptual system
by fusing of semantic networks, i.e. Japanese
Wordnet and set of word links extracted by CSM
based method.
As CSM can extract many relations between
words from the input data, i.e. huge corpus, we
decided to set a threshold of CSM value to elimi-
nate the number of links to fuse. We add links af-
ter elimination to Japanese Wordnet. There are
178,178 links stored in Japanese Wordnet as hy-
ponym or hypernym. Among them, relations be-
tween nouns are 151,700. As we could get
151,604 relations with the threshold of 8200, we
set the threshold 8200, and add these 151,604 re-
lations to Japanese Wordnet, which means that we
enlarge twice in size of conceptual system.

5.1 Experiments by Human Subject

<bodyText confidence="0.999773357142857">
In order to verify our new concept system, we
conducted experiments about human association
with human subjects.
If a concept structure resembles to human
knowledge structure, connecting two concepts in
the concept structure means simulating human as-
sociations from one concept to the other. Wordnet
resembles taxonomical knowledge that human
made, and CSM data (NS data) shows the
knowledge of scenes which humans picture in
mind. Combining these two different kinds of
knowledge, we are trying to create human
knowledge structure which resembles more than
other existing knowledge systems.

We presented test sheet with 11 stimulus nouns
to 51 participants (31 university students and 20
senior high school pupils), and asked them to
write down what s/he associated by each stimulus
words (Figure 2).
If we can find shorter connections of links be-
tween a stimulus word and an associated word via
our system than Japanese Wordnet, our system is
closer to knowledge structure of humans than
Wordnet, at least from the viewpoint of associa-
tions by humans.
We made network of conceptual links between
a stimulus word and associated words for visibil-
ity purpose.
For stimulus words, we use 11 nouns (music,
curry, apple, soccer, scissors, communication,
love, arm, pasta, school, vegetable), which were
mostly selected by the following conditions;
Word stored in the Japanese Wordnet.
Concrete object.
Possibility of associations.
General word, not too specific.
With 11 stimulus words and 20 high school par-
ticipants, we got a total of 1,456 words including
690 different words, such as “music: jazz, disco
and rock” and “curry: rice, carrot.”

5.2 Consideration to Simulate Associations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979164475">
Figure 3 shows the association network using Pa-
jek (Pajek—Program for large network analysis)
for stimulus word “N ude ‘arm’ ” by new concept
system. Here association network means set of
links between stimulus word and associated
words. In Figure 3, only a stimulus word and as-
sociated words which are directly connected to a
stimulus word or associated words are visualized
in order to consider the relations between associ-
ated words.
There are “N ude ‘arm’ ” and “ア—A aamu
‘arm’ ” in the Left-hand side of the figure. As both
“N ude ‘arm’ ” and “ア—A aamu ‘arm’ ” are in
the same synset of Japanese Wordnet, this associ-
ation, i.e. from “N ude ‘arm’ ” to “ア—A aamu
‘arm’ ”, is a kind of paraphrase. The associated
words shown in the middle of the figure are words
directly associated from a stimulus words, such as
“/J/JA kinniku ‘muscle’ ”. There is “V49),, ryo-
rinin ‘cook’ ” which is different direction of asso-
ciation to other associated words. This association
is caused by the polysemous feature of Japanese
word “N ude ‘arm’ ”, i.e. physical arm and ability
about a technique. The word in the right-hand side
of Figure 3, such as “3✓�&gt;lW tanpakushitsu
‘protein’ ” can be thought as associations not di-
rectly from arm but via an associated word in the
middle, e.g.,
“N ude ‘arm’ ”
--- “/J/JA kinniku ‘muscle’ ”
--- “3✓&gt;�&gt;l tanpakushitsu ‘protein’ ”
“N ude ‘arm’ ”
--- “ karada ‘body’ ”
---
“N fuku ‘clothes’ ”
In order to make detailed discussion, we have
to explore more about human association and net-
work structure we created, however, current sim-
ple network seems to reflect procedure of human
associations to a certain degree.

<bodyText confidence="0.999980166666667">
In this study, we proposed and constructed a new
conceptual system that by fusing of two different
kinds of semantic networks. As semantic net-
works to fuse, we used the Japanese Wordnet
which is a thesaurus made manually based on lin-
guistic intuition and the new type of semantic
structure which comes from the knowledge based
on human utterances that are mutual relations of
the concepts acquired automatically from the ac-
tual text.
In order to verify our new concept system, we
conducted experiments by human subjects. We
discussed the possibility of humanlike associa-
tions with our system.
We will consider tuning values assigned to
each link of network precisely based on real asso-
ciations conducted by humans by using simula-
tion technology and huge computer power.

Then, we calculate CSM value for each pairs, after we reduce some noises in the extracted pairs by setting a threshold value. To estimate inclusive relations between words, we applied the method based on the CSM, which estimates inclusive relations between two vectors (Yamamoto et al., 2011). By using an appearance pattern as a feature vector for each word in treating linguistic resource such as a c</context>

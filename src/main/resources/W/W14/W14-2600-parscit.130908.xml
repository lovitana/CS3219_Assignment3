Research in automatic Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA), as subtasks of Affective Computing
and Natural Language Processing (NLP), has flourished in the past years. The growth in interest in these
tasks was motivated by the birth and rapid expansion of the Social Web that made it possible for people
all over the world to share, comment or consult content on any given topic. In this context, opinions,
sentiments and emotions expressed in Social Media texts have been shown to have a high influence
on the social and economic behavior worldwide. SSA systems are highly relevant to many real-world
applications (e.g. marketing, eGovernance, business intelligence, social analysis) and also to many tasks
in Natural Language Processing (NLP) - information extraction, question answering, textual entailment,
to name just a few. The importance of this field has been proven by the high number of approaches
proposed in research in the past decade, as well as by the interest that it raised from other disciplines
(Economics, Sociology, Psychology) and the applications that were created using its technology.
Despite the large interest shown by the research community and the development of a set of
benchmarking resources and methods to tackle sentiment analysis, SSA remains far from being a
solved issue. While systems working for English on customer reviews obtain good results in sentiment
classification, systems working for other languages or on Social Media texts are still struggling to surpass
the baseline. As such, it is necessary to continue the sentiment analysis community’s efforts to develop
new resources and methods, as well as to bring knowledge and experience from other disciplines that
have been dealing with affect phenomena (e.g. Psychology, Sociology, etc.).
The aim of the 5th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media
Analysis (WASSA 2014) was to continue the line of the previous editions, bringing together researchers
in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working
on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text. Starting with 2013, WASSA has extended its
scope and focus to Social Media phenomena and the impact of affect-related phenomena in this context.
WASSA 2014 was organized in conjunction to the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics (ACL 2014), on June 27, 2014, in Baltimore, Maryland, United States of
America.
For this year’s edition of WASSA, we received a total of 40 submissions, from universities and research
centers all over the world, out of which 8 were accepted as long and another 14 as short papers. Each
paper has been thoroughly reviewed by at least 2 members of the Program Committee. The accepted
papers were all highly assessed by the reviewers, the best paper receiving an average punctuation
(computed as an average of all criteria used to assess the papers) of 4.5 out of 5.
The main topics of the accepted papers are related to computational and cognitive modelling of affect,
especially in Social Media - the creation and evaluation of resources for subjectivity, sentiment and
emotion resources for Twitter mining, the development of semantic analysis-based methods for sentiment
detection, argumentation and inference analysis, cross-lingual and multilingual resource creation and use,
the detection of irony and sarcasm.
The invited talks reflected the multimodal nature of affect expressions and the strong connection between
human affect-sensing mechanisms. At the same time, the talks drew our attention on the possible misuses
of social media platforms that can bias opinion analysis, both to humans, as well as automatic systems.
Finally, the talk by the organizers described the difficulties involved in porting research to the real-life
application scenario.
This year’s edition has again shown that the topics put forward to discussion by WASSA are of high
interest to the research community and that the papers chosen to be debated in this forum bring an
iii
important development to the SSA research area.
We would like to thank the ACL 2014 Organizers for the help and support at the different stages of the
workshop organization process. We are also especially grateful to the Program Committee members and
the external reviewers for the time and effort spent assessing the papers. We would like to extend our
thanks to our invited speakers – Dr. Saif Mohammad and Dr. Myle Ott - for accepting to deliver the
keynote talks.
Secondly, we would like to express our gratitude for the official endorsement we received from SIGNLL,
the ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning, and SIGSEM, ACL’s Special Interest
Group on Computational Semantics.
We would like to express our gratitude to Yaniv Steiner, who created the WASSA logo and to the
entire Europe Media Monitor team at the European Commission Joint Research Centre, for the technical
support they provided.

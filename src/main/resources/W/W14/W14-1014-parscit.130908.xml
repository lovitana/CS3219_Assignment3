Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.983559135135135">
Linguistic resources available in the pub-
lic domain, such as lemmatisers, part-of-
speech taggers and parsers can be used
for the development of MT systems: as
separate processing modules or as anno-
tation tools for the training corpus. For
SMT this annotation is used for training
factored models, and for the rule-based
systems linguistically annotated corpus is
the basis for creating analysis, generation
and transfer dictionaries from corpora.
However, the annotation in many cases is
insufficient for rule-based MT, especially
for the generation tasks. In this paper we
analyze a specific case when the part-of-
speech tagger does not provide infor-
mation about de/het gender of Dutch
nouns that is needed for our rule-based
MT systems translating into Dutch. We
show that this information can be derived
from large annotated monolingual corpo-
ra using a set of context-checking rules
on the basis of co-occurrence of nouns
and determiners in certain morphosyntac-
tic configurations. As not all contexts are
sufficient for disambiguation, we evalu-
ate the coverage and the accuracy of our
method for different frequency thresholds

possible generalization of our method,
and using it to automatically derive other
types of linguistic information needed for
rule-based MT: syntactic subcategoriza-
tion frames, feature agreement rules and
contextually appropriate collocates.

<bodyText confidence="0.99979625">
This paper evaluates a methodology for deriving
gender classification of nouns based on their con-
textual features and light-weight linguistic anno-
tation of a corpus. We approach the problem as
reconstructing an enriched set of linguistic fea-
tures for RBMT generation lexicon from com-
bining implicit information available in corpora
with a set of general linguistic principles imple-
mented as a small set of simple hand-crafted con-
textual rules.
These rules are specified as configurations of
part-of-speech codes and operate over configura-
tions of part-of-speech codes designed to capture
certain disambiguating linguistic constructions.
Theoretically, the rules can be made highly-
accurate if the list of disambiguating construc-
tions is exhaustive, but there is a well-known
trade-off between Precision, Recall and the de-
velopment effort for hand-crafted sets of rules.
Additional factors to be taken into account are
the quality and size of the annotated corpus. In
our experiment we take a practical approach, us-
ing a minimal set of contextual rules that cover
most typical constructions.

2 Linguistic aspects of gender disam-
biguation task for Dutch nouns
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999840000000001">
Predicting gender of Dutch nouns from their
context is a simple and clearly defined contextual
disambiguation task, and we can evaluate three
aspects of the performance of our method: (a)
what coverage and accuracy can be achieved on
this task compared to the gold standard; (b) how
do the coverage and accuracy change in different
frequency thresholds; (c) what is the proportion
of contexts which can be used for disambiguation
in different frequency thresholds (since some
contexts will not disambiguate the features of
interest).
Nouns in Dutch belong to one of the two gen-
der classes which determine the choice of the
definite articles (used with singular nouns) and
other determiners: neuter nouns take determiners
het, dat, dit, ons, and nouns with the common
gender, which historically is the merged mascu-
line and feminine, take de, die, deze, onze. Nouns
can only be disambiguated when used as singular
and take a definite determiner, so not all contexts
in corpus which contain nouns can be useful for
disambiguation.
The information about het/de classification for
nouns is a non-interpretable (in terms of the gen-
erative grammar) system-internal morphological
feature: it characterises only combinatorial prop-
erties of nouns, but does not directly influence
their syntactic functions in a structure of a sen-
tence or their semantic interpretation (unlike the
part-of-speech/Noun category, morphological
case and number). Therefore, this feature is much
more useful for text generation than for analysis,
and belongs to the family of other similar sys-
tem-internal features, like inflection classes, sub-
categorisation frames, lexical functions (colloca-
tional restrictions), etc. Interestingly, this feature
normally operates in the local context of several
words within a limited number of possible part-
of-speech sequences.
For machine translation task this information
needs to be supplied by the target language gen-
eration rules, or by the target language model,
since it is normally not present in the source text,
and cannot be derived from application of trans-
fer rules or the translation model.
There are several wide-coverage part-of-
speech taggers and lemmatisers for Dutch in the
public domain (open source and/or freely availa-
ble), such as Dutch parameter files for the Tree-
Tagger (Schmid, 1994), TiMBL / Frog tagger /
lemmatiser / dependency parser (Van den Bosch
et al., 2007), Alpino system (Bouma et al., 2001).
Some of them provide only plain high-level an-
notation of part-of-speech codes, without gender
information for nouns. However, some do gener-
ate enriched part-of-speech codes for nouns spec-
ifying their gender. Because of this we can
benchmark our methodology using this enriched
information as gold-standard and calculate Preci-
sion in addition to coverage.

<bodyText confidence="0.999962666666667">
In our experiment TiMBL / Frog was used to
automatically annotate a 60-million-word section
of the balanced Dutch SoNaR corpus (Oostdijk et
al., 2008).
TiMBL/Frog provides gold-standard diction-
ary-based information about these classes for
identified lemmas. For the prediction task we
ignored the gold-standard gender class infor-
mation, and used only the generic part-of-speech
information and the number category for nouns.
In the evaluation stage, we compared these au-
tomatically predicted gender classes with the
gold-standard classes.
Prediction of the de/het classes was performed
by a set of regular expressions, which cover most
typical contexts, where these determiners are
distinguished. If both types of determiners were
found in different contexts for the same noun,
then the class that has the majority of contexts
was assigned. Regular expressions covered sim-
ple contexts, e.g.: Det (Adj)? Noun:

- Contexts, %/100: the proportion of con-

For instance, the first row shows the figures
when no frequency cut-off is applied, e.g.: there
were 157066 types labeled as Nouns in our sec-
tion of SoNaR corpus, of which 74505 Nouns
were found in a specific context with a definite
determiner that allowed to disambiguate gender.
Out of these, 2417 types (3.2%) were disambigu-
ated wrongly for different reasons, 72088 types
(96.8%) were disambiguated correctly. However,
there still remain 84978 noun types (or 54.1% of
the total number of 157066 in the gold standard),
which were not disambiguated. In total, in the
corpus 75.2% of contexts were useful for de/het
disambiguation (contained a definite determiner
in the immediate left context, or in a one-word-
apart position, being separated by an adjective).
The second row in Table 1 presents the subset
of 70006 noun types out of the results presented
in the first row for 157066 noun types, i.e., the
results only for nouns with frequency more than
one; the third row – for noun types with frequen-
cies more than two, etc. The intuition is that pre-
diction for more frequent nouns should be more
accurate since more token contexts become
available for disambiguation of a specific noun
type.

1. The Precision even for simple contextual
disambiguation rules is surprisingly
high: 96.8% for nouns where the
prediction was possible. This indicates
that simple disambiguation patterns are
sufficiently frequent to outweigh more
complex patterns which were not
covered by the rule and may have lead to
errors.

gold-standard gender class, since no
disambiguation context was found for
these nouns in corpus. However, since
more frequent nouns have more chances
of occurring in a disambiguation context,
mostly low frequent nouns are missed: if
we exclude nouns which occurred only
once, the procedure misses 37% of
nouns; in frequency threshold Frq&gt; 2 it
misses even less – 28%, etc.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9723925">
3. Error rate (proportion of wrongly
disambiguated nouns) is relatively stable
(3.2% on the whole data set), and does
not depend too much on the frequency of
nouns: it declines very slowly when the
frequency increases (much slower that
the coverage of the certain threshold).
4. The proportion of contexts which are
useful for disambiguation declines
slowly with the increase in frequency
threshold, but stabilises around 40% for
highly frequent nouns. Interestingly,
when the proportion of such contexts
goes down, the error rate stays the same.

<bodyText confidence="0.999922142857143">
In general, the results indicate that for practical
purposes of rule-based MT development – a suf-
ficiently large list of gender-disambiguated
Dutch nouns (around 75000) can be successfully
collected from a medium-size corpus (60MW)
with very high Precision (96.8%). The method
will provide gender disambiguation information
for around 46% of all nouns found in the corpus;
and for higher frequency threshold the percent-
age of gender-disambiguated nouns goes up rap-
idly, flattening at around 90% for Frq&gt;10. This
performance reaches the quality standards for
creating wide-coverage generation dictionaries
for rule-based MT.

tion of the methodology
The task of predicting gender classes for nouns
gives indication how other types of similar mor-
phosyntactic resources and representations can
be developed and enhanced.
Our methodology is part of a larger develop-
ment infrastructure for creating a corpus-based
development environment for industry-standard
rule-based MT systems enhanced with statistical
tools and data. The infrastructure uses large
monolingual corpora annotated by openly availa-
ble part-of-speech taggers and lemmatisers, and
semi-automatically derives a set of morphologi-
cal and syntactic patterns for the lexical items
found there. These patterns represent advanced
linguistic features for the lexicon, such as classi-
fication by inflectional morphological paradigms,
derivational classes (e.g., gender for nouns), lex-
ical valencies (subcategorisation and case
frames), attachment preferences and lexical col-
locates.
For individual lexical items these patterns do
not need to be fully specified from the training
corpus: missing forms are reconstructed on the
basis of evidence from other lexemes that fit the
same pattern, so the system recognises and gen-
erates correct output also for unseen forms.
In the context of our hybrid MT development
infrastructure this approach particularly targets
creation of linguistically-rich resources that gen-
erate correct target language forms and phrases.
The generation aspect is usually not covered by
the annotation tools available in the public do-
main, so parsers, part-of-speech taggers and
lemmatisers usually work only in the direction of
analysis, and do not deal with generation).
In a more general context the described infra-
structure develops lexical and morphosyntactic
resources in a systematic way, so they can be
used in a wider range of applications and tasks. It
also attempts to bridge the gap between rule-
based and statistical techniques in MT by creat-
ing rich and highly accurate linguistic representa-
tions using corpus-based statistical techniques
and integrating them within processing models
for hybrid MT architecture.
The central principle of the proposed infra-
structure is that advanced morphosyntactic fea-
tures and representations are derived from corpo-
ra annotated with light-weight linguistic features.
The interpretation of this principle is that the
tools like part-of-speech taggers and lemmatisers
implement a unidirectional functional perspec-
tive on the morphosyntactic system, which only
partially covers the network of linguistic rela-
tions involved in the analysis and generation as-
pects of the language. Rule-based MT applica-
tion instead need to rely on the alternative rela-
tional perspective of morphosyntactic representa-
tions. Our infrastructure aims at reconstructing
this perspective by combining large corpora and
unidirectional annotation tools. It derives a range
of generation-oriented morphosyntactic features
and representations using local context and
standard analysis-oriented annotation features in
corpora.
The main motivation is that from the point of
view of rule-based MT there is a certain imbal-
ance between resources for analysis and annota-
</bodyText>

tion of texts on the one hand, and resources for
language generation on the other hand. Text an-
notation resources, such as part-of-speech tag-
gers, lemmatisers, parsers, chunkers – have a
longer history of research and development, e.g.,
(Greene and Rubin, 1971), have created common
standards and are more widely available in the
public domain, e.g., (Schmid, 1994; Brants,
2000). In their existing form they can be applied
to new languages and are more widely used in
practical applications. On the other hand, genera-
tion-oriented tools are much less accessible, of-
ten propitiatory, and lack common standards and
shared frameworks for integration of new lan-
guages. The predominant unidirectional text-
annotation focus might be explained by a historic
reason that text annotation was seen as an inter-
esting computational problem with a clearly de-
fined evaluation procedure, which was much
harder to develop for the generation tasks.
The idea behind the infrastructure is that if at
least some unidirectional annotation tools are
available for a certain language, the relational
morphosyntactic resources can be automatically
developed from large annotated corpora. This
will include automatic acquisition of inflectional
paradigms for lexical items, attachment prefer-
ence detection, automatic acquisition of lexical
functions. Our infrastructure aims at developing
standards and building openly available re-
sources for a number of languages, including
under-resourced languages, such as Portuguese,
Russian and Ukrainian, in order to carry out the
following morphosyntacitc tasks:

The first two functions are performed on internal
features of a word, while the other five require
contextual input in addition. The described func-
tionality has applications for rule-based MT and
Natural Language Generation, which could both
benefit from shared standards and the infrastruc-
ture of relation-oriented linguistic resources.

<abstract confidence="0.999722">Linguistic resources available in the public domain, such as lemmatisers, part-ofspeech taggers and parsers can be used for the development of MT systems: as separate processing modules or as annotation tools for the training corpus. For SMT this annotation is used for training factored models, and for the rule-based systems linguistically annotated corpus is the basis for creating analysis, generation and transfer dictionaries from corpora. However, the annotation in many cases is insufficient for rule-based MT, especially for the generation tasks. In this paper we analyze a specific case when the part-ofspeech tagger does not provide information about de/het gender of Dutch nouns that is needed for our rule-based MT systems translating into Dutch. We show that this information can be derived from large annotated monolingual corpora using a set of context-checking rules on the basis of co-occurrence of nouns and determiners in certain morphosyntactic configurations. As not all contexts are sufficient for disambiguation, we evaluate the coverage and the accuracy of our method for different frequency thresholds © 2014 European Association for Computational Linguistics. in the news corpora. Further we discuss possible generalization of our method, and using it to automatically derive other types of linguistic information needed for rule-based MT: syntactic subcategorization frames, feature agreement rules and contextually appropriate collocates.</abstract>

For machine translation task this information needs to be supplied by the target language generation rules, or by the target language model, since it is normally not present in the source text, and cannot be derived from application of transfer rules or the translation model. There are several wide-coverage part-ofspeech taggers and lemmatisers for Dutch in the public domain (open source and/or freely available), such as Dutch parameter files for the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), TiMBL / Frog tagger / lemmatiser / dependency parser (Van den Bosch et al., 2007), Alpino system (Bouma et al., 2001). Some of them provide only plain high-level annotation of part-of-speech codes, without gender information for nouns. However, some do generate enriched part-of-speech codes for nouns specifying their gender. Because of this we can benchmark our methodology using this enriched information as gold-standard and calculate Precision in addition to coverage. 3 Set-up of the experiment In our experiment TiMBL / Frog was used to automatically annotate a 60-million-word section of th</context>

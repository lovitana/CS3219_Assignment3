<bodyText confidence="0.999935521739131">
Vernacular regions such as central Ohio
are popularly used in everyday language;
but their vague and indeterministic bound-
aries affect the clarity of communicating
them over the geographic space. This pa-
per introduced a context-based natural
language processing approach to retrieve
geographic entities. Geographic entities
extracted from news articles were used as
location-based behavioral samples to map
out the vague region of central Ohio. Par-
ticularly, part of speech tagging and parse
tree generation were employed to filter out
candidate entities from English sentences.
Propositional logic of context (PLC) was
introduced and adapted to build the con-
textual model for deciding the member-
ship of named entities. Results were auto-
matically generated and visualized in GIS
using both symbol and density mapping.
Final maps were consistent with our intu-
ition and common sense knowledge of the
vague region.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999788893617022">
Central Ohio is commonly used vernacular term
to refer to an approximate area around the city of
Columbus in Ohio. Although it may be effortless
for humans to tell the relative location of this re-
gion, it remains challenging for computers to au-
tomatically locate this region by harvesting and
analyzing online data such as news articles. Com-
puters that are capable of automatically delineat-
ing such vague regions may be of potential use to
social science researchers for understanding other
concepts that may not be as obvious such as cul-
tural regions, the Muslim world.
In the study of vague regions, previous studies
introduced a behavioral method to map out down-
town Santa Barbara based on human survey data
(Montello, Goodchild, Gottsegen, &amp; Fohl, 2003).
Their approach collected hand-drawn point-based
locations and plotted them on the map of the city.
Such data collection process may be very costly
compared to computer-based automated ap-
proach. By comparison, natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) techniques such as part of speech
tagging and parse tree generation provide power-
ful linguistic analysis tools that can help quickly
retrieve data from a large number of corpus data
(Jurafsky, Martin, Kehler, Vander Linden, &amp;
Ward, 2000). However, these NLP techniques
have yet been widely used to extract geographic
entities for visualizing vague regions like central
Ohio.
On the other hand, linguistic contexts of named
entities are important for deciding its relevancy to
the underlying vague regions. For instance, for a
place to be part of central Ohio, it must be in the
context of Ohio as a precondition. Propositional
logic of context (PLC) is a logic model in the field
of artificial intelligence for formalizing contexts
into propositional calculus (BuvaE &amp; Mason,
1993). Based on PLC, an arbitrary predicate cal-
culus can be evaluated according to selected con-
texts.
In this paper, central Ohio is chosen as the ex-
perimental area to experiment the context-based
natural language approach for visualizing vague
regions. News articles are used and analyzed on
three contextual levels: document, paragraph and
sentence. Results are visualized in GIS.

<bodyText confidence="0.999776555555556">
News articles are extracted from LexisNexis, a
comprehensive database of both national and lo-
cal news (Smith, Ellenberg, Bell, &amp; Rubin, 2008).
All articles are retrieved based on caseless key-
word match for relevancy. The only keyword used
is central Ohio and only news articles that contain
this exact phrase are retrieved. As a result, 3281
different articles are collected which cover central
Ohio news from the year 1990 to the year 2013.

Part of speech tagging and parse tree generation
are used to automatically extract geographic
named entities from news articles in this paper.
Part of speech (POS) tagging is the process of de-
ciding the functions of words such as nouns or
verbs. Parse tree generation is based on POS tag-
ging results. It aims to generate hierarchical rep-
resentations of sentences for semantic understand-
ing (Jurafsky et al., 2000). Noun phrases in the
parse tree are often useful indicators to named en-
tities in geolinguistic analysis (Chen et al., 2013).

2.1 Part of speech tagging
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999782285714286">
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging assigns a POS tag
to each token in a sentence. A token can be either
a word or a punctuation. The single best POS tag
assigned to a token depends on the function of the
word, the tag set, and POS tagging algorithm
(Jurafsky et al., 2000). Contemporary POS tag-
gers can reach an average accuracy of above 97%
on tokens (Manning, 2011).
The part of speech tagger we use is Stanford
NLP tagger with english-caseless-left3words-
distsim tagger model. This tagger model is trained
with WSJ sections 0-18 and extra parser training
data using the left3words architecture. It includes
word shape and distributional similarity features
for training the tagger (Gimpel et al., 2010). The
results are represented using Penn Treebank tags
and the average parsing accuracy is above 97% on
sentences in news. Box 1 is the tagged sentence
from one article with POS tags appended after the
slash in uppercase letters. For a complete list, one
may refer to Penn Treebank tag sets.

2.2 Parsing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999843235294118">
Stanford parsers are used to produce the parse tree
from which noun phrases, named entity candi-
dates, can be extracted (De Marneffe,
MacCartney, &amp; Manning, 2006) . Fig.1 shows the
result of parsing the tagged sentence in Box 1. It
is observed that only noun phrases (NP) at the
lowest level of the tree are useful for extracting
named entities. Noun phrases at other levels con-
tain auxiliary structures such as prepositions often
do not suggest named entities.
In Fig.1, NPs in dashed rectangles are candi-
date entities that do not match any records in our
Ohio database. When looking up the database for
a match, determinants like the are skipped as well
as entity type terms like city and county. To find
the location of a matched entity, a SQL query is
used to return the latitude and longitude pair.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999797">
As previously discussed, candidate named entities
are primarily noun phrases extracted at the root
level of a parse tree. However, not all such entities
should be considered as part of central Ohio. To
determine the membership, we may define fol-
lowing logic heuristics: if (1) the name of an entity
is in the same text segment as the phrase central
Ohio and (2) the entity is an Ohio place, then the
entity is of greater likelihood of being a central
Ohio place than otherwise. Here, Ohio and central

Ohio are linguistic contexts for discriminating
central Ohio entities.
To formalize the contexts of analysis, we intro-
duce propositional logic of context (PLC) (BuvaE
&amp; Mason, 1993). Here, we only adapt its basic
form as it already suffice the needs of our analysis.
For detailed information of PLC, one may read the
original paper from BuvaE (BuvaE &amp; Mason,
1993). The minimum PLC definition is below:
x: subject
p: preposition about the subject
c: context
c1c2: logic AND, intersection of two contexts
c1c2: logic OR, union of two contexts
ist(c, p): the proposition p is true in context c.

3.2 PLC-based matching and counting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.954997148148148">
Based on the PLC definition, we count the men-
tions of named entities in all news articles.
Here, we define the following PLC notations for
our analysis:
p: the preposition that x is a central Ohio city
c1: the context of Ohio
c2: the context of central Ohio
c3: the context of not-central Ohio
Ohio context is defined according to records in
geonames database. If an entity name is in the da-
tabase, it is said to be in the Ohio context. Central
Ohio context is defined as the text segment con-
taining both the entity name and the phrase central
Ohio. Not-central Ohio context is defined as the
text segment with the following terms in it:
north(ern) Ohio, northeast(ern) Ohio, east(ern)
Ohio, southeast(ern) Ohio, south(ern) Ohio,
southwest(ern) Ohio, west(ern) Ohio, and north-
west(ern) Ohio. Based on our observation, these
eight azimuth phrases are found to be good indi-
cators of places that are obviously not in central
Ohio.
Accordingly, three types of entity counts are
also developed.
(1)Positive count (E): the total number of occur-
rences of the name of an entity E in the context
c1c2.

<listItem confidence="0.976896166666667">

(3) Negative count (E): the total number of occur-
rences of the name of an entity E in the context

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.978197">
3.3 Count and normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94371276">
We calculate the membership of an entity to the
concept central Ohio using following counting
and normalization rules. We define three variables
to count entity occurrences in different contexts:
Cpos : positive count of the entity E.
Cneg : negative count of the entity E.
Cneu : neutral count of the entity E.
IF ist(c1c2, p), Cpos++.
IF ist(c1c3, p), Cneg++.
IF ist(c1c2c3, p), Cneu++.
Based on observations, big cities like Colum-
bus are mentioned more frequently than other
smaller places in term of both Cpos and Cneg. As
it is the difference between Cpos and Cnegthat de-
termines the sign of the membership, we decide to
use Cneu as the normalization denominator for
calculating the membership.
Membership r of a place is calculated using
Equation 1. It is a real value between -1 and 1. All
places are classified by the sign of the member-
ship as either central Ohio or not-central Ohio
place with the magnitude of the value being the
strength of the membership. 1 means definitely a
central Ohio place and -1 means definitely not a
central Ohio place.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.992148">
r = r (Cpos C — Cneg)⁄Cneu , if Cneu &gt; 0 Equation 1
1 , otherwise
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999677875">
As Cneu is in the denominator, it must not be
zero. Given observations, entities with Cneu being
zero are primarily entities with less than 3 total
mentions. These entities take up 3.9% of all ex-
tracted entities. Therefore, we decide to exclude
them from analysis as they are of a small percent-
age and are not expected to affect the overall re-
sults.

4.1 Graduated symbol maps
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996252083333333">
Graduated symbol map is a type of map that uses
symbols of different sizes to represent geographic
entities (Thrall, 1999). The symbol we choose is
circle. The radius of the circle is decided by the
attribute value associated with each entity. The
map is configured as follows:
(1)The size of each point is proportioned to the
membership of the underlying named entity
with size 4 and 24 representing the minimum
and maximum membership respectively.
(2)Symbols are classified into 10 classes based on
equal interval classification method.

<bodyText confidence="0.999468941176471">
There is one exception of using the member-
ship for making the graduated symbol map. On
the article level, all entity counts are added to
CP𝑜S, and therefore there are no negative or neu-
tral counts. To make a map on the article level, we
only use the positive count as the surrogate to the
membership value.
Graduated symbol maps on three analytical
levels are shown in Fig. 2. Results on the sentence
level and paragraph levels conforms better to our
intuition and common sense knowledge than on
the article level. This is because results on the ar-
ticle level do not consider the contexts of c1 and c2
discussed in section 4.2. Results from the sentence
and paragraph levels are very similar with the
membership on the paragraph level being slightly
more visually significant.

4.2 Kernel density map
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948555555555">
Results produced by graduated symbol maps are
not continuous. Kernel density mapping is a GIS
mapping technique that generates a continuous
surface based on the locations of the entities and
their attribute values (Elgammal, Duraiswami,
Harwood, &amp; Davis, 2002). To create kernel den-
sity maps, a search radius need be defined. All
data points within this radius will be used to inter-
polate a density area using a quadratic kernel
function described in Silverman (p. 76, equation
4.5) (Silverman, 1986).
The kernel density tool in ArcGIS is used to
create the density map. In ArcGIS, the search ra-
dius is defined as a percentage of the area’s mini-
mum extent width. We experiment on choosing
1/10, 1/5, 1/20 of the area’s minimum extent
width as the radius to generate the surface and find
1/10 of the width most appropriate to generate a
balanced looking map.
A kernel density map of central Ohio visual-
izes its estimated central location and extending
trend over the space of Ohio. Fig. 3 is a kernel
density result based on the paragraph level. It
shows that the concept of central Ohio generated
through automated approach conforms to our
common sense knowledge of the assumptive loca-
tion of the vague region.

<bodyText confidence="0.999951621621622">
Vague geographic regions are important part of
the entire geographic space; however they are dif-
ficult to be located and delineated on a map. Geo-
graphic questions like Where is central Ohio? re-
mains a challenge to computers because comput-
ers are not automatically given the knowledge of
either central or Ohio as humans do.
This paper introduced a context-based ap-
proach to extract geographic entities from news
articles. Propositional logic of context was
adapted to contextualize the reasoning process.
Three types of context have been defined: Ohio,
central Ohio, not-central Ohio, which corre-
sponded to Ohio places, central Ohio places and
not-central Ohio places, respectively.
Analysis was conducted on three contextual
levels: article, paragraph and sentence. Visuali-
zation results showed that context was of signifi-
cant importance to deciding the membership of a
place to central Ohio. Without defining the con-
text (e.g. results on the article level in Fig. 2), vis-
ualization results were largely incorrect compared
with common sense knowledge.
Natural language processing (NLP) techniques
such as part of speech tagging and parse tree gen-
eration were shown to be effective for extracting
geographic information. Noun phrases could
serve as good candidates to place names. For fu-
ture research, we suggest studies on experiment-
ing with different regional concepts using pro-
posed approach. It may also be useful to experi-
ment with methods that can quickly generate sam-
ples other than the tree parsing method used in this
paper. Despite the possibility of generating more
coarse results, noisier method may be more scala-
ble for building practical applications with scaled
live data.

Results from the sentence and paragraph levels are very similar with the membership on the paragraph level being slightly more visually significant. Figure 2. Graduated symbol map of central Ohio 4.2 Kernel density map Results produced by graduated symbol maps are not continuous. Kernel density mapping is a GIS mapping technique that generates a continuous surface based on the locations of the entities and their attribute values (Elgammal, Duraiswami, Harwood, &amp; Davis, 2002). To create kernel density maps, a search radius need be defined. All data points within this radius will be used to interpolate a density area using a quadratic kernel function described in Silverman (p. 76, equation 4.5) (Silverman, 1986). The kernel density tool in ArcGIS is used to create the density map. In ArcGIS, the search radius is defined as a percentage of the area’s minimum extent width. We experiment on choosing 1/10, 1/5, 1/20 of the area’s minimum extent width as the radius to generate the surface and find 1/10 of the width most appropriate to generate a balanced looking map.

Although it may be effortless for humans to tell the relative location of this region, it remains challenging for computers to automatically locate this region by harvesting and analyzing online data such as news articles. Computers that are capable of automatically delineating such vague regions may be of potential use to social science researchers for understanding other concepts that may not be as obvious such as cultural regions, the Muslim world. In the study of vague regions, previous studies introduced a behavioral method to map out downtown Santa Barbara based on human survey data (Montello, Goodchild, Gottsegen, &amp; Fohl, 2003). Their approach collected hand-drawn point-based locations and plotted them on the map of the city. Such data collection process may be very costly compared to computer-based automated approach. By comparison, natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as part of speech tagging and parse tree generation provide powerful linguistic analysis tools that can help quickly retrieve data from a large number of corpus data (Jurafsky, Martin, Kehler, Vander Linden, &amp; Ward, 2000). However, these NLP techniques have yet been widely used to extract geographic entities for visualizing vague region</context>

The symbol we choose is circle. The radius of the circle is decided by the attribute value associated with each entity. The map is configured as follows: (1)The size of each point is proportioned to the membership of the underlying named entity with size 4 and 24 representing the minimum and maximum membership respectively. (2)Symbols are classified into 10 classes based on equal interval classification method. 10 There is one exception of using the membership for making the graduated symbol map.

These proceedings contain the papers presented at the 5th Workshop on Language Analysis in Social
Media (LASM 2014). The workshop is held in Gothenburg, Sweden, on April 26–30, 2014, and hosted
in conjunction with the 14th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational
Linguistics.
Over the past few years, online social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Flickr, MySpace,
LinkedIn, Metacafe, Vimeo, etc.) have revolutionized the way we communicate with individuals, groups
and communities, and altered everyday practices. The unprecedented volume and variety of user-
generated content as well as the user interaction network constitute new opportunities for understanding
social behavior and building socially-intelligent systems.
This 5th workshop attracted several submissions from around the world. Each paper was assigned to
four reviewers. For the final workshop program, and for inclusion in these proceedings, nine regular
papers were selected. The workshop program features two keynote presentations: one by Kalina
Bontcheva, Senior Researcher in the Natural Language Processing Group, Department of Computer
Science, University of Sheffield, and one on Industrial perspectives presented by NLP Technologies,
Montreal Canada, on social media monitoring and innovative tools.
One of the goals of LASM 2014 was to reflect a wide range of different research efforts and results
of language analysis with implications for fields such as natural language processing, computational
linguistics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. We invited original and unpublished research papers
on all topics related to the analysis of language on social media, including the following topics:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9999755">
• What are people talking about on social media?
• How are they expressing themselves?
• Why do they scribe?
• Natural language processing techniques for social media analysis
• How do language and social network properties interact?
• Semantic Web / Ontologies / Domain models to aid in social data understanding
• Characterizing Participants via Linguistic Analysis
• Language, Social Media and Human Behavior
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.672754">
This workshop would not have been possible without the hard work of many people. We would like to
thank all Program Committee members and external reviewers for their effort in providing high-quality
reviews in a timely manner. We thank all the authors who submitted their papers, as well as the authors
whose papers were selected, for their help with preparing the final copy. We are in debt to the EACL
2014 Workshop co-Chairs. We would also like to thank our industry partners for their support and for
making LASM 2014 a successful workshop; NLP Technologies, Microsoft Research and IBM Almaden.

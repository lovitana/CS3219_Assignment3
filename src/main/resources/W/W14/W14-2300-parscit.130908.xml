Characteristic to all areas of human activity (from poetic to ordinary to scientific) and, thus, to all types
of discourse, metaphor becomes an important problem for natural language processing. Its ubiquity in
language has been established in a number of corpus studies and the role it plays in human reasoning
has been confirmed in psychological experiments. This makes metaphor an important research area for
computational and cognitive linguistics, and its automatic identification and interpretation indispensable
for any semantics-oriented NLP application.
The work on metaphor in NLP and AI started in the 1980s, providing us with a wealth of ideas on the
structure and mechanisms of the phenomenon. The last decade witnessed a technological leap in natural
language computation, whereby manually crafted rules gradually give way to more robust corpus-based
statistical methods. This is also the case for metaphor research. In the recent years, the problem of
metaphor modeling has been steadily gaining interest within the NLP community, with a growing number
of approaches exploiting statistical techniques. Compared to more traditional approaches based on hand-
coded knowledge, these more recent methods tend to have a wider coverage, as well as be more efficient,
accurate and robust. However, even the statistical metaphor processing approaches so far often focused
on a limited domain or a subset of phenomena. At the same time, recent work on computational lexical
semantics and lexical acquisition techniques, as well as a wide range of NLP methods applying machine
learning to open-domain semantic tasks, open many new avenues for creation of large-scale robust tools
for recognition and interpretation of metaphor.
This year’s workshop is the second workshop focused on modeling of metaphor using NLP techniques,
following the first workshop held at NAACL 2013. The 2013 workshop turned out to be a popular
event, with 28 registered participants and more people in attendance. In 2013, accepted papers dealt
with metaphor annotation, features for metaphor identification, and with generalization of the techniques
across languages. These themes continue to be represented in this year’s workshop, along with
additional foci on interpretation, applications, and relationships with related phenomena. We received
11 submissions and accepted 7, based on detailed and careful reviews by members of the Program
Committee.
Two of the accepted papers deal with aspects of interpretation, such as the affect carried by the
metaphor (Strzalkowski et al) and the underlying plausible reasoning mechanisms such as abduction
(Ovchinnikova et al). Another theme is the application of metaphor to support creative exploration of
language and ideas through a dedicated web service (Veale). Additional papers address in depth issues
that are known to bear on the phenomenon of metaphor, such as abstractness and topicality. Dunn
analyzes different kinds of abstractness and their relation to metaphoricity. Beigman Klebanov et al
and Schulder and Hovy address the relationship between metaphor and topic of discussion. At the
corpus level, Beigman Klebanov et al show that texts sharing a topic also share a substantial proportion
of metaphors. At the level of a single text, Schulder and Hovy show that off-topic words are good
candidates for metaphoricity. While previous studies and annotation efforts concentrated mostly on well-
edited texts, Jang et al address social media, as well as the gap between metaphor annotations provided
by trained annotators and by laypeople on a crowdsourcing website.
Complementing this diverse technical program, the workshop also features two invited talks. Dr. Brad
Pasanek, an Assistant Professor in the English department at the University of Virginia, begins the talks
at this year’s workshop. Dr. Pasanek has collected, curated and analyzed a large collection of metaphors
of mind used in 18th century British poetry; his book on the subject is forthcoming from Johns Hopkins
University Press. His quantitative analysis of metaphor use by various authors provides a historical
perspective on the notions of conventionality, novelty, and change in metaphor. In the neoclassical poetic
tradition, the main virtue of a metaphor was not a strikingly fresh and original turn of thought (a property
iii
that is often stereotypically associated with poetic metaphor), but rather its ability to express a common
thought in a particularly apt fashion (“what oft was thought, but ne’er so well expressed”, to quote
Alexander Pope). The idea of metaphors being in alignment with common ways of thinking while at
the same time being noticeably different expressions of these thoughts has a complex and interesting
relationship with the contemporary theories of conceptual metaphor.
Dr. Rebecca Resnik, Director of Mindwell Psychology Bethesda, completes the talks at this year’s
workshop. Dr. Resnik is a Licensed Psychologist in private practice, specializing in neuropsychological
and emotional assessment of children and adults, as well as psychotherapy. The way people describe
their experiences represents a pattern recognition task for clinicians, one that is at times enshrined in
assessment tools (e.g., the Vanderbilt scale that asks if a child appears to be “driven by a motor”). The
use of metaphor, for instance in identifying cognitive distortions and automatic negative thoughts, holds
much interest for the clinical community. In exploring the relationship between metaphor and clinical
diagnosis, Dr. Resnik offers a unique outlook on potential applications of metaphor-related technology.
Adjourning the workshop, a panel discussion is held to help elucidate the goals and directions of further
research on metaphor in NLP. Panelists include Prof. Jerry Hobbs, University of Southern California and
Dr. Tony Veale, University College Dublin.
We wish to thank everyone who showed interest and submitted a paper, all of the authors for their
contributions, the members of the Program Committee for their thoughtful reviews, the invited speaker
and panelists for sharing their perspectives on the topic, and all the attendees of the workshop. All of
these factors contribute to a truly enriching event!

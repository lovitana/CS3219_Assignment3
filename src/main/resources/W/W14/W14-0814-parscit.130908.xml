<bodyText confidence="0.999936444444444">
This contribution presents the newest
version of our ’Wortverbindungsfelder’
(fields of multi-word expressions), an ex-
perimental lexicographic resource that fo-
cusses on aspects of MWEs that are rarely
addressed in traditional descriptions: Con-
texts, patterns and interrelations. The
MWE fields use data from a very large
corpus of written German (over 6 billion
word forms) and are created in a strictly
corpus-based way. In addition to tradi-
tional lexicographic descriptions, they in-
clude quantitative corpus data which is
structured in new ways in order to show
the usage specifics. This way of looking
at MWEs gives insight in the structure of
language and is especially interesting for
foreign language learners.

1 Our concept of MWEs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801421052632">
We study MWEs from a linguistic perspective
and are mainly interested in two questions: What
can we learn about the nature of MWEs and their
status in language by studying large corpora? And
how can we present MWEs in novel lexicographic
ways that reflect our findings? The MWE field
presented in this contribution is a prototype
that reflects our current ideas regarding these
questions. It can be explored online free of charge
at http://wvonline.ids-mannheim.
de/wvfelder-v3/index.html.
Our approach is based on the concept ’Usuelle
Wortverbindungen’ (UWV, Steyer 2000; Steyer
2004; Steyer 2013), which defines MWEs as con-
ventionalized patterns of language use that man-
ifest themselves in recurrent syntagmatic struc-
tures. This includes not only idioms and idiosyn-
cratic structures, but all multi-word units which
have acquired a distinct function in communica-

tion. Our focus is on real-life usage, pragmat-
ics and context. We work bottom-up in detecting
and describing MWE units in a strongly corpus-
driven way (Sinclair 1991; Tognini-Bonelli 2001;
Hanks 2013), taking iterative steps to arrive at
conclusions about language use. Methologi-
cally, our approach bears some similarities to
Stefanowitsch/Gries’ ’collostructions’ (Stefanow-
itsch/Gries 2003) though we are less interested in
syntactic and grammatical structures - as it is com-
mon in construction grammar approaches - but see
MWEs primarily as parts of the lexicon and feel
closer to phraseology.
The basis of our research is DeReKo (Deutsches
Referenzkorpus, Institut für Deutsche Sprache
2012), the largest collection of written German
available today which has over six billion word to-
kens and is located at the Institute for the German
Language (IDS). In the current stage of our work,
which is mainly explorative, we use DeReKo as
it is. This means our text basis is dominated by
newspaper texts from the last 10-15 years. Though
this is surely not a ’balanced’ corpus, we argue that
it still reflects much of contemporary written lan-
guage use, as newspaper texts are a medium that
is widely disseminated.
Though the interpretation and main analysis is
done manually, automatic methods form an im-
portant basis to our work. We use a sophisti-
cated method of collocation analysis developed at
the IDS (Belica 1995) to get indications which
word combinations constitute MWEs and to ex-
plore contexts in which an MWE is commonly
used. In addition to that, we use a pattern matching
tool developed in our project to explore and struc-
ture corpus evidence and gain further insight into
the behavior and variations of MWE candidates.
Our special interest lies in the fact that MWEs
are not as fixed as is often assumed, but often be-
have as patterns and show multiple interrelations.
Therefore, we also describe MWE patterns - a

more abstract form of MWEs which are only par-
tially fixed. An example for a fixed MWE is Pi
mal Daumen (pi times thumb - ’approximately’),
a multi-word expression that is always used in ex-
actly this form. MWE patterns on the other hand
consist of fixed lexical components as well as slots
that can be filled in different ways. In spite of this
variability, the whole pattern has a holistic mean-
ing and function. An example is the expression
wie NOUN in jemandes Ohren klingen (to sound
like NOUN in someone’s ears - ’to be perceived in
a certain way’ (specified by NOUN)). The NOUN
slot can be filled with different words in order to
specify the general meaning of the pattern. In sec-
tion 2.3 we will go into further detail about how a
slot in an MWE pattern can be filled.
The MWE field presented in this contri-
bution centers around the word Grund (rea-
son/basis/foundation) combined with several
prepositions. It is the newest of several versions
of MWE fields which have been described
elsewhere (cf. Brunner/Steyer 2009; Brunner/
Steyer 2010) and are available at our website
http://wvonline.ids-mannheim.de
as well. This newest version focusses more on
hierarchies of MWEs and MWE patterns and
incorporates additional resources like collocation
analyses in its descriptive texts. In the following,
we will highlight some features of the MWE
field which illustrate our focus on interrelations,
contexts and patterns.

2.1 Interrelations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971689655172">
Figure 1 shows a part of the MWE field, centered
on the word Grund and preposition aus. Each
node is linked to a lexicographic description. Fig-
ure 2 presents a screenshot of one of those articles.
In addition to narrative descriptions and manu-
ally selected usage examples from our corpus, the
articles also include components that are derived
from quantitative corpus data. Specifically, these
are collocation analyses as well as filler tables for
MWE patterns. The function of these components
will be explained in more detail in sections 2.2 and
2.3.
In Figure 1, you can observe the relations be-
tween MWEs (thick border) and MWE patterns
(regular border). The nodes with the dashed bor-
der represent repeating surface structures which
themselves have no common holistic meaning but
show the lexical interconnectedness between the
MWEs and MWE patterns.
All nodes enclosed in the square field contain
the elements Grund and auf. The nodes on the
far right are extensions which do not belong to
the core of the MWE field as it was defined, but
are connected lexically and functionally to MWEs
that do. We decided to include those ’external
nodes’ to give a glimpse of how the building
blocks of language connect even beyond the arti-
ficial borders that where necessary when defining
the MWE field.

perordinated Nodes’. The part ’Context Analysis’ contains links to a filler table and to the corresponding
KWIC lines.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974782608696">
In this example the core field contains the
MWEs aus welchem Grund auch immer and aus
welchen Gründen auch immer (’for whatever rea-
son/s’). However, the lexical components auch
immer are part of more general patterns as well.
The word form Grund can be substituted by differ-
ent nouns in the MWE pattern aus welch- SUB-G
auch immer (e.g. Motiv (motive), Richtung (di-
rection)). In the MWE pattern PRON auch im-
mer the place is taken by an interrogative pronoun
(e.g. was (what), wo (where), wer (who), warum
(why)). One of those pronoun fillers, wie (how),
is much more frequent than the others, which jus-
tifies the definition of a separate MWE wie auch
immer, which can be translated as ’howsoever’ or
’to whatever extent’ (see section 2.3 for more de-
tails).
The basic structure of the MWE field thus
highlights the different degrees of abstraction of
MWEs and the functional use of lexical clusters
like auch immer. The lexicographic descriptions
linked to the nodes explain the interrelations and
the differences in usage and meaning.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999823888888889">
Another important aspect of our approach to
MWEs is that we pay close attention to the con-
texts in which they are commonly used. A good
tool to explore this empirically is collocation anal-
ysis. In addition to narrative descriptions and man-
ually selected corpus examples we therefore in-
clude the results of collocation analysis in our ar-
ticles.
One interesting aspect is the difference between

<bodyText confidence="0.999870041666667">
MWEs and their single-lexeme quasi-synonyms.
For example the meaning of the MWE im Grunde
is very close to the lexeme eigentlich (actually).
Figures 3 and 4 show the highest ranking results
of a collocation analysis that focusses on a window
of five words in front of the units eigentlich and im
Grunde respectively and calculates the log likeli-
hood ratio.1 When comparing the results for these
two units you can see that there are some con-
texts that are strongly preferred by eigentlich but
are not highly ranked for im Grunde. Notable are
the combination schade eigentlich (sad actually)
as well as combinations with interrogative adverbs
like wie (how), was (what), warum (why). The
MWE im Grunde, on the other hand, has strong
collocation partners that are capitalized conjunc-
tions like aber (but) or denn (because). This in-
dicates a clear tendency to appear near the begin-
ning of a sentence in contexts where an argument
is made, which is not prominent for eigentlich. So
even if a quasi-synonymous single lexeme exists,
the MWE shows differences in usage which be-
come apparent when studying large quantities of
data.

2.3 Patterns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855233333333">
As mentioned before, MWE patterns are of special
interest to us. When exploring MWEs, we use a
pattern matching tool that allows us to search large
quantities of keyword in context lines (KWICs) for
combinations of fixed strings and slots. The lexi-
cal fillers of these slots can also be counted and
presented in the form of frequency tables. This al-
lows us to explore which kinds of variations are
possible and typical for an MWE. The filler tables
can show quite different ’profiles’ for a slot. In the
following, we will give some examples.
For the MWE aus welchen Gründen auch im-
mer (for whatever reasons) we checked whether
the element Gründen can be modified by searching
for the pattern aus welchen #* Gründen
auch immer (#* stands for a slot that can be
filled by any number of words). Table 1 shows the
absolute and relative frequencies that where calcu-
lated from KWIC lines of our corpus. In the vast
majority of cases, the slot is empty, which means
that the MWE is used exactly in the form cited
above: aus welchen Gründen auch immer. It is
thus very stable, though not completely inflexible,
as there is also evidence of adjectives that are used
to further specify the reasons in question, e.g. per-
sönlichen Gründen (personal reasons).
A different example of filler behavior can be
observed when studying the pattern # auch
immer (# marks a slot that has to be filled with
exactly one word). Table 2 shows that this slot

nearly 18 percent of the matches. In this case, a
single lexical filler is very dominant. This was a
strong indication for us that the pattern wie auch

time being a prototypical realization of the pat-
tern PRON auch immer. Also quite frequent is the
filler Gründen, which indicates the pattern [aus

A different filler profile (Table 3) can be ob-

none of these is so dominant and striking that a
separate MWE needs to be considered. However,
the fillers can be grouped into functional groups,
like type of the reasons (e.g. politisch (political),
persönlich (personal), finanziell (financial)), va-
lidity of the reasons (e.g. nachvollziehbar (under-
standable), gut (good), triftig (valid)) or relevance
of the reasons (e.g. wichtig (important), zwingend
(imperative)).
You can see that filler tables are very useful for
different purposes: To confirm the fixedness of an
MWE and explore occasional variations, to con-
ceptualize lexical units in order to build up hierar-
chies, and to further describe and understand the
behavior of MWE patterns. Not only do we work
with such patterns and filler tables when building
the MWE field, we also include them in our de-
scriptions - another way to give a user access to
original corpus data structured in an informative
way.
Additionally, we provide access to the KWIC
lines that were used to calculate the filler tables.
Table 4 shows some of the lines that match the
pattern aus # Gründen. These lines are struc-
tured in fields according to the search pattern and
the different columns can be sorted. In this way,
you can explore the use of specific MWE struc-
tures yourself.

3 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995">
We believe that our MWE fields allow a different
way to look at MWEs which is very useful to un-
derstand the structure of language. As they are
strictly based on data from a large modern lan-
guage corpus, our findings also reflect real, con-
temporary language use. This is especially useful
for foreign language learners who struggle to nav-
igate the complexities of fixedness and variability
in the German language. In continuing our MWE
research, we strive to refine our strategies for de-
scription and visualization and also plan to add
contrastive studies in the future.

Our special interest lies in the fact that MWEs are not as fixed as is often assumed, but often behave as patterns and show multiple interrelations. Therefore, we also describe MWE patterns a of the 10th Workshop on Multiword Expressions (MWE pages 82–88, Sweden, 26-27 April 2014. Association for Computational Linguistics 1: Part of the MWE field centered around preposition more abstract form of MWEs which are only parfixed. An example for a fixed MWE is Daumen times thumb ’approximately’), a multi-word expression that is always used in exactly this form. MWE patterns on the other hand consist of fixed lexical components as well as slots that can be filled in different ways. In spite of this variability, the whole pattern has a holistic meaning and function. An example is the expression NOUN in jemandes Ohren klingen sound NOUN in someone’s ears ’to be perceived in a certain way’ (specified by NOUN)). The NOUN slot can be filled with different words in order to specify the general meaning of the pattern. In section 2.3 we will go into further detail about how a slot in an MWE pattern can be filled. The MWE field presented in this contricenters around the word combined with several prepositions. It is the newest of several versions of MWE fields which have been described elsewhere (cf. Brunner/Steyer 2009; Brunner/ Steyer 2010) and are available at our website http://wvonline.ids-mannheim.de as well. This newest version focusses more on hierarchies of MWEs and MWE patterns and incorporates additional resources like collocation analyses in its descriptive texts. In the following, we will highlight some features of the MWE field which illustrate our focus on interrelations, contexts and patterns. MWE field 2.1 Interrelations Figure 1 shows a part of the MWE field, centered the word preposition Each node is linked to a lexicographic description. Figure 2 presents a screenshot of one of those articles. In addition to narrative descriptions and manually selected usage examples from our corpus, the articles also include components that are derived from quantitative corpus data. Specifically, these are collocation analyses as well as filler tables for MWE patterns. The function of these components will be explained in more detail in sections 2.2 and 2.3. In Figure 1, you can observe the relations between MWEs (thick border) and MWE patterns (regular border). The nodes with the dashed border represent repeating surface structures which themselves have no common holistic meaning but show the lexical interconnectedness between the MWEs and MWE patterns. All nodes enclosed in the square field contain elements The nodes on the far right are extensions which do not belong to the core of the MWE field as it was defined, but are connected lexically and functionally to MWEs that do. We decided to include those ’external nodes’ to give a glimpse of how the building blocks of language connect even beyond the artificial borders that where necessary when defining the MWE field. 83 2: MWE article welchen Gründen auch immer the MWE field The article parts are ’Frequency in the Corpus’, ’General description’, ’Context Analysis’, ’Contrast Analysis’ and ’Superordinated Nodes’. The part ’Context Analysis’ contains links to a filler table and to the corresponding KWIC lines. In this example the core field contains the welchem Grund auch immer Gründen auch immer whatever rea- However, the lexical components part of more general patterns as well. word form be substituted by differnouns in the MWE pattern welch- SUB-G immer (motive), Richtung (di- In the MWE pattern auch implace is taken by an interrogative pronoun (what), wo (where), wer (who), warum One of those pronoun fillers, is much more frequent than the others, which justhe definition of a separate MWE auch which can be translated as ’howsoever’ or ’to whatever extent’ (see section 2.3 for more details). The basic structure of the MWE field thus highlights the different degrees of abstraction of MWEs and the functional use of lexical clusters The lexicographic descriptions linked to the nodes explain the interrelations and the differences in usage and meaning. 2.2 Contexts Another important aspect of our approach to MWEs is that we pay close attention to the contexts in which they are commonly used. A good tool to explore this empirically is collocation analysis. In addition to narrative descriptions and manually selected corpus examples we therefore include the results of collocation analysis in our articles. One interesting aspect is the difference between 84 3: Highest ranking results of the collocation analysis for 5 words in front). MWEs and their single-lexeme quasi-synonyms. example the meaning of the MWE Grunde very close to the lexeme Figures 3 and 4 show the highest ranking results of a collocation analysis that focusses on a window five words in front of the units and calculates the log likeli- When comparing the results for these two units you can see that there are some conthat are strongly preferred by not highly ranked for Notable are combination eigentlich as well as combinations with interrogative adverbs (how), was (what), warum The on the other hand, has strong collocation partners that are capitalized conjunclike (but) This indicates a clear tendency to appear near the beginning of a sentence in contexts where an argument made, which is not prominent for So even if a quasi-synonymous single lexeme exists, the MWE shows differences in usage which become apparent when studying large quantities of data. details on the collocation analysis used here see 2004. The settings were: Wgesamt alle Korpora des Archivs W (mit Neuakquisitionen); Archiv-Release: Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo-2013- II); Analyse-Kontext : 5. Wort links bis 0. Wort rechts; Granularität: grob; Zuverlässigkeit: analytisch; Clusterzuordnung: mehrfach; Auf 1 Satz beschränkt: ja; Lemmatisierung: nein; Funktionswörter: zugelassen; Autofokus: aus 2.3 Patterns As mentioned before, MWE patterns are of special interest to us. When exploring MWEs, we use a pattern matching tool that allows us to search large quantities of keyword in context lines (KWICs) for combinations of fixed strings and slots. The lexical fillers of these slots can also be counted and presented in the form of frequency tables. This allows us to explore which kinds of variations are possible and typical for an MWE. The filler tables can show quite different ’profiles’ for a slot. In the following, we will give some examples. the MWE welchen Gründen auch imwhatever we checked whether element be modified by searching the pattern welchen #* Gründen immer for a slot that can be filled by any number of words). Table 1 shows the absolute and relative frequencies that where calculated from KWIC lines of our corpus. In the vast majority of cases, the slot is empty, which means that the MWE is used exactly in the form cited welchen Gründen auch It is thus very stable, though not completely inflexible, as there is also evidence of adjectives that are used further specify the reasons in question, e.g. per- Gründen (personal A different example of filler behavior can be when studying the pattern auch a slot that has to be filled with exactly one word). Table 2 shows that this slot 85 4: Highest ranking results of the collocation analysis for Grunde 5 words in front).

A different filler profile (Table 3) can be obfor the pattern # Gründen # This is a true MWE pattern, as it has a specific communicative function tied to the plural form of Grund: reasons are mentioned, but left intentionally vague. Table 3 shows that there is a large number of adjectives that can fill the gap.

However, the fillers can be grouped into functional groups, type of the reasons (e.g. (political), (personal), finanziell vaof the reasons (e.g. (undergut (good), triftig or relevance the reasons (e.g. (important), zwingend You can see that filler tables are very useful for different purposes: To confirm the fixedness of an MWE and explore occasional variations, to conceptualize lexical units in order to build up hierarchies, and to further describe and understand the behavior of MWE patterns. Not only do we work with such patterns and filler tables when building the MWE field, we also include them in our descriptions another way to give a user access to original corpus data structured in an informative way. Additionally, we provide access to the KWIC lines that were used to calculate the filler tables. Table 4 shows some of the lines that match the tured in fields according to the search pattern and the different columns can be sorted. In this way, you can explore the use of specific MWE structures yourself. 3 Conclusion We believe that our MWE fields allow a different way to look at MWEs which is very useful to understand the structure of language. As they are strictly based on data from a large modern language corpus, our findings also reflect real, contemporary language use. This is especially useful for foreign language learners who struggle to navigate the complexities of fixedness and variability in the German language. In continuing our MWE research, we strive to refine our strategies for description and visualization and also plan to add contrastive studies in the future.</abstract>

Our focus is on real-life usage, pragmatics and context. We work bottom-up in detecting and describing MWE units in a strongly corpusdriven way (Sinclair 1991; Tognini-Bonelli 2001; Hanks 2013), taking iterative steps to arrive at conclusions about language use. Methologically, our approach bears some similarities to Stefanowitsch/Gries’ ’collostructions’ (Stefanowitsch/Gries 2003) though we are less interested in syntactic and grammatical structures - as it is common in construction grammar approaches - but see MWEs primarily as parts of the lexicon and feel closer to phraseology. The basis of our research is DeReKo (Deutsches Referenzkorpus, Institut für Deutsche Sprache 2012), the largest collection of written German available today which has over six billion word to</context>

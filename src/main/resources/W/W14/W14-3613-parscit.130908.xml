<bodyText confidence="0.999937222222222">
In this paper, we propose TunDiaWN
(Tunisian dialect Wordnet) a lexical re-
source for the dialect language spoken in
Tunisia. Our TunDiaWN construction
approach is founded, in one hand, on a
corpus based method to analyze and ex-
tract Tunisian dialect words. A clustering
technique is adapted and applied to mine
the possible relations existing between
the Tunisian dialect extracted words and
to group them into meaningful groups.
All these suggestions are then evaluated
and validated by the experts to perform
the resource enrichment task. We reuse
other Wordnet versions, mainly for Eng-
lish and Arabic language to propose a
new database structure enriched by inno-
vative features and entities.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999847886792453">
The Arabic Dialects have become increasingly
used in social networks and web 2.0 (blogs, fo-
rums, newspaper, newsgroups, etc.) instead of
Standard Arabic (SA).
Consequently, new kinds of texts appeared being
mainly dialect-written or having a mixture be-
tween Arabic Dialects and Standard Arabic.
Thus, innovative opportunities and challenges
arise when we try to deal with the automatic pro-
cessing of such data in order to seek out useful
information and take advantages of their growing
availability and popularity. The NLP approaches
generally applied lexical resources for the target
language. Such resources are useful in several
tasks which involve a language meaning under-
standing like: opinion mining (Kim et al., 2004;
Bouchlaghem et al. 2010), information retrieval
(Valeras et al., 2005; Rosso et al., 2004), query
expansion (Parapar et al., 2005), text categoriza-
tion (Rosso et al., 2004; Ramakrishnan et al.,
2003), and many other applications.
However, this situation poses significant difficul-
ties in the context of dialectal data because of the
huge lack of Dialect-Standard Arabic lexical re-
sources. Building similar ones is a big challenge
since spoken dialects are not officially written,
don’t have a standard orthography and are con-
sidered as under-resourced languages, unlike
standard languages.
In this paper, we address the problem of creating
a linguistic resource for an Arabic dialect. We
describe our approach towards building a Word-
net for Tunisian dialect (TD). We proceed, first-
ly, to construct a TD corpus by collecting data
from various resources (social networks, web-
sites, TD dictionaries, etc.). We develop a clus-
tering based method that aims to organize the TD
corpus words by grouping them into clusters.
The suggested organization possibilities are,
then, analyzed and validated by the TD experts
during the TunDiaWN enrichment process. Our
proposed database structure is designed to be
able to highlight the specificities of the TD lexi-
con. It also takes advantage of Arabic Wordnet
(AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006), the Arabic version
of the widely used lexico-semantic resource
Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998).
This can be justified by the assumption that Tu-
nisian Arabic has a great resemblance with
Standard Arabic.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we
begin by presenting works related to existing
wordnets and approaches focused on the auto-

introduce the posed challenges and the hypothe-
sis we have assumed in building the TunDiaWN.
In the next section, we proceed to explain and
justify the proposed approach for developing the
initial version of the Tunisian Arabic lexical re-
source. Firstly, we detail the TD data collect pro-

ed from the corpus. Then, we describe the pro-
posed structure of TunDiaWN, especially the
new added features and entities as well as the
validation task performed by the TD experts. In
the following section, we perform a linguistic
analysis by reporting significant observations
related to TD-SA discovered during the enrich-
ment process. Conclusion and future works are

The first version of wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998)
was developed for English at Princeton Universi-
ty. It’s a large lexical database where words hav-
ing the same part of speech (Nouns, verbs, adjec-
tives, adverbs) are gathered in sets of cognitive
synonyms (synsets), each one expressing a dis-
tinct concept. Each word can belong to one or
more synsets. The resulting synsets are connect-
ed by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical
relations well labeled such as hyponymy and an-
tonymy.
The success of the Princeton WordNet has moti-
vated the development of similar resources for
other languages, such as EuroWordNet, EWN
(Vossen, 1998) interlinking wordnets of several
European languages (Dutch, Italian, Spanish,
German, French, Czech and Estonian); Balkanet
(Tufis, 2004) comprising wordnets of the Balkan
languages; and recently Arabic Wordnet (AWN)
(Elkateb et al., 2006).
AWN was released following methods devel-
oped for EuroWordNet. These methods revolve
about the manual encoding of a set of Common
Base Concepts (CBC), the most important con-
cepts from the 12 languages in EWN and Bal-
kaNet. Other language-specific concepts are add-
ed and translated manually to the closest syn-
set(s) in Arabic. Such resource aims to link ara-
bic words and synsets to english ones.
AWN is related to the Classical Arabic
(or Literal Arabic) which refers to the official
standard form of the Arabic language used in
Arab world. Other variants of Arabic are dialects
which are spoken and informal. They are the
primary form of Arabic Language.
The Tunisian dialect (cf. Table 1) or ‘Darija’ is
one of the Maghreb Dialects and is mainly spo-
ken by Tunisian people (Baccouche, 1994).

Most of the works that dealt with the automatic
processing of Tunisian dialect are based on spo-
ken dialogue corpus. To mention, Graja et al.
(2011) performed a lexical study of manual tran-
scription of conversations recorded in the railway
station for understanding speech. The application
is domain dependant and, thus, the vocabulary is
limited. Moreover, Zribi et al. (2013) introduced
a lexicon for the Tunisian dialect in order to
adapt an existing morphological analyzer initial-
ly designed for Standard Arabic. Although the
method shows good results, the proposed lexicon
is far to be complete. Boujelbane et al. (2013)
presented a method that aims to construct bilin-
gual dictionary using explicit knowledge about
the relation between Tunisian dialect and Stand-
ard Arabic. This approach was limited to the
verbs.

3 Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999803714285714">
In the last years, Tunisian dialect is widely used
in new written media and web 2.0, especially in
social networks, blogs, forums, weblogs, etc., in
addition to conversational media (Diab et al.,
2007).
Thinking about building a wordnet for Tunisian
dialect is a big challenge. In fact, like most of
dialects around the world, Tunisian Arabic is
considered as spoken language with no conven-
tional written form. Moreover, there is a lack of
Tunisian dialect-Standard Arabic resources and
tools.
Recently, Cavalli-Sforza et al. (2013) proposed a
process for creating a basic Iraqi Dialect Word-
Net. This work is based on other languages
wordnets as well as a bidirectional English-Iraqi
Arabic dictionary. To our knowledge, no other
open source Wordnet for the Standard Arabic or
Arabic Dialect has been developed to date.
To deal with these difficulties, we decide to pro-
duce a TD corpus gathering texts from multiple

<bodyText confidence="0.999944857142857">
sources. This corpus provides a useful starting
point for building a wordnet for Tunisian dialect.
We assume that Arabic Dialects can be presumed
to be similar to Standard Arabic, particularly in
their conceptual organization. Indeed, the Tuni-
sian dialect has a sophisticated form which com-
bines Standard Arabic and Tunisian dialect spe-
cific forms. It has a great resemblance to the SA
and adds some variances such as foreign words
borrowed from other languages. Thus, given the
similarities between the TD and the SA, the re-
sources available to SA, such as AWN, can be
favorably used for creating Tunisian dialectal
resources.

The classical building WordNets methodologies
start from the CBC, and then make changes
according to the concerned language.
We propose a new corpus-based approach to cre-
ate WordNet resource for Tunisian dialect, which
deviates from the strategies commonly adopted.
As shows Figure 1, our approach is performed in
four steps:
a. Tunisian dialect textual data collect: it con-
sists in producing our MultiTD corpus (Mul-
ti-source Tunisian dialect corpus) which
gathers TD texts from many sources: social
networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.), written
pieces of theater, dictionaries, transcriptions
of spontaneous speech, etc.

b. TD words extraction: is to preprocess the

tering based method that aims to group the
extracted TD words into meaningful clusters,
which represent great suggestions for possible
enrichments of TunDiaWN.

by the TD experts. It includes the manual val-
idation of the suggestions proposed by the
previous step. We propose, in this stage, a
new database structure for TunDiaWN. The
experts have to add the necessary features
values, particularly the TD specific attributes
(details in section 4.4).

We set out to collect data for Tunisian dialect in

We created the MultiTD corpus by gathering TD

The most practical source of TD texts is online
data, which is more individual-driven and less
formal, and consequently more likely to com-

Other online available TD resources are used to
enrich the MultiTD corpus. We cite notably, the
Karmous dictionary for Tunisian Arabic1 which
comprises more than 3,800 TD words and sever-
al Tunisian proverbs and expressions organized
by themes.
We use also an online TD dictionary 2 consisting
of over 4,000 words and expressions; and many
short TD texts3 related to various areas: songs,
theater, newspaper articles, etc.

<bodyText confidence="0.999878222222222">
To successfully extract all TD words, the input
texts must be preprocessed. In our study, the pre-
processing consists, firstly, to clean the input
files so as to identify the textual content. The
cleaned texts are then segmented in order to ex-
tract all existing TD words.
Cleaning a raw textual source is necessary in our
approach because the documents are collected
from the Web. All non-textual data such as im-
ages, advertisements, scripts, etc. have to be
eliminated. For this purpose, we have developed
a module that removes all unwanted parts from
the input documents.
The cleaned texts are then segmented into ele-
mentary textual units and the obtained TD words
are extracted and stored in CSV files.

composing the MultiTD corpus.

The TunDiaWN construction is based on a semi-
automatic process in which the validation tasks
performed by experts are crucial.
As Table 2 Shows, the MultiTD corpus includes
a huge number of TD words. The manual analy-
sis and organization of such large data looks
wasteful and time consuming.
In order to support experts in the organization
and validation tasks and guide them during the
construction process, we propose a clustering-
based method to automatically arrange the TD
words set into groups. The method aims to sug-
gest possible organizations of the given TD
words by gathering them into meaningful clus-
ters.
To enhance similarities and meanings into the
produced groups, we propose to cluster the TD
words according to their TD roots. We rely here
on the derivational morphology that characteriz-
es the Tunisian dialect as well as the Standard
Arabic.
In fact, many SA words having a common root 4
can be derived from a base verbal form and have
related meanings. An example of such a field for
the root سرد, ‘to study,’ is shown in Table 3.

We don’t search here to automatically enrich the
TunDiaWN structure by attaching new TD
words, but we rather suggest new attachments
and enrichment possibilities which can help the
experts.
Our aim at this step is to group words having the
same root. To do this task, we apply and adapt
the K-modes clustering algorithm (Huang, 1997).
The K-modes algorithm extends K-means (For-
gy, 1965; MacQueen, 1967) paradigm to cluster
categorical data by removing the numeric data
limitation. Indeed, the K-modes algorithm intro-
duces a new simple matching dissimilarity meas-
ure for categorical data objects. The algorithm
replaces means of clusters with modes, and uses
a frequency based method to update modes in the
clustering process.
The choice of K-modes clustering algorithm is
mainly motivated because of its widely use in
real world applications due to its efficiency in
dealing with large categorical database (He et al.,
2011). K-modes algorithm is also faster than oth-
er clustering algorithms (mainly k-means) since
it needs less iteration to produce a stable distribu-
tion. .
The K-modes algorithm requires a similarity
measurement to be used between the objects. In
our case, we propose to use the N-Gram similari-
ty measurement between words. N-Gram is lan-
guage independent in nature and doesn’t require
specific resources to be applied. Therefore, N-
gram model seems suitable for dealing with a
Tunisian dialect context. We applied the N-Gram
distance proposed by Kondrak (2005) and we
used the implementation provided by Apache
Lucene spellchecking API5.
The K-modes algorithm consists of the following
steps:
a) Select K initial modes, one for each of the
cluster.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.5114765">
5 The project can be freely obtained from:

</footnote>
<listItem confidence="0.997880833333333">
b) Allocate data object to the cluster whose mode
is nearest to it, according to the simple matching
dissimilarity
c) Compute new modes of all clusters.
d) Repeat step b to c until no data object has
changed cluster membership.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953892857143">
The classical K-modes algorithm assumes that
the number of clusters, K, is known in advance
and the clusters’ modes are randomly initialized.
The K-modes algorithm is very sensitive to these
choices and an improper choice may then yield
highly undesirable cluster structures. (Khan et
al., 2013).
In order to deal with these drawbacks and, there-
after, maximize the performance of the algo-
rithm, we propose a new initialization strategy
for the k-modes algorithm.
Indeed, since our goal is to cluster words accord-
ing to their roots, the TD roots are assigned to
clusters modes in the initialization step instead of
random initialization. The number of clusters (K)
will, thus, take the cardinality of the target TD
roots set. Therefore, the K-modes algorithm
starts with k clusters each having as mode one
root among the TD roots list initially translated.
We have also adopted a new strategy based on
the N-Gram similarity measurement to update
clusters’ modes. The modes update is performed
at the end of each iteration. For each cluster, the
item qualified as new cluster mode must maxim-
ize the similarity sum with the rest of cluster ob-
jects.
The K-modes algorithm adapted for our purpose
performs as following:

As our target language is an Arabic Dialect and
therefore likely to share many of the Standard
Arabic concepts, we decide to preserve the AWN
design. However, the AWN current structure is
unable to support the specificities of the Tunisian
dialect lexicon. The proposed TunDiaWN struc-
ture is then enriched by new features, entities and
relations. Moreover, we aim to create a parallel
resource which maintains the linkage between
Tunisian dialectal, Arabic as well as English
synsets and words. That’s why AWN and PWN
contents are preserved rather than the structures.
Thus, the proposed database is designed to be
able to support English, Tunisian and Standard
Arabic content and correspondence.
In this section, we detail the structure of the pro-
posed TunDiaWN database and we focus on the
new features we added to keep up the TD vocab-

English ones.

Synset: includes English and Arabic synsets. A
synset has descriptive information such as Name,
POS (Part Of Speech), root (Boolean feature in-

Word: comprises words from different lan-
guages. In addition to the unique identifier, every
word is described by his value, and a Boolean
“valid” attribute which indicates if one word is
already validated by experts or not yet.
Form: includes mainly the root of Arabic as well
as Tunisian dialect words.
Synsets relations: includes links relating two
synsets, like “has_instance”, “equivalent”,
“similar”, etc. We preserve here all sunsets’ links
without adding new ones.
Words relations: two English words can be
linked by “pertainym” or “antonym” relations.
There are no added Arabic words relations.
Annotator: is used to indicate who has validated
each word. The attribute “region” helps to classi-
fy words by region and identify where words
come from. We assume here that the annotator
will do his job according to the background of
his native region.

The use of foreign words is a prominent feature
in the Tunisian community due to historical rea-
sons. Foreign words are used in almost everyday
conversation.
The following table (table 6) illustrates the use of
foreign words next to Tunisian dialect ones in the
same sentence.

A TD corpus study found that pure French
origin words are ubiquitous and represent
11.81% of the dialogue corpus (Graja et al,
2010).
Tunisian dialect can also borrow and adapt
words from other languages in order to make
them sound and behave like TD words.
As an illustration, the TD word “ ْ��ِ�ْ�َ�ْ�/ tonarofi-
yzo” is derived from the French word “ner-
vosité” and is synonym to the English word “an-
ger”.
As can be seen, the foreign words are part of the
Tunisian dialect vocabulary. Such words must
not be neglected. They must be added to any dic-
tionary of Tunisian dialect lexicon (Graja et al.
2010).
The foreign words used with their original forms
are added to the TunDiaWN database.
Concerning the TD words having foreign origins,
they are firstly distinguished from other TD
words. The second step consists in finding the
origin words in other languages, saving them and
linking them to the concerned TD words. Conse-
quently, the borrowed TD words are easily iden-
tified. Their basic language and words are
straightforwardly found and browsed.

Morphology
</subsubsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998408">
Since the Tunisian dialect has no standard or-
thography, one word can be written in many
forms using Arabic letters or Latin script. For
example, the word &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; can be expressed in
different ways: “bech”/ “ ْش�َ�”, “bich” /“ ْ�ِ�”,
“mich”/“ ْ�ِ�”.
To deal with this situation, our database structure
is enriched by a new entity named “morphology”
which allows storing all versions of a given TD
word.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979767">
Sub-dialect group
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999708125">
There are many varieties of Tunisian dialect tak-
ing into account the lexical variation depending
on Tunisian regions. We can distinguish mainly
three sub-dialects in the dialect of each region:
the townspeople, peasants/farmers, Be-Douin.
This is mainly due to the difference in cultures
which adds several different words from differ-
ent backgrounds having the same meaning. (Gra-
ja et al, 2010). The feature “sub-dialect” as well
as the “Region” of the annotator are used to give
further information about the origin of the target
word.
The TD words: “$aAf/ ْفU”, “roEaY/Ltَ ْر”,
“$obaH/ ْ�َ�ْ�”, “gozar/ ْرَ�ْ� ”, are used in different
Tunisian regions and are synonyms&lt; to the Eng-
lish word “to look”.

TunDiaWI enrichment task

<bodyText confidence="0.999978">
One of our strategic goals is to provide a parallel
resource which deal with the lack of parallel TD-
SA dictionaries and corpus. Therefore, we pro-
ceed by gathering Tunisian dialect and Standard
Arabic in one unique structure and maintain the
link with the Standard English too.
The starting point of the TunDiaWN enrichment
step is the groups of TD words, resulted of per-

forming our clustering based method. The TD
roots presumed to be the center of groups are
obtained by translating the SA roots available in
AWN.
For each TD root, the SA words related to the
equivalent SA root are extracted. Two lists of
words derived from equivalent roots are availa-
ble: one is related to a SA root, and the other is
from a TD one. The concerned SA synsets are
also available.
After that, the TD experts analyze and confront
the lists in order to find new synsets enrichment
opportunities. The TD words qualified to be re-
tained are those maximizing the synset harmony.
The TD experts must also fill in the necessary
attributes related to the added words and manual-
ly make the necessary changes and enrichments.
In fact, the added words have to be described
according to the new features added to the Tun-
DiaWN database, so as to bring different
knowledge of different vocabularies and give all
useful details related to the target word.
Linguistic study of the enriched Tun-
DiaWI
The linguistic study of the enrichment possibili-
ties validated by the TD experts shows many
important lexical trends in the TD lexicon com-
paring to the SA vocabulary.
A great part of Arabic synsets is enriched by
words that conserve the same SA roots and deri-
vation patterns but appear with small changes in
vowels (cf. table 7).

We distinguish also words derived from SA roots
via the application of specific derivation patterns
of TD (cf. table 8). Those words are omnipresent
in the TD lexicon.
Moreover, some TD words has identical mor-

There is another category of TD words which are
very similar to SA words, but use a different

For example, the SA word “ �� 44/ttasab—aba

TD word “V�a 44,4/tsab—ib fiy” with just different
vowels and new preposition.
In some cases, the SA words are linked to TD

there are no TD simple equivalent words, as il-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994405625">
We have described an approach for building a
Tunisian dialect lexical resource which takes ad-
vantages of online TD resources and reuses
Wordnets of other languages.
The proposed TunDiaWN can be considered as
parallel TD-SA resource since it preserves the
AWN content. Thanks to the novel added TD
attributes, the TunDiaWN design provides, also,
great opportunities to deal with the lack of a
standard written form and other specificities of
the Tunisian dialect.
The construction process begins with the Mul-
tiTD corpus construction from many sources.
After preprocessing the collected texts, the TD
extracted words are gathered according to their
common TD roots.

Now, the proposed TD resource is under con-
struction and evaluation. We plan to improve the
coverage of TunDiaWN and looking for other
TD specificities not yet covered. We plan also to
incorporate the French language into the Tun-
DiaWN content, taking advantages of the availa-

The suggested organization possibilities are, then, analyzed and validated by the TD experts during the TunDiaWN enrichment process. Our proposed database structure is designed to be able to highlight the specificities of the TD lexicon. It also takes advantage of Arabic Wordnet (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006), the Arabic version of the widely used lexico-semantic resource Princeton WordNet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998).

Conclusion and future works are presented in section 5. 2 Related works The first version of wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) was developed for English at Princeton University. It’s a large lexical database where words having the same part of speech (Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are gathered in sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each one expressing a distinct concept. Each word can belong to one or more synsets. The resulting synsets are connected by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations well labeled such as hyponymy and antonymy. The success of the Princeton WordNet has motivated the development of similar resources for other languages, such as EuroWordNet, EWN (Vossen, 1998) interlinking word</context>

Our aim at this step is to group words having the same root. To do this task, we apply and adapt the K-modes clustering algorithm (Huang, 1997). The K-modes algorithm extends K-means (Forgy, 1965; MacQueen, 1967) paradigm to cluster categorical data by removing the numeric data limitation. Indeed, the K-modes algorithm introduces a new simple matching dissimilarity measure for categorical data objects. The algorithm replaces means of clusters with modes, and uses a frequency based method to update modes in the clustering process. The choice of K-modes clustering algorithm is mainly motivated because of its widely use in real world applications due to its efficiency in dealing with large categorical database (He et al., 2011).

K-modes algorithm is also faster than other clustering algorithms (mainly k-means) since it needs less iteration to produce a stable distribution. . The K-modes algorithm requires a similarity measurement to be used between the objects. In our case, we propose to use the N-Gram similarity measurement between words. N-Gram is language independent in nature and doesn’t require specific resources to be applied. Therefore, Ngram model seems suitable for dealing with a Tunisian dialect context. We applied the N-Gram distance proposed by Kondrak (2005) and we used the implementation provided by Apache Lucene spellchecking API5. The K-modes algorithm consists of the following steps: a) Select K initial modes, one for each of the cluster. 5 The project can be freely obtained from: http://lucene.apache.org/core/ b) Allocate data object to the cluster whose mode is nearest to it, according to the simple matching dissimilarity c) Compute new modes of all clusters. d) Repeat step b to c until no data object has changed cluster membership. The classical K-modes algorithm assumes that the number of clusters, K, is known in advance and the clusters’</context>

Examples of French words widely used in TD communications A TD corpus study found that pure French origin words are ubiquitous and represent 11.81% of the dialogue corpus (Graja et al, 2010). Tunisian dialect can also borrow and adapt words from other languages in order to make them sound and behave like TD words. As an illustration, the TD word “ ْ��ِ�ْ�َ�ْ�/ tonarofiyzo” is derived from the French word “nervosité” and is synonym to the English word “anger”. As can be seen, the foreign words are part of the Tunisian dialect vocabulary. Such words must not be neglected. They must be added to any dictionary of Tunisian dialect lexicon (Graja et al. 2010). The foreign words used with their original forms are added to the TunDiaWN database. Concerning the TD words having foreign ori</context>

To deal with this situation, our database structure is enriched by a new entity named “morphology” which allows storing all versions of a given TD word. Sub-dialect group There are many varieties of Tunisian dialect taking into account the lexical variation depending on Tunisian regions. We can distinguish mainly three sub-dialects in the dialect of each region: the townspeople, peasants/farmers, Be-Douin. This is mainly due to the difference in cultures which adds several different words from different backgrounds having the same meaning. (Graja et al, 2010). The feature “sub-dialect” as well as the “Region” of the annotator are used to give further information about the origin of the target word. The TD words: “$aAf/ ْفU”, “roEaY/Ltَ ْر”, “$obaH/ ْ�َ�ْ�”, “gozar/ ْرَ�ْ� ”, are used in different Tunisian regions and are synonyms&lt; to the English word “to look”. TunDiaWI enrichment task One of our strategic goals is to provide a parallel resource which deal with the lack of parallel TDSA dictionaries and corpus. Therefore, we proceed by gathering Tunisian dialect and Standard Arabic in one unique structure and maintain the link with the Standard En</context>

It’s a large lexical database where words having the same part of speech (Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are gathered in sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each one expressing a distinct concept. Each word can belong to one or more synsets. The resulting synsets are connected by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations well labeled such as hyponymy and antonymy. The success of the Princeton WordNet has motivated the development of similar resources for other languages, such as EuroWordNet, EWN (Vossen, 1998) interlinking wordnets of several European languages (Dutch, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech and Estonian); Balkanet (Tufis, 2004) comprising wordnets of the Balkan languages; and recently Arabic Wordnet (AWN) (Elkateb et al., 2006). AWN was released following methods developed for EuroWordNet. These methods revolve about the manual encoding of a set of Common Base Concepts (CBC), the most important concepts from the 12 languages in EWN and BalkaNet. Other language-specific concepts are added and translated manually to the closest synset(s) in Arabic. Such resource aims to link arabic </context>

This approach was limited to the verbs. 3 Challenges In the last years, Tunisian dialect is widely used in new written media and web 2.0, especially in social networks, blogs, forums, weblogs, etc., in addition to conversational media (Diab et al., 2007). Thinking about building a wordnet for Tunisian dialect is a big challenge. In fact, like most of dialects around the world, Tunisian Arabic is considered as spoken language with no conventional written form. Moreover, there is a lack of Tunisian dialect-Standard Arabic resources and tools. Recently, Cavalli-Sforza et al. (2013) proposed a process for creating a basic Iraqi Dialect WordNet. This work is based on other languages wordnets as well as a bidirectional English-Iraqi Arabic dictionary. To our knowledge, no other open source Wordnet for the Standard Arabic or Arabic Dialect has been developed to date. To deal with these difficulties, we decide to produce a TD corpus gathering texts from multiple 105 sources. This corpus provides a useful starting point for building a wordnet for Tunisian dialect. We assume that Arabic Dialects can be presumed to be similar to Standard Arabic, particularly in their conceptual</context>

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999956434782609">
Much computational work has been done
on identifying and interpreting the mean-
ing of metaphors, but little work has been
done on understanding the motivation be-
hind the use of metaphor. To computation-
ally model discourse and social position-
ing in metaphor, we need a corpus anno-
tated with metaphors relevant to speaker
intentions. This paper reports a corpus
study as a first step towards computa-
tional work on social and discourse func-
tions of metaphor. We use Amazon Me-
chanical Turk (MTurk) to annotate data
from three web discussion forums cover-
ing distinct domains. We then compare
these to annotations from our own anno-
tation scheme which distinguish levels of
metaphor with the labels: nonliteral, con-
ventionalized, and literal. Our hope is that
this work raises questions about what new
work needs to be done in order to address
the question of how metaphors are used to
achieve social goals in interaction.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923666666667">
Our goal is to understand and characterize
the ways that nonliteral language, especially
metaphors, play a role in a variety of conversa-
tional strategies. In contrast to the large body
of work on uncovering the intended propositional
meaning behind metaphorical expressions, we are
most interested in the illocutionary and perlocu-
tionary force of the same contributions.
People use metaphorical expressions in a vari-
ety of ways in order to position themselves so-
cially and express attitudes, as well as to make
their point more effective, attractive, and convinc-
ing. Metaphors can be used to describe unfa-
miliar situations and feelings when the speaker
feels that literal description is inadequate. They
can also be used to display the speaker’s creativ-
ity and wit. They can further be used as a tac-
tic for persuasion or manipulation by foreground-
ing aspects that would not ordinarily be relevant.
Cameron (2007) shows that we can understand
social interactions and their contexts better by
closely looking at these patterns of metaphor use.
Metaphors can vary in how conventionalized
they are, from those which have lost their orig-
inal concrete meanings to completely novel and
vivid metaphors. Intuitively, it also makes sense
that metaphors which are more conventional and
less obviously metaphorical will be used with
less conscious thought than more novel or vivid
metaphors. There are thus reasons to suspect
that distinguishing between levels of metaphoric-
ity could give insight into patterns of use.
In this paper, we are interested in where we
can draw a line between levels of metaphoricity.
As a first step towards our long-term goal, we
present a corpus study in three web discussion
forums including a breast cancer support group,
a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), and
a forum for street gang members, which cover
distinctly different domains and have differing
community structure. First, we investigate how
laypeople intuitively recognize metaphor by con-
ducting Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) ex-
periments. Second, we introduce a new annota-
tion scheme for metaphorical expressions. In our
annotation scheme, we try to map the metaphor
spectrum of nonliteralness to three types of lan-
guage: nonliteral, conventionalized, and literal.
Our hope is that this distinction provides some
benefit in examining the social and discourse
functions of metaphor. Next, we compare MTurk

results with our annotations. Different people will
place the dividing line between literal language
and metaphorical language in different places. In
this work we have the opportunity to gauge how
much everyday conceptions of metaphoricity di-
verge from theoretical perspectives and therefore
how much models of metaphoricity may need to
be adapted in order to adequately characterize
metaphors in strategic use.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
relates our work to prior work on annotation and
a corpus study. Section 3 describes the data used
for annotation. Section 4 illustrates the functions
metaphor serves in discourse through a qualitative
analysis of our data. Section 5 explains our anno-
tation scheme. Section 6 presents our annotation
and MTurk experiments. Section 7 discusses the
results. Section 8 concludes the paper.

2 Relation to Prior Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999714">
In this section, we introduce the two main bodies
of relevant prior work on metaphor in language
technologies: computational metaphor processing
and metaphor annotation.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.933609">
2.1 Computational Work on Metaphor
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999367292682927">
Much of of the computational work on metaphor
can be classified into two tasks: automatic identi-
fication and interpretation of metaphors.
Metaphor identification has been done using
different approaches: violation of selectional pref-
erences (Fass, 1991), linguistic cues (Goatly,
1997), source and target domain words (Stefanow-
itsch and Gries, 2006), clustering (Birke and
Sarkar, 2006; Shutova et al., 2010), and lexi-
cal relations in WordNet (Krishnakumaran and
Zhu, 2007). Gedigian et al. (2006) and Li and
Sporleder (2010) distinguished the literal and non-
literal use of a target expression in text. In addi-
tion, Mason (2004) performed source-target do-
main mappings.
Metaphor interpretation is another large part
of the computational work on metaphor. Start-
ing with Martin (1990), a number of re-
searchers including Narayanan (1999), Barn-
den and Lee (2002), Agerri et al. (2007),
and Shutova (2010) have worked on the task.
Metaphor identification and interpretation was
performed simultaneously in (Shutova, 2013;
Shutova et al., 2013b).
As we have seen so far, much of the com-
putation work has focused on detecting and un-
covering the intended meaning behind metaphor-
ical expressions. On the other hand, Klebanov
and Flor (2013) paid attention to motivations be-
hind metaphor use, specifically metaphors used
for argumentation in essays. They showed a
moderate-to-strong correlation between percent-
age of metaphorically used words in an essay and
the writing quality score. We will introduce their
annotation protocol in Section 2.2.
However, to the best of our knowledge, not
much computational work has been done on
understanding the motivation behind the use
of metaphor besides that of Klebanov and
Flor (2013). Our work hopefully lays additional
foundation for the needed computational work.

2.2 Metaphor Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961413793104">
One of the main challenges in computational work
on metaphor is the lack of annotated datasets. An-
notating metaphorical language is nontrivial be-
cause of a lack of consensus regarding annotation
schemes and clear definitions. In this section, we
introduce some work dedicated to metaphor anno-
tation and a corpus study.
Wallington et al. (2003) conducted experiments
to investigate what identifies metaphors. Two dif-
ferent teams annotated the same text with differ-
ent instructions, one asked to label “interesting
stretches” and the other “metaphorical stretches”.
They also asked annotators to tag words or phrases
that indicated a metaphor nearby, in order to inves-
tigate signals of metaphoricity.
Pragglejaz Group (2007) presented a metaphor
annotation scheme, called the Metaphor Identifi-
cation Procedure (MIP), which introduced a sys-
tematic approach with clear decision rules. In this
scheme, a word is considered to be metaphorical if
it is not used according to its most basic concrete
meaning, and if its contextual meaning can be un-
derstood in comparison with the most basic con-
crete meaning. This method is relatively straight-
forward and can give high inter-reliability. De-
pending on how one decides upon the basic mean-
ing of words, this scheme can be used for different
applications. However, defining the basic mean-
ing of a word is nontrivial, and following the def-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999985138888889">
inition of basic meaning introduced in the paper
tends to result in a large proportion of words be-
ing annotated as metaphor. Many of the annotated
words would not be considered to be metaphors
by a layperson due to their long and widespread
usage.
Later works by Steen (2010), Shutova and
Teufel (2010), and Shutova et al. (2013a) ex-
panded upon MIP. Steen (2010) discussed the
strengths and weaknesses of MIP, and intro-
duced the Metaphor Identification Procedure VU
University Amsterdam (MIPVU). Shutova and
Teufel (2010) and and Shutova et al. (2013a)
added a procedure for identifying underlying con-
ceptual mappings between source and target do-
mains.
So far, these presented schemes do not distin-
guish between degrees of metaphoricity, and were
not specifically designed for considering moti-
vations behind metaphor use. Unlike the anno-
tation schemes described above, Klebanov and
Flor (2013) built a metaphor annotation proto-
col for metaphors relevant to arguments in essays.
They were interested in identifying metaphors that
stand out and are used to support the writer’s ar-
gument. Instead of giving a formal definition of
a literal sense, the annotators were instructed to
mark words they thought were used metaphori-
cally, and to write down the point being made
by the metaphor, given a general definition of
metaphor and examples. Our work is similar to
this work in that both corpus studies pay attention
to motivations behind metaphor use. However,
our work focuses on more conversational discus-
sion data whereas they focused on essays, which
are more well-formed.

3 Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996925725">
We conducted experiments using data from three
different web forums including a Massive Open
Online Course (MOOC), a breast cancer support
group (Breastcancer), and a forum for street gang
members (Gang). We randomly sampled 21 posts
(100 sentences) from MOOC, 8 posts (103 sen-
tences) from Breastcancer and 44 posts (111 sen-
tences) from Gang.
We chose these three forums because they all
offer conversational data and they all differ in
terms of the social situation. The forums dif-
fer significantly in purpose, demographics and
the participation trajectory of members. There-
fore, we expect that people will use language dif-
ferently in the three sets, especially related to
metaphorical expressions.
MOOC: This forum is used primarily for task-
based reasons rather than socializing. People par-
ticipate in the forum for a course, and leave when
the course ends. As a result, the forum does
not have continuity over time; participants do not
spend long time with the same people.
Breastcancer: People join this forum for both
task-based and social reasons: to receive informa-
tional and emotional support. People participate
in the forum after they are diagnosed with cancer,
and may leave the forum when they recover. This
forum is also used episodically by many users, but
a small percentage of users stay for long periods
of time (2 or more years). Thus, continuity al-
lows shared norms to develop over years centered
around an intense shared experience.
Gang: In this forum, members belong to a dis-
tinct subculture prior to joining, whereas Breast-
cancer and MOOC members have less shared
identity before entering the forum. This forum
is purely social. There is no clear endpoint for
participation; members leave the forum whenever
they are not interested in it any more. Users may
stay for a week or two, or for years.

4 Qualitative Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999378352941177">
Metaphors can be used for a number of conver-
sational purposes such as increasing or decreas-
ing social distance or as a tactic of persuasion or
manipulation (Ritchie, 2013). In this section, we
perform a qualitative analysis on how metaphor
functions in our data. We illustrate some exam-
ples from each domain with an analysis of how
some functions of social positioning are observed.
The choice of metaphor may reflect something
about the attitude of the speaker. For example,
journey is a metaphor frequently used in the breast
cancer support discussion forum1 as seen in exam-
ples (2) – (5) from the Breastcancer forum. Peo-
ple compare chemotherapy to a journey by using
metaphors such as journey, road and moves along.
A journey has a beginning and a goal one trav-
els towards, but people may take different paths.

This conveys the experience of cancer treatment
as a process of progressing along a path, strug-
gling and learning, but allows for each person’s
experience to differ without judgment of personal
success or failure (Reisfield and Wilson, 2004).
By contrast, another common metaphor compares
cancer treatment to battles and war. This metaphor
instead conveys an activity rather than passivity, a
struggle against a defined foe, which can be won
if one fights hard enough. But it also creates neg-
ative connotations for some patients, as forgoing
treatment could then be seen as equivalent to sur-
render (ibid.).

I only deal with one.
In addition, using metaphors can have an ef-
fect of increasing empathetic understanding be-
tween the participants (Ritchie, 2013). We can
see this in examples (1) – (4), where participants
in the same thread use similar metaphors relat-
ing chemotherapy to a journey. Reusing each
other’s metaphors reduces emotional distance and
helps to build empathic understanding and bond-
ing through a shared perception of their situations.
Metaphor also serves to suggest associations
between things that one would not normally asso-
ciate. Example (5) from the MOOC forum frames
participation in discussions as stepping into an
arena, which refers to an area for sports or com-
petition. By making such an analogy, it conveys
an environment of direct competition in front of a
large audience. It suggests that a student may be
afraid of contributing to discussion because they
may make a wrong statement or weak argument
and another person could counter their contribu-
tions, and they will be embarrassed in front of
their classmates.

<bodyText confidence="0.997923692307692">
Metaphors can also be used simply as a form of
wordplay, to display one’s wit and creativity. This
can be seen in the exchange in examples (6) – (8),
from the Gang forum. A common metaphor used
on that forum is to refer to someone as food to
mean that they are weak and unthreatening. The
writer in (6) expands on this metaphor to suggest
that the other person is especially weak by calling
him dessert, while the writer in (7) then challenges
him to fight by exploiting the meaning of hungry
as “having a desire for food”. The first writer (8)
then dismisses him as not worth the effort to fight,
as he does not eat vegetables.

5 Our Annotation Scheme
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999774416666667">
When we performed qualitative analysis as in Sec-
tion 4, we found that more noticeable metaphors
such as “journey”, “pick you up”, and “fall” in (1)
and (2) seem more indicative of speaker attitude
or positioning than metaphors such as “point” in
(5). This might suggest the degree of metaphoric-
ity affects how metaphors function in discourse.
In this section, we describe our metaphor anno-
tation scheme, which tries to map this variation
among metaphors to a simpler three-point scale of
nonliteralness: nonliteral, conventionalized, and
literal.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.979147">
5.1 Basic Conditions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9989355">
Our annotation scheme targets language satisfying
the following three conditions:
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.967778">
4
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.997105375">
1. the expression needs to have an original es-
tablished meaning.
2. the expression needs to be used in context to
mean something significantly different from
that original meaning.
3. the difference in meaning should not
be hyperbole, understatement, sarcasm or
metonymy
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999740434782609">
These conditions result in metaphorical ex-
pressions including simile and metaphorical id-
ioms. We consider simile to be a special case of
metaphor which makes an explicit comparison us-
ing words such as “like”. We include metaphor-
ical idioms because they are obviously nonliteral
and metaphorical despite the fact that they have
lost their source domains.
Have an original meaning: The expression or
the words within the expression need to have orig-
inal established meanings. For example, in the
sentence “I will be joining you on your journey
this month” of (1) in Section 4, the word “journey”
refers to chemotherapy given the context, but has
a clear and commonly known original meaning of
a physical journey from one place to another.
Alter the original and established meanings
of the words: The usage needs to change the orig-
inal meaning of the expression in some way. The
intended meaning should be understood through
a comparison to the original meaning. For the
same example, in “I will be joining you on your
journey this month”, the intended meaning can be
understood through a comparison to some char-
acteristics of a long voyage. For metaphorical id-
ioms such as “he kicked the bucket,” the nonliteral
meaning of “he died” is far from the literal mean-
ing of “he struck the bucket with his foot.”
Should not merely be hyperbole, understate-
ment, sarcasm, or metonymy: To reduce the
scope of our work, the usage needs to alter the
original meaning of the expression but should not
simply be a change in the intensity or the polar-
ity of the meaning, nor should it be metonymy.
Language uses like hyperbole and understatement
may simply change the intensity of the meaning
without otherwise altering it. For sarcasm, the
intended meaning is simply the negation of the
words used. Metonymy is a reference by asso-
ciation rather than a comparison. For example, in
“The White House denied the rumor”, the White
House stands in for the president because it is as-
sociated with him, rather than because it is being
compared to him. Note that metaphorical expres-
sions used in conjunction with these techniques
will still be coded as metaphor.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998535">
5.2 Decision Steps
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999703">
To apply the basic conditions to the actual annota-
tion procedure, we come up with a set of decision
questions (Table 1). The questions rely on a va-
riety of other syntactic and semantic distinctions
serving as filtering questions. An annotator fol-
lows the questions in order after picking a phrase
or word in a sentence he or she thinks might be
nonliteral language. We describe some of our de-
cisions below.
Unit: The text annotators think might be non-
literal is considered for annotation. We allow a
word, a phrase, a clause, or a sentence as the
unit for annotation as in (Wallington et al., 2003).
We request that annotators include as few words
as necessary to cover each metaphorical phrase
within a sentence.
Category: We request that annotators code a
candidate unit as nonliteral, conventionalized, or
literal. We intend the nonliteral category to in-
clude nonliteral language usage within our scope,
namely metaphors, similes, and metaphorical id-
ioms. The conventionalized category is intended
to cover the cases where the nonliteralness of the
expression is unclear because of its extensive us-
age. The literal category is assigned to words that
are literal without any doubt.
Syntactic forms: We do not include prepo-
sitions or light verbs. We do not consider
phrases that consist of only function words such
as modals, auxiliaries, prepositions/particles or
infinitive markers. We restrict the candidate
metaphorical expressions to those which contain
content words.
Semantic forms: We do not include single
compound words, conventional terms of address,
greeting or parting phrases, or discourse markers
such as “well”. We also do not include termi-
nology or jargon specific to the domain being an-
notated such as “twilight sedation” in healthcare,
since this may be simply borrowing others’ words.

In addition, we used Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing marketplace to col-
lect laypeople’s recognition of metaphors. We
employed MTurk workers to annotate each sen-
tence with the metaphorical expressions. Each
sentence was given along with the full post it came
from. MTurkers were instructed to copy and paste
all the metaphors appearing in the sentence to
given text boxes. They were given a simple def-
inition of metaphor from Wikipedia along with a
few examples to guide them. Each sentence was
labeled by seven different MTurk workers, and we
paid $0.05 for annotating each sentence. To con-
trol annotation quality, we required that all work-
ers have a United States location and have 98%
or more of their previous submissions accepted.
We monitored the annotation job and manually
filtered out annotators who submitted uniform or

value between trained annotators and MTurkers.
The agreement between trained annotators and
MTurkers was 0.51 for N and 0.40 for N + C. We
can see the agreement between trained annotators
and MTurkers is not that bad especially for N.
Figure 1 shows the percentage of words labeled
as N, C or L according to the number of MTurk-
ers who annotated the word as metaphorical. As

the more likely it was to be annotated as N or C
by our trained annotators. The distinction between
Nonliteral and Conventionalized, however, is a bit
muddier, although it displays a moderate trend to-
wards more disagreement between MTurkers for
the Conventionalized category. The vast majority
of words (&gt;90%) were considered to be literal, so
the sample size for comparing the N and C cate-
gories is small.

7 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999658">
In this section, we investigate the disagreements
between annotators. A problem inherent to the an-
notation of metaphor is that the boundary between
literal and nonliteral language is fuzzy. Different
annotators may draw the line in different places
even when it comes to phrases they are all famil-
iar with. It is also true that each person will have
a different life history, and so some phrases which
are uninteresting to one person will be strikingly
metaphorical to another. For example, someone
who is unfamiliar with the internet will likely find
the phrase “surf the web” quite metaphorical.
Since we did not predefine the words or phrases
that annotators could consider, there were often
cases where one person would annotate just the

noun and another might include the entire noun
phrase. If it was part of a conventional multi-word
expression, MTurkers seemed likely to include the
entire collocation, not merely the metaphorical
part. Boundaries were an issue to a lesser extent
with our trained annotators.
One of our datasets, the Gang forum, uses a lot
of slang and non-standard grammar and spellings.
One of our trained annotators is quite familiar with
this forum and the other is not. This was the set
they had the most disagreement on. For exam-
ple, the one annotator did not recognize names of
certain gangs and rap musicians, and thought they
were meant metaphorically. Similarly, the MTurk-
ers had trouble with many of the slang expressions
in this data.
Another issue for the MTurkers is the distinc-
tion between metaphor and other forms of nonlit-
eral language such as metonymy and hyperbole.
For example, in the Gang data, the term “ass” is
used to refer to a whole person. This is a type
metonymy (synecdoche) using a part to refer to
the whole. MTurkers were likely to label such
expressions as metaphor. Hyperbolic expressions
like “never in a million years” were also marked
by some MTurkers.
In a few cases, the sentence may have required
more context to decipher, such as previous posts
in the same thread. Another minor issue was that
some data had words misspelled as other words or
grammatical errors, which some MTurkers anno-
tated as metaphors.
Certain categories of conventionalized
metaphors that would be annotated in the
original presentation of MIP (Pragglejaz-Group,
2007) were never or almost never annotated by
MTurkers. These included light verbs such as
”make” or ”get” when used as causatives or
the passive “get”, verbs of sensation used for
cognitive meanings, such as “see” meaning “un-
derstand”, and demonstratives and prepositions in
themselves. This may indicate something about
the relevance of these types of metaphors for
certain applications.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984972222222">
We annotated data from three distinct conver-
sational online forums using both MTurks and
our annotation scheme. The comparison between
these two annotations revealed a few things. One
is that MTurkers did not show high agreement
among themselves, but showed acceptable agree-
ment with trained annotators for the N category.
Another is that domain-specific knowledge is im-
portant for accurate identification of metaphors.
Even trained annotators will have difficulty if they
are not familiar with the domain because they may
not even understand the meaning of the language
used.
Our annotation scheme has room for improve-
ment. For example, we need to distinguish be-
tween the Conventionalized and Nonliteral cate-
gories more clearly. We will refine the coding
scheme further as we work with more annotators.
We also think there may be methods of pro-
cessing MTurk annotations to improve their cor-
respondence with annotations based on our cod-
ing scheme. This could address issues such as in-
consistent phrase boundaries or distinguishing be-
tween metonymy and metaphor. This could make
it possible to use crowdsourcing to annotate the
larger amounts of data required for computational
applications in a reasonable amount of time.
Our research is in the beginning phase work-
ing towards the goal of computational modeling
of social and discourse uses of metaphor. Our next
steps in that direction will be to work on develop-
ing our annotated dataset and then begin to investi-
gate the differing contexts that metaphors are used
in. Our eventual goal is to be able to apply compu-
tational methods to interpret metaphor at the level
of social positioning and discourse functions.

To computationally model discourse and social positioning in metaphor, we need a corpus annotated with metaphors relevant to speaker intentions. This paper reports a corpus study as a first step towards computational work on social and discourse functions of metaphor. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to annotate data from three web discussion forums covering distinct domains. We then compare these to annotations from our own annotation scheme which distinguish levels of with the labels: conand Our hope is that this work raises questions about what new work needs to be done in order to address the question of how metaphors are used to achieve social goals in interaction.</abstract>

People use metaphorical expressions in a variety of ways in order to position themselves socially and express attitudes, as well as to make their point more effective, attractive, and convincing. Metaphors can be used to describe unfamiliar situations and feelings when the speaker feels that literal description is inadequate. They can also be used to display the speaker’s creativity and wit. They can further be used as a tactic for persuasion or manipulation by foregrounding aspects that would not ordinarily be relevant. Cameron (2007) shows that we can understand social interactions and their contexts better by closely looking at these patterns of metaphor use. Metaphors can vary in how conventionalized they are, from those which have lost their original concrete meanings to completely novel and vivid metaphors. Intuitively, it also makes sense that metaphors which are more conventional and less obviously metaphorical will be used with less conscious thought than more novel or vivid metaphors. There are thus reasons to suspect that distinguishing between levels of metaphoricity could give insight into patterns of use. In t</context>

They showed a moderate-to-strong correlation between percentage of metaphorically used words in an essay and the writing quality score. We will introduce their annotation protocol in Section 2.2. However, to the best of our knowledge, not much computational work has been done on understanding the motivation behind the use of metaphor besides that of Klebanov and Flor (2013).

They were interested in identifying metaphors that stand out and are used to support the writer’s argument. Instead of giving a formal definition of a literal sense, the annotators were instructed to mark words they thought were used metaphorically, and to write down the point being made by the metaphor, given a general definition of metaphor and examples. Our work is similar to this work in that both corpus studies pay attention to motivations behind metaphor use. However, our work focuses on more conversatio</context>

MTurkers were likely to label such expressions as metaphor. Hyperbolic expressions like “never in a million years” were also marked by some MTurkers. In a few cases, the sentence may have required more context to decipher, such as previous posts in the same thread. Another minor issue was that some data had words misspelled as other words or grammatical errors, which some MTurkers annotated as metaphors. Certain categories of conventionalized metaphors that would be annotated in the original presentation of MIP (Pragglejaz-Group, 2007) were never or almost never annotated by MTurkers. These included light verbs such as ”make” or ”get” when used as causatives or the passive “get”, verbs of sensation used for cognitive meanings, such as “see” meaning “understand”, and demonstratives and prepositions in themselves. This may indicate something about the relevance of these types of metaphors for certain applications. 8 Conclusion We annotated data from three distinct conversational online forums using both MTurks and our annotation scheme.

People compare chemotherapy to a journey by using metaphors such as journey, road and moves along. A journey has a beginning and a goal one travels towards, but people may take different paths. 1http:breastcancer.org 3 This conveys the experience of cancer treatment as a process of progressing along a path, struggling and learning, but allows for each person’s experience to differ without judgment of personal success or failure (Reisfield and Wilson, 2004). By contrast, another common metaphor compares cancer treatment to battles and war. This metaphor instead conveys an activity rather than passivity, a struggle against a defined foe, which can be won if one fights hard enough. But it also creates negative connotations for some patients, as forgoing treatment could then be seen as equivalent to surrender (ibid.). (1) Hello Ladies!

Gang: In this forum, members belong to a distinct subculture prior to joining, whereas Breastcancer and MOOC members have less shared identity before entering the forum. This forum is purely social. There is no clear endpoint for participation; members leave the forum whenever they are not interested in it any more. Users may stay for a week or two, or for years. 4 Qualitative Analysis Metaphors can be used for a number of conversational purposes such as increasing or decreasing social distance or as a tactic of persuasion or manipulation (Ritchie, 2013). In this section, we perform a qualitative analysis on how metaphor functions in our data. We illustrate some examples from each domain with an analysis of how some functions of social positioning are observed. The choice of metaphor may reflect something about the attitude of the speaker. For example, journey is a metaphor frequently used in the breast cancer support discussion forum1 as seen in examples (2) – (5) from the Breastcancer forum.

(4) I split this journey into 4 stages and I only deal with one. In addition, using metaphors can have an effect of increasing empathetic understanding between the participants (Ritchie, 2013). We can see this in examples (1) – (4), where participants in the same thread use similar metaphors relating chemotherapy to a journey. Reusing each other’s metaphors reduces emotional distance and helps to build empathic understanding and bonding through a shared perception of their situations. Metaphor also serves to suggest associations between things that one would not normally associate. Example (5) from the MOOC forum frames participation in discussions as stepping into an arena, which refers to an area for sports or competition.

Section 8 concludes the paper. 2 Relation to Prior Work In this section, we introduce the two main bodies of relevant prior work on metaphor in language technologies: computational metaphor processing and metaphor annotation. 2.1 Computational Work on Metaphor Much of of the computational work on metaphor can be classified into two tasks: automatic identification and interpretation of metaphors. Metaphor identification has been done using different approaches: violation of selectional preferences (Fass, 1991), linguistic cues (Goatly, 1997), source and target domain words (Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2006), clustering (Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Shutova et al., 2010), and lexical relations in WordNet (Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007). Gedigian et al. (2006) and Li and Sporleder (2010) distinguished the literal and nonliteral use of a target expression in text. In addition, Mason (2004) performed source-target domain mappings. Metaphor interpretation is another large part of the computational work on metaphor.

Our work hopefully lays additional foundation for the needed computational work. 2.2 Metaphor Annotation One of the main challenges in computational work on metaphor is the lack of annotated datasets. Annotating metaphorical language is nontrivial because of a lack of consensus regarding annotation schemes and clear definitions. In this section, we introduce some work dedicated to metaphor annotation and a corpus study. Wallington et al. (2003) conducted experiments to investigate what identifies metaphors. Two different teams annotated the same text with different instructions, one asked to label “interesting stretches” and the other “metaphorical stretches”. They also asked annotators to tag words or phrases that indicated a metaphor nearby, in order to investigate signals of metaphoricity. Pragglejaz Group (2007) presented a metaphor annotation scheme, called the Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP), which introduced a systematic approach with clear decision rules. In this scheme, a word is considered to be metaphorical if it </context>

The questions rely on a variety of other syntactic and semantic distinctions serving as filtering questions. An annotator follows the questions in order after picking a phrase or word in a sentence he or she thinks might be nonliteral language. We describe some of our decisions below. Unit: The text annotators think might be nonliteral is considered for annotation. We allow a word, a phrase, a clause, or a sentence as the unit for annotation as in (Wallington et al., 2003). We request that annotators include as few words as necessary to cover each metaphorical phrase within a sentence. Category: We request that annotators code a candidate unit as nonliteral, conventionalized, or literal. We intend the nonliteral category to include nonliteral language usage within our scope, namely metaphors, similes, and metaphorical idioms. The conventionalized category is intended to cover the cases where the nonliteralness of the expression is unclear because of its extensive usage. The literal category is assigned to words that are literal without any doubt. Syntactic form</context>

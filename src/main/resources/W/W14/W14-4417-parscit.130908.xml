If an NLG system needs to be put in
place as soon as possible it is not always
possible to know in advance who the us-
ers of a system are or what kind of in-
formation will interest them. This paper
describes the development of a system
and contextualized text for unknown us-
ers. We describe the development, design
and initial findings with a system for un-
known users that allows the users to de-
sign their own contextualised text.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999869178571429">
Requirements of an NLG system are derived
commonly by analysing a gold standard corpus.
Other knowledge acquisition (KA) techniques
such as interviewing experts and end-users are
also frequently employed. However, when these
KA studies result in only a partial specification
of the system requirements or complications
make carrying out a detailed user study in the
time available difficult, an initial system for un-
known users may need to be developed. The ini-
tial system needs to fulfil the known require-
ments making a number of assumptions to fill the
gaps in the requirements. In this paper, we con-
centrate on the content determination problem
for such a system.
We encountered this particular problem when
producing an initial NLG system to give feed-
back to volunteers submitting information about
signs of American Mink, an invasive species in
Scotland. Our response can be viewed, on one
hand, as that of exposing an early prototype for
evaluation in real use. On the other hand, it can
be viewed as an approach to allowing users to
“design their own contextualised text”. We ex-
pected that this approach would have a number
of advantages. In the paper, we draw our conclu-
sions about how this worked out in our example
application.

2 Background - MinkApp
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99962975">
The Scottish Mink Initiative (SMI) project aims
to protect native wildlife by removing breeding
American Mink (an invasive species) from the
North of Scotland. SMI in the form discussed
here was launched in May 2011 and ran until
August 2013, after which it continued but on a
much smaller funding base. SMI’s success and
future rely on an ongoing network of volunteers
from across Scotland to monitor the American
mink population. During the period from 2011 to
2013, these volunteers were coordinated by 4 and
later 3 full-time Mink Control officers (MCOs)
who had 2.5 year fixed term contracts, had no
communal offices and were geographically lo-
cated across Scotland.
At present volunteers are provided with rafts to
monitor American mink. Rafts are simple devic-
es that float on water and are monitored by vol-
unteers who regularly check a clay pad for mink
footprints. In the past, volunteers in turn reported
signs or lack of signs to their corresponding
MCO. Now volunteers can do the same through
the MinkApp website, introduced in 2012,
though some choose to continue to use the previ-
ous reporting method. The data should ideally be
entered roughly every 10 days; it concerns either
positive or negative records from raft checks, or
visual sightings of mink and actual mink cap-
tures. The records contain geographical infor-
mation and a timestamp. MinkApp checks
whether this data is complete and then informs
the respective mink officer for that volunteer’s
area and enters the data into the database.
Volunteers used to receive a quarterly newsletter
that had some regional specific content but was
not volunteer specific. They could receive spo-
radic contact from their mink control officer in
the form of a phone call or email. MinkApp al-
lowed an infrastructure to be developed to pro-
vide volunteers with specific and immediate

feedback upon submission of their observations
by means of contextualised feedback text.
SMI’s funding base was severely reduced in Au-
gust 2013 and MinkApp has proven central to its
endurance. Volunteer activities of the SMI are
now supported by staff from 10 local rivers and
fisheries trusts (as one of their many activities).
This limited amount of staff time available could
make the development of automatic personalised
feedback generation vital to allow volunteers to
have tailored information on the progress of the
project and to keep volunteers engaged.

3 The Problem - SMI Volunteers: The
Unknown Users
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969319148936">
The nearest to a gold standard for what infor-
mation to offer was the corpus of newsletters
containing information on the project as a whole.
However, we learned that these newsletters were
often not read and we have no way of judging
their level of success. These newsletters, along
with emails and discussions conducted with SMI
employees on their interactions with volunteers,
however, gave us ideas about potential content
that could be selected and indication of potential
lexical structure and word use when addressing
volunteers.
Although some SMI volunteers monitor mink as
part of their job (e.g. gamekeepers), they could in
fact be anyone with a desire to contribute to na-
ture conservation. Volunteers are located in very
disparate geographical locations across Scotland,
with no set gender or age range and so volun-
teers’ motivations, computer skills and profes-
sions are mostly unknown. Because of the range
of types of people who could in principle be vol-
unteers, they can be expected to be very varied.
It is extremely difficult to contact all volunteers
as each SMI catchment is managed and orga-
nized in different ways and volunteers are con-
tacted using different media e.g. mail, email, tel-
ephone, face-to-face. SMI is also careful to avoid
attempting to contact volunteers too often, con-
scious that they are providing their services for
free and should not be bothered unnecessarily.
There is also some uncertainty about which vol-
unteers are active, as records are often partial or
out of date. It is known anecdotally from MCOs
that many volunteers are unwilling to use any
kind of computer system and so it is unclear
what kind of people will be reached through
MinkApp. Finally, most observations of mink
signs that arise are “null records”, i.e. records of
observing no mink prints on rafts. It is not known
which volunteers will be sufficiently motivated
to submit “null records” and which will remain
apparently inactive because they have nothing
positive to report.
So, even though there was a need for automati-
cally generated feedback now, there was a real
question of who the readers would be and how to
select the content to include in the feedback.

<bodyText confidence="0.999887857142857">
A standard approach to establish user require-
ments for NLG is to assemble a corpus of hu-
man-authored texts and their associated inputs
(Reiter &amp; Dale, 2000). This can be the basis of
deriving rules by hand, or one can attempt to rep-
licate content selection rules from the corpus by
machine learning (Duboue &amp; McKeown, 2003;
Konstas &amp; Lapata, 2012). To produce a useful
corpus, however, one has to know one’s users or
have reliable expert authors.
As first pointed out by Levine et al. (1991), an
NLG system that produces hypertext, rather than
straight text, can avoid some content selection
decisions, as the user makes some of these deci-
sions by selecting links to follow. A similar ad-
vantage applies to other adaptive hypertext sys-
tems (Brusilovsky, 2001). Another general pos-
sibility is to allow users to design aspects of the
texts they receive. For instance, ICONOCLAST
(Power, Scott, &amp; Bouayad-Agha, 2003) allows
users to make choices about text style. However,
relatively little is known about how such ap-
proaches work ‘in the wild’.
Various previous work has attempted to build
models of users through observing interactions
with an interface (Fischer, 2001). Alternatively,
it is possible to explicitly ask questions to the
user about their interests (Tintarev &amp; Masthoff,
2008), though this requires the users to have the
time and motivation to take part in an initial ac-
tivity with no direct reward.
Our approach can be seen to have similarities
with hypertext generation, in that we are offering
alternative texts to users, and non-invasive ap-
proaches to user modelling.

5 Approach to Content Selection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999568533333333">
To overcome the ‘unknown’ user and ‘unknown’
feedback problem it was decided to implement a
relatively quick exploratory tool that could be
used to help understand user requirements, pro-
vide initial evaluation of feedback content and
build an understanding of user interests. To
achieve these aims we developed a tool that al-
lows users to generate their own text, selecting
content from a larger set of possibilities. The in-
formation on the type of feedback generated by
the user would allow us to investigate user stere-
otypes, their detection and the automatic adapta-
tion of content based on their interests
(Zancanaro, Kuflik, Boger, Goren-Bar, &amp;
Goldwasser, 2007).

5.1 Exploratory Tool - The Feedback Form
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999936037037037">
The feedback form (Figure 1) is displayed to us-
ers of the MinkApp system once they have sub-
mitted a raft check. The form allows the user to
select which raft they wish to have their feedback
generated on from a list of the rafts they manage.
The users have four types of information they
can select to have feedback generated on: Signs
(information on signs of mink reported through
raft checks), Captures (information on mink cap-
tures), My Rafts (information on their personal
raft checks and submission record) and Mink
Ecology (information on mink behaviour and
seasonality).
Two of the four options, Signs and Captures,
allow the user to select to what geographic scale
they would like their feedback based on: the
whole of the SMI project area, their river or their
catchment – the geographical region that they
report to e.g. Aberdeenshire, Tayside etc.
Once the user has made their selection the per-
sonalised feedback based on their choices is gen-
erated and displayed along with an option to rank
how interesting they found this feedback or any
comments they wish to make. The user can gen-
erate multiple texts in one session. All data from
each click of an option, the generated text and
user comments on the text are recorded.

The structure of the text is separated out into

the structure of the generated paragraph is de-

Don catchment there have been 6 signs of mink
reported over the past 12 months which is higher
than the previous 12 months
Additional Information / Motivation – Mink are
coming into your area to replace captured mink.
This shows your area has good ecology for mink
and it is important to keep monitoring.
Personal – There have been no signs of mink (in
the form of either footprints or scat) in the past
30 days. No signs of mink recently does not mean
they are gone - remain vigilant.

To produce the actual content to fill the slots of
the schemas, the system was designed to reason
over geographical location to allow examination
of the various notions of neighbourhood
(Tintarev et al 2012). The system also looks at
temporal trends when developing text based on
the number of record submissions for a given
time. The system initially looks at record sub-
missions in the past week then opens out to a
month, season and finally activity between the
same seasons on different years. This use of
temporal trends ensures volunteers are supplied
with the most relevant (recent) mink activity in-
formation first in busy periods such as the breed-
ing season but ensures ‘cleared’ areas with little
mink activity are still provided with informative
feedback.

6 Evaluation of the Feedback Approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983730769231">
We were initially apprehensive about how much
usage the feedback system would get. MinkApp
was launched through the SMI newsletters, but
we knew that volunteers were not always receiv-
ing or reading these. Also it turned out that the
initial estimate of active volunteers was over-
inflated. Indeed, initially the usage of MinkApp
in general was much lower than was expected.
So we worked hard to promote the system, for
instance asking the fisheries trusts to actively ask
any volunteers they had contact with if they had
heard of MinkApp and to try to use it. As a re-
sult, we did manage to increase the system usage
to a level where some initial conclusions can be
drawn.
MinkApp and specifically the feedback form use
were monitored for 50 days (7 weeks). During
this time 308 raft checks were submitted by vol-
unteers for 98 different rafts by 44 unique users.
The feedback system was used by volunteers to
generate 113 different texts about 36 different
rafts. 32 out of the 44 (72.7%) of all MinkApp
users requested generated feedback at least once.
In 47% of the feedback form use sessions multi-
ple texts were generated and there are some par-
ticularly interesting use patterns:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9984757">
• “Regular explorer”: One user accessed
MinkApp seven times and generated
feedback text on every use: 1 text, 3
texts, 5 texts, 5 texts, 4 texts, 2 texts and
1 text
• “Periodic explorer”: One user accessed
MinkApp six times and generated at
least one feedback text on every second
use
• “Try once only”: The user who accessed
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.982791766666667">
MinkApp the most with eleven different
sessions only generated feedback text on
their first use of MinkApp.
These different patterns of use require further
investigation as the number of users using
MinkApp increases. The patterns can be affected
by idiosyncratic factors. For instance, one volun-
teer informed the project coordinator that they
continually selected Captures within their area as
they had caught a mink and their capture had not
yet been added to the system - the volunteer was
using the feedback form to monitor how long it
took for mink capture data to appear in
MinkApp.
Of the four types of information available to vol-
unteers Signs was the most viewed although
Captures was what SMI staff had felt volunteers
would be most interested in. Signs had 56.6% of
the overall use and catchment was the most
widely selected option for geographic area for
both Signs and Captures. However there was no
clearly predominant second choice for infor-
mation option with Captures and My Rafts hav-
ing only 2.7% of a difference within their use.
Mink Ecology was the least used category, partly
to do with the lack of clarity in the name ‘Mink
Ecology’. Signs on a local geographical scale
were the most common selection for volunteers
but the actual use was not clear enough to sup-
port a fixed text type or removing other options.

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979428571429">
The results of this initial study did support the
value of feedback to volunteers (more directly
than we would have been able to determine in
advance) with 73% of volunteers choosing to
generate feedback. The feedback enabled us to
offer contextualized information to volunteers
quickly, without initial extensive user studies,
which was very important for supporting the
continuation of SMI.
The fact that the volunteer population was rela-
tively unknown meant that there were some un-
pleasant surprises in terms of uptake and interest.
It was necessary to make special efforts to en-
courage participation to get larger numbers.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996687">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853">
When our system gets used over longer periods
we might observe more meaningful patterns of
behaviour.
The patterns of interest we observed were noisy
and were influenced by many contextual factors
meaning there was little potential yet for statisti-
cal analysis or machine learning.

8 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927166666667">
In-depth analysis is required as more volunteers
use MinkApp and the feedback form to fully un-
derstand patterns of behaviour. Additionally
qualitative studies such as interviews with volun-
teers could help explain use and preferences.
These studies could help us improve the feed-
back system and text to better suit the user’s
needs. In the meantime, we have a working sys-
tem that offers choices to users to ‘generate their
own text’ even though we had hoped to be able
to tailor to individual volunteer preferences
sooner.

To produce a useful corpus, however, one has to know one’s users or have reliable expert authors. As first pointed out by Levine et al.

To achieve these aims we developed a tool that allows users to generate their own text, selecting content from a larger set of possibilities. The information on the type of feedback generated by the user would allow us to investigate user stereotypes, their detection and the automatic adaptation of content based on their interests (Zancanaro, Kuflik, Boger, Goren-Bar, &amp; Goldwasser, 2007). 5.1 Exploratory Tool - The Feedback Form The feedback form (Figure 1) is displayed to users of the MinkApp system once they have submitted a raft check. The form allows the user to select which raft they wish to have their feedback generated on from a list of the rafts they manage. The users have four types of information they can select to have feedback generated on: Signs (information on signs of mink reported through raft checks), Captures (information on mink captures), My Rafts (information on their personal raft checks and submission record) and Mink Ecology (information on mink behav</context>

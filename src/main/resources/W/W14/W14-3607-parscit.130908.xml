Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999019434782609">
Recently, Question Answering (QA) has
been one of the main focus of natural lan-
guage processing research. However, Ara-
bic Question Answering is still not in the
mainstream. The challenges of the Arabic
language and the lack of resources have
made it difficult to provide Arabic QA sys-
tems with high accuracy. While low accu-
racies may be accepted for general purpose
systems, it is critical in some fields such as
religious affairs. Therefore, there is a need
for specialized accurate systems that target
these critical fields. In this paper, we pro-
pose Al-Bayan, a new Arabic QA system
specialized for the Holy Quran. The sys-
tem accepts an Arabic question about the
Quran, retrieves the most relevant Quran
verses, then extracts the passage that con-
tains the answer from the Quran and its
interpretation books (Tafseer). Evaluation
results on a collected dataset show that the
overall system can achieve 85% accuracy
using the top-3 results.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999647270833333">
Nowadays, the Web has become the main source
of information where lots of terabytes of data are
added every day in all fields. With this increase
of data on the Web, there is a critical need for ad-
vanced search facilities that satisfy users’ demands
with high accuracy. This leads to several problems:
the first problem is that most of the available search
engines provide users with documents that are rel-
evant to their demands; however, the users should
take the trouble of searching for the answers in-
side each document. This increased the need for
Question Answering (QA) systems that provide the
users with direct answers to their questions. While
great efforts have been made to provide reliable QA
systems for different languages, very few attempts
have been made to investigate QA for the Arabic
language.
The second problem is the quality of the data.
The development of social networks made the users
not only encouraged to search on the Web but also
to post their opinions and knowledge. Although
this is an advantage for sharing knowledge in differ-
ent fields and massively increasing the data on the
Web, it is critical for religious affairs where users
may post untrusted or false information. Observ-
ing the Arabic Web, we found that this problem
is very common for the Holy Quran, where large
amount of incorrect data is published on different
sites which may provide a spurious view of the
Islamic religion.
The third problem is the challenges of the Ara-
bic language. Arabic is highly inflectional and
derivational, which makes its morphological anal-
ysis a complex task. Derivational: where all the
Arabic words have a three or four characters root
verbs. Inflectional: where each word consists
of a root and zero or more affixes (prefix, infix,
suffix). Arabic is characterized by diacritical
marks (short vowels), the same word with dif-
ferent diacritics can express different meanings.
Diacritics are usually omitted which causes ambi-
guity. Absence of capital letters in Arabic is an
obstacle against accurate named entities recogni-
tion. Finally, the lack of Arabic resources, such
as corpora, makes Arabic NLP research more chal-
lenging.
In this paper, we propose our solutions to these
problems. We introduce Al-Bayan: a new Ara-

bic QA system specialized for the Quran. Al-
Bayan aims at understanding the semantics of the
Quran and answering users questions using reliable
Quranic resources. Mainly, we use the Quran and
its interpretation books (Tafseer) of trusted Quranic
scholars as our sources of information. Our main
contribution can be summarized in the following
points:

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.964350254237288">
Our work is related to prior work in both Quranic
research and Question Answering systems.
(a) Quranic Research: Several studies have
been made to understand the Quranic text and ex-
tract knowledge from it using computational lin-
guistics. Saad et al. (2009) proposed a simple
methodology for automatic extraction of concepts
based on the Quran in order to build an ontology. In
(Saad et al., 2010), they developed a framework for
automated generation of Islamic knowledge con-
crete concepts that exist in the holy Quran. Qurany
(Abbas, 2009) builds a Quran corpus augmented
with a conceptual ontology, taken from a recog-
nized expert source ’Mushaf Al Tajweed’. Quranic
Arabic Corpus (Atwell et al., 2011) also builds a
Quranic ontology of concepts based on the knowl-
edge contained in traditional sources of Quranic
analysis, including the sayings of the prophet
Muhammad (PBUH), and the Tafseer books. Khan
et al. (2013) developed a simple ontology for the
Quran based on living creatures including animals
and birds that are mentioned in the Quran in order
to provide Quranic semantic search. AlMaayah et
al. (2014) proposed to develop a WordNet for the
Quran by building semantic connections between
words in order to achieve a better understanding
of the meanings of the Quranic words using tradi-
tional Arabic dictionaries and a Quran ontology.
Other attempts for text-mining the Quran were
proposed such as: QurAna (Sharaf and Atwell,
2012) which is a corpus of the Quran annotated
with pronominal anaphora and QurSim (Sharaf and
Atwell, 2012) which is another corpus for extract-
ing the relations between Quran verses.
b) Question Answering (QA) Systems: Al-
though a large number of QA systems were pro-
posed for the English language such as the work
proposed by Fleischman et al. (2003), Ittycheriah
and Roukos (2006), Kaisser (2012), the Arabic
QA research is still limited in terms of accuracy.
Some Arabic systems have been proposed such
as: QARAB (Hammo et al., 2002) which is a QA
system that takes factoid Arabic questions and at-
tempts to provide short answers. ArabiQA (Bena-
jiba et al., 2007) which is fully oriented to the mod-
ern Arabic language. It also answers factoid ques-
tions using Named Entity Recognition. However,
this system is not completed yet. DefArabicQA
(Trigui et al., 2010) presents a definitional QA sys-
tem for the Arabic language. Arabic QA4MRE
(Trigui et al., 2012) introduced the Arabic language
for the first time at CLEF. This system proposed
a new approach which can answer questions with
multiple answer choices from short Arabic texts.
However, its overall accuracy is 0.19. Also, all
these systems target the modern standard Arabic.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous research
was proposed for the Quranic classical Arabic ques-
tion answering.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999798">
3.1 Preprocessing Operations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992689655172">
Text preprocessing is done by applying morpho-
logical analysis to identify the structure of text
such as: morphemes, roots, affixes, stems, part
of speech (POS) tags, etc. The Arabic language
is, morphologically, one of the most complex and
rich languages. Moreover, the Quranic Arabic is
morphologically more complex, since each word
may have more that one meaning and a word may
have more than one POS tag. Also, the Arabic
text of the Quran is fully diacritized, while most
of the questions are written without diacritics. For
preprocessing, we used MADA (Morphological
Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic) (Habash
et al., 2009) which is one of the most accurate Ara-
bic preprocessing toolkits. MADA can derive ex-
tensive morphological and contextual information
from raw Arabic text, and then use this information
for high-accuracy part-of-speech tagging, diacriti-
zation, lemmatization, disambiguation, stemming,
and glossing in one step. Each term in the input
text will be represented by its stem and POS tag, in
the following format (stem:POS) using Buckwalter
transliteration (Buckwalter, 2002). We remove pro-
nouns, prepositions, conjunctions and other POS
types, since these words are stopwords and must
not affect the information retrieval indexing. In
our system, we apply MADA preprocessing in two
different phases: on the Quran and its Tafseer in
the offline phase, and on the input question in the

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.493891">
3.2.2 Question Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986129032258">
We classify the question to the anticipated type of
the answer. This information would narrow down
the search space to identify the correct answer. The
most straight forward question classification is the
Rule-based approach; where a set of rules is used
to derive the answer type (for example: the answer
of Who/Whom is of type person). The derivation
of expected answer types is often carried out by
means of machine learning approaches, such as the
work of Li and Roth (2002). This task relies on
three parts: taxonomy of answer types into which
questions are to be classified, a corpus of questions
prepared with the correct answer type classification,
and an algorithm that learns to make the actual pre-
dictions given this corpus. We use an SVM classi-
fier for this purpose and construct its training data.
We also introduce a new taxonomy built specially
for our system. More details about our dataset and
taxonomy are mentioned in Section 4.
Unlike Rule-based classifies, our SVM classifier
can classify questions in which the question word
is omitted. For example the two questions: (Where
did Allah talk to Moses?) and (What is the name
of the mountain at which Allah talked to Moses?),
both have the same answer type (Location). How-
ever, the Rule-based classifier cannot determine the
correct answer type of the second question since
the question word (Where) is omitted. Our SVM
classifier, on the other hand, learns that a moun-
tain name is of type location, therefore it correctly
classifies the two questions.

3.3 Information Retrieval (IR)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994619047619">
The preprocessed question is now fed to the In-
formation Retrieval module that retrieves the most
semantically related verses from the Quran and
its interpretation books (Tafseer). Our approach
is based on the explicit semantic analysis ap-
proach (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) that
augments keyword-based text representation with
concept-based features, automatically extracted
from massive human knowledge repositories such
as Wikipedia. However, instead of using Wikipedia
as ontology, we build our Quranic ontology of con-
cepts which classifies the Quran verses according
to their topics. Details of building our Quranic
ontology are shown in Section 4. We use machine-
learning techniques to build a Semantic Interpreter
as in (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) that maps
fragments of natural language text into a weighted
vector of Quranic concepts. Each leaf concept in
the ontology has a list of verses, which are related
to this concept. For each leaf concept Ci, a docu-
ment Di is constructed, where Di is a document
of verses and their Tafseer that belong to Ci. Then
preprocessing on Di is applied and finally an in-
dex on Di is created using Lucene Indexer1. Each
Quranic concept will be represented by a vector of
terms that occur in the corresponding document.
Entries of this vector are assigned weights using
the TFIDF scheme. These weights quantify the
strength of association between terms and concepts.
To speed semantic interpretation, we build an in-
verted index which maps each term into a list of
concepts in which it appears. Using the Semantic
Interpreter in a way similar to that in (Gabrilovich
and Markovitch, 2007), a weighted vector of con-
cepts is generated for each verse in the Quran and
stored in our database. This is done in the offline
phase. Similarly, the vector of the input query is
calculated in the online phase. To select the top-
scoring verses that are semantically related to the
user question we compute the cosine similarity be-
tween the concept vector of the input query and the
concept vector of each verse in the Quran.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subtask of
information extraction, where each proper name in
the input passage - such as persons, locations and
numbers - is assigned a named entity tag. We build
the training data as shown in Section 4, then use it
to feed LingPipe tool2 which constructs the NER
model. The NER model is then used in the online
phase to tag the input text.

Quranic Ontology and Tafseer Books:
We integrated the Quranic Corpus Ontology
(Atwell et al., 2011) and the Qurany Ontology
(Abbas, 2009), to form the Quranic conceptual
ontology that we use in our system. The Quranic
Corpus Ontology uses knowledge representation
to define the key concepts in the Quran, and shows
the relationships between these concepts using
predicate logic. The Qurany Ontology is a tree
of concepts that includes all the abstract concepts
covered in the Quran. It is imported from ’Mushaf
Al Tajweed’ list of topics. This integration was
difficult since we had to resolve the overlapping
between the two ontologies. There were also some
mistakes in the Qurany Concept Tree. So, we had
to manually revise the 1200 concepts and their
verses.
The Holy Quran consists of 6236 verses. In our
Quranic ontology, each verse must be classified
to one or more concepts depending on the
semantics of this verse. After adding Quranic
Corpus ontology, there were 621 verses without
concepts, so we added them under their most
suitable concepts to complete the ontology using a
similarity measure module. This module measures
the similarity between classified and unclassified
verses to determine the concepts of unclassified
verses. Now, our final ontology contains 1217 leaf
concepts and all verses of the Quran. Under each
concept in our ontology, we save the related verses
with their Tafseer, that is used to build the inverted
index. We use two Tafseer books: (Ibn-Kathir,
1370) and (Al-Jaza’iri, 1986), which are two of the
most traditional books used by Islamic scholars. It
is possible to add other books to enrich our corpus
data. We also use the Tafseer books to extract the
candidate answer passages.

these classes to 5 categories and also manually
added a new class for Numbers. We used a book

to tag the numbers in the Quran. Table 1 shows the

5.3 Overall System Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927258064516">
Evaluating our overall system is not an easy task,
since we do not have a gold-standard for the Quran
questions to compare with our results. Humans
have the ability to judge the semantic relatedness
of texts. Human judgments can be considered a
gold standard against which computer algorithms
are evaluated. Therefore, we asked some experts in
Quran to judge our system accuracy. The system
was evaluated by 5 Quran experts, using 59 ques-
tions. The output of our system for each question
was the top-3 answers and the top-5 related verses.
Each expert marked each verse or answer as right
or wrong.
Figure 5 shows some examples of the evaluation
questions with the answers retrieved by Al-Bayan
system. For the first question (Who is the Queen
of Sheba?), although the answer (Bilkis) is not
explicitly mentioned in the Quran, the system was
able to extract the correct answer from the Tafseer
of the related verses. For the second question (How
many months is the period of waiting of widows?),
the system elegantly extracts the complete answer
which includes different conditions of the pregnant
and non-pregnant widows. The third and fourth
questions are examples of definitional questions.
We used the TopN accuracy (Manning et al.,
2008) to evaluate the overall system. TopN accu-
racy of correct answers is calculated as the number
of questions in which at least one of the top N
answer candidates is correct, divided by the total

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988409090909">
In this paper, we proposed a novel Question An-
swering system for the Quran, that takes an Arabic
question as an input and retrieves semantically rele-
vant verses as candidate passages. Then an answer
extraction module extracts the answer from the re-
trieved verses accompanied by their Tafseer. We
also proposed a new taxonomy for Quranic Named
Entities and constructed an Arabic Question Clas-
sifier based on state-of-the-art techniques. Our ini-
tial results evaluated by Quranic experts show the
feasibility of constructing an accurate QA system
specialized for the Quran.
In the future, we plan to explore more complex
questions such as: list-type questions. In order to
improve the accuracy of the system, we plan to use
active learning techniques which are appropriate
when the gold-standard is scarce or expensive to
obtain. Thus, Quran experts can give their feedback
about the answers and the system would learn from
this feedback and improve its results. Finally, we
plan to make the proposed system publicly avail-
able to the research community.

<abstract confidence="0.9997775">Recently, Question Answering (QA) has been one of the main focus of natural language processing research. However, Arabic Question Answering is still not in the mainstream. The challenges of the Arabic language and the lack of resources have made it difficult to provide Arabic QA systems with high accuracy. While low accuracies may be accepted for general purpose systems, it is critical in some fields such as religious affairs. Therefore, there is a need for specialized accurate systems that target these critical fields. In this paper, we propose Al-Bayan, a new Arabic QA system specialized for the Holy Quran. The system accepts an Arabic question about the Quran, retrieves the most relevant Quran verses, then extracts the passage that contains the answer from the Quran and its books Evaluation results on a collected dataset show that the system can achieve using the top-3 results.</abstract>

It is possible to add other books to enrich our corpus data. We also use the Tafseer books to extract the candidate answer passages. NER Data: To train our NER module, we need a new annotated corpus specialized for the Quran. Fortunately, Quranic Arabic corpus provides NE annotations for the Quran. This corpus is a hierarchical concept tree that has about 14 main classes. We mapped these classes to 5 categories and also manually added a new class for Numbers. We used a book called ’Numbers and Ratios in Quran’ (Ali, 2008) to tag the numbers in the Quran. Table 1 shows the final classes and their members.

(a) Quranic Research: Several studies have been made to understand the Quranic text and extract knowledge from it using computational linguistics. Saad et al. (2009) proposed a simple methodology for automatic extraction of concepts based on the Quran in order to build an ontology. In (Saad et al., 2010), they developed a framework for automated generation of Islamic knowledge concrete concepts that exist in the holy Quran. Qurany (Abbas, 2009) builds a Quran corpus augmented with a conceptual ontology, taken from a recognized expert source ’Mushaf Al Tajweed’. Quranic Arabic Corpus (Atwell et al., 2011) also builds a Quranic ontology of concepts based on the knowledge contained in traditional sources of Quranic analysis, including the sayings of the prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and the Tafseer books. Khan et al. (2013) developed a simple ontology for the Quran based on living creatures including animals and birds that are mentioned in the Quran in order to provide Quranic semantic search.

The Quranic Corpus Ontology uses knowledge representation to define the key concepts in the Quran, and shows the relationships between these concepts using predicate logic. The Qurany Ontology is a tree of concepts that includes all the abstract concepts covered in the Quran. It is imported from ’Mushaf Al Tajweed’ list of topics. This integration was difficult since we had to resolve the overlapping between the two ontologies. There were also some mistakes in the Qurany Concept Tree. So,</context>

However, the Rule-based classifier cannot determine the correct answer type of the second question since the question word (Where) is omitted. Our SVM classifier, on the other hand, learns that a mountain name is of type location, therefore it correctly classifies the two questions. 59 3.3 Information Retrieval (IR) The preprocessed question is now fed to the Information Retrieval module that retrieves the most semantically related verses from the Quran and its interpretation books (Tafseer). Our approach is based on the explicit semantic analysis approach (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) that augments keyword-based text representation with concept-based features, automatically extracted from massive human knowledge repositories such as Wikipedia. However, instead of using Wikipedia as ontology, we build our Quranic ontology of concepts which classifies the Quran verses according to their topics. Details of building our Quranic ontology are shown in Section 4. We use machinelearning techniques to build a Semantic Interpreter as in (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) that maps fragments of natural language text into a weighted vector of Quranic concepts. Each leaf concept in the</context>
<context position="14134" citStr="Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007" startWordPosition="2247" endWordPosition="2250"> Di is a document of verses and their Tafseer that belong to Ci. Then preprocessing on Di is applied and finally an index on Di is created using Lucene Indexer1. Each Quranic concept will be represented by a vector of terms that occur in the corresponding document. Entries of this vector are assigned weights using the TFIDF scheme. These weights quantify the strength of association between terms and concepts. To speed semantic interpretation, we build an inverted index which maps each term into a list of concepts in which it appears. Using the Semantic Interpreter in a way similar to that in (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), a weighted vector of concepts is generated for each verse in the Quran and stored in our database. This is done in the offline phase. Similarly, the vector of the input query is calculated in the online phase. To select the topscoring verses that are semantically related to the user question we compute the cosine similarity between the concept vector of the input query and the concept vector of each verse in the Quran. 3.4 Answer Extraction After the relevant verses are retrieved, these verses, their Tafseer and the expected answer type are fed into the Answer Extraction stage to extract the</context>

The NER model is then used in the online phase to tag the input text. 3.4.2 Feature Extraction Once we have the preprocessed question Q tagged with named entities, we divide the relevant verses and their Tafseer into passages such that each passage is a candidate answer. For each candidate answer A, we get the probability of correctness C given the question Q and the candidate answer A. Then, the few candidate answers that have the highest probability of correctness are returned. A set of features are used to calculate the probability of correctness as mentioned by (Wang, 2006), such as: (a) Maximum number of matched words between the input question and the candidate answer. (b) The type of the question’s expected answer if it matches with the extracted named entity in the answer passage in case of factoid questions. (c) Is-A relationship in case of definitional questions, in the form: ’NE’ is a ’description’.

Moreover, the Quranic Arabic is morphologically more complex, since each word may have more that one meaning and a word may have more than one POS tag. Also, the Arabic text of the Quran is fully diacritized, while most of the questions are written without diacritics. For preprocessing, we used MADA (Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic) (Habash et al., 2009) which is one of the most accurate Arabic preprocessing toolkits. MADA can derive extensive morphological and contextual information from raw Arabic text, and then use this information for high-accuracy part-of-speech tagging, diacritization, lemmatization, disambiguation, stemming, and glossing in one step. Each term in the input text will be represented by its stem and POS tag, in the following format (stem:POS) using Buckwalter transliteration (Buckwalter, 2002).

The Quranic Corpus Ontology uses knowledge representation to define the key concepts in the Quran, and shows the relationships between these concepts using predicate logic. The Qurany Ontology is a tree of concepts that includes all the abstract concepts covered in the Quran. It is imported from ’Mushaf Al Tajweed’ list of topics. This integration was difficult since we had to resolve the overlapping between the two ontologies. There were also some mistakes in the Qurany Concept Tree.

This information would narrow down the search space to identify the correct answer. The most straight forward question classification is the Rule-based approach; where a set of rules is used to derive the answer type (for example: the answer of Who/Whom is of type person). The derivation of expected answer types is often carried out by means of machine learning approaches, such as the work of Li and Roth (2002). This task relies on three parts: taxonomy of answer types into which questions are to be classified, a corpus of questions prepared with the correct answer type classification, and an algorithm that learns to make the actual predictions given this corpus. We use an SVM classifier for this purpose and construct its training data. We also introduce a new taxonomy built specially for our system. More details about our dataset and taxonomy are mentioned in Section 4. Unlike Rule-based classifies, our SVM classifier can classify questions in which the question word is omitted.

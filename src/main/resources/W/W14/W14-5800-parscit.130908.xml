Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999081166666667">
The first instance of the Workshop on Lexical and Grammatical Resources for Language Processing (LG-
LP 2014) took place on August 24th in Dublin, in conjunction with COLING 2014. It was co-sponsored
by ASIALEX and endorsed by SIGLEX.
The workshop aimed to bring together members of the language-resource (LR) landscape, focusing
on complex linguistic knowledge that requires linguistic expertise, e.g. on dictionaries, ontologies and
grammars. Such manually-built resources are key to the development of natural language processing
(NLP) tools and applications. We intended to strengthen the cohesion of the scientific ’production chain’
spanning from the construction of LRs to their exploitation in hybrid or symbolic NLP. It is necessary
to increase mutual awareness between researchers along this production chain, regarding their activities,
skills and needs, in view of improving the building processes of the resources, their validation and their
exploitation.
Many linguists are comfortable with descriptive tasks such as checking lexical entries for a given
feature, even if each entry requires analysing or pondering. On the other hand, computer scientists
are familiar with formalization and, usually, with notions such as falsifiability or reproducibility, which
are fundamental to sciences. Combining all these skills is likely to stimulate innovation. The workshop
offered an opportunity of interaction which is required to overcome the compartmentalization between
humanities and sciences, and to intensify co-operation between the two ends of the chain. Researchers
were encouraged to exchange about how they manage to face several challenges:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.994728733333333">
• the context of this production chain requires that they not be content with understanding
phenomena, but also achieve actual production of formalized results;
• resulting resources should reach a reasonable level of verifiability, e.g. by finding formal or
syntactic bases as a support to semantic description;
• methods which are able to cover the most diverse languages are to be preferred;
• the format of manual construction of complex LRs must be highly readable, so that errors can be
easily detected and corrected;
• conceptual models are not easy to assign to large amounts of language data; due to idiosyncratic
behaviour of lexical entries, it is often required to manually examine them individually as regards
syntax or semantics;
• many multiword expressions, including support-verb constructions, are somewhere halfway
between compositional and non-compositional constructs;
• actual implementation of NLP systems and real-world applications may provide feedback on
complex lexical and grammatical LRs used in them, but experimentation is required to accurately
relate features of the LRs with features of results obtained in NLP.

We received 31 submissions and accepted 19: an acceptance rate of 61%. We scheduled 10 papers for
oral presentation and 9 as posters. The workshop closed with a general discussion.
We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We would also
like to thank the authors for their valuable contributions.

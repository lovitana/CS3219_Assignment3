Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999315411764706">
In this paper we describe how we mine in-
teractions between a human guide and a
human visitor to build a virtual guide. A
virtual guide is an agent capable of fulfill-
ing the role of a human guide. Its goal is
to guide visitors to each booth of a virtual
fair and to provide information about the
company or organization through interac-
tive objects located at the fair.
The guide decides what to say, using a
graph search algorithm, and decides how
to say using generation by selection based
on contextual features. The guide decides
where to speak at the virtual fair by creat-
ing clusters using a data classification al-
gorithm to learn in what positions the hu-
man guide decided to talk.

1 Introduction and previous work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971459016394">
Fairs are spaces where companies that offer simi-
lar products and services meet to promote them. A
virtual fair emulates a real fair and can be available
before the real fair happens in order to promote it
to its potential visitors.
The virtual fair used in this work is a tourism
fair that took place in Mexico, where visitors could
find in each company’s booth interactive video and
links to tourist companies’ websites promoting
particular products. The goal of the virtual guide
is to walk the user through the virtual fair, provid-
ing information about the companies’ booths and
inviting them to click on interactive objects to ob-
tain more information.
In (Jan et al., 2009) the authors describe a vir-
tual guide used to promote an island in the online
game Second Life whose goal was to provide in-
formation to US army veterans. Our approach dif-
fers to that of (Jan et al., 2009) in that the virtual
guide learns where to speak and how to realize
its contributions from an automatically annotated
corpus, rather than by using manually designed
rules. However, our guide is not able to interpret
utterances from the visitor, its decisions are only
based on the visitor behavior. Natural language
generation is achieved by adapting the generation
by selection method described in (Benotti and De-
nis, 2011a; Benotti and Denis, 2011b).
The generation by selection method affords the
use of complex and human-like sentences, and
it does not need rule writing by a dialogue ex-
pert or manual annotations, among other of their
many advantages. The disadvantage of corpus
based generation is that the resulting dialogue may
not be fully coherent. Shawar and Atwell (2003;
2005) present a method for learning pattern match-
ing rules from corpora in order to obtain the
dialogue manager for a chatbot. Gandhe and
Traum (2007a; 2007b) investigate several dia-
logue models for negotiating virtual agents that are
trained on an unannotated human-human corpus.
Both approaches report that the dialogues obtained
by these methods are still to be improved because
the lack of dialogue history management results
in incoherence. Since in task-based systems, the
dialogue history is restricted by the structure of
the task, the absence of dialogue history manage-
ment is alleviated by tracking the current state of
the task.
In Section 2 we introduce the corpus used by
this work. We discuss the clustering method used
on the corpus in Section 3; the clustering is used
to decide where to speak. After that, we describe
in Section 4 the mechanisms for instruction gener-
ation and graph search used to guide the visitors.
Later, in Section 5 we show the results obtained
in the evaluation process and compare our sys-
tem’s performance with other virtual instructors.
Finally, in Section 6 we elaborate a conclusion
about the virtual guide performance and capabili-
ties, as well as discuss the possible improvements.

2 Virtual guide human-human corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999558714285714">
We collected a corpus using a human guide in a
wizard of Oz setup (Kelley, 1983). The corpus is
comprised by 5 correct sessions in total performed
by the same virtual tour guide, and according to
the desired behavior and actions as specified for
both participants. We recorded 2 hours and 2 min-
utes of virtual fair guided visits which produced
a total of 136 utterances, having employed 18.02
words and 89.29 characters in average per utter-
ance. 9 different interactive objects were clicked
located in 4 different booths in average per ses-
sion. In Figure 1 we show an aerial view of the vir-
tual fair and the occurrence of utterances, marked
in blue.

3 Behavior-based utterance clustering
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954225806452">
The generation by selection method that we use in
this work is based on contextual features, in partic-
ular it is based on the position of the visitor inside
the virtual fair and the actions that are affordable
from that region in the fair. Deciding whether two
positions in the fair have the same affordances, or,
as we call it, fall into the same region is critical to
select appropriate utterances from the corpus de-
pending on the guide’s location and task progress.
The discretization employed in (Benotti and
Denis, 2011a) was geometrical discretization, di-
viding the world in regions based on the area vis-
ible to the guide. Instead of doing a geometri-
cal discretization our virtual fair discretization was
behavior-oriented which means that regions are
delimited by clustering utterances that were ut-
tered in a close position from each other. In the
corpus utterances tend to cluster around decision
points, locations there is more than one affordable
and salient action available to the user and when
the help and direction of the guide is required.
Geometrical region identification based on vis-
ibility normally requires a larger corpus in order
to get a correct utterance generation, because the
chance of having a region without any utterance
occurrence inside is higher. In such discretiza-
tion, different regions may contain a very differ-
ent number of utterances while using behavior-
oriented discretization results in regions with a
similar number of utterances each. That is why
the behavior-oriented discretization is an advan-
tage for our virtual guide, since our corpus is con-
siderably smaller to that used in (Benotti and De-
nis, 2011a).
We ran a modified version of the k-means clus-
tering algorithm (Pakhira, 2009) that avoids empty
clusters over our corpus to group instructions. As
paraphrase instructions, while performing a task,
occur in a same decision point, then we wanted
close instructions to be in the same cluster, and
therefore our criteria of “similarity” between them
was euclidean distance. Ideally, different decision
points should be in different clusters to guarantee
selected utterances are appropriate in every situa-
tion.
Let us visualize virtual fair as a directed graph
(V, E) where V = regions, and if a, b ∈ V
then (a, b) ∈ E if and only if there is at least
one utterance in the corpus whose immediate re-
action was moving from region a to the region b.
If we choose a low number of clusters the k-means
clustering algorithm would cluster instructions of
different nature, and conversely a too high value
would make the virtual fair disconnected. Then, to
obtain an optimal clustering -and therefore an op-
timal discretization- we maximize the k parameter
such that the virtual fair’s graph is still connected.
Discretization is finally obtained by matching
every position (x, y) in the environment to the
nearest cluster’s centroid. We show in Figure 2 the
virtual fair discretized in k = 22 regions, as that
number was the maximum number of clusters we

could reach without breaking the graph connectiv-
ity. Regions are delimited by lines and centroids
are represented by white squares.

<bodyText confidence="0.999847294117647">
The virtual guide must direct visitors through the
fair to interactive objects in order to complete its
promotion duty in each visit session. We show in
Figure 3 a situation in which a visitor is near an
interactive object and the virtual guide encourages
him/her to click it generating an utterance whose
translation is “If you click on the green cube you
will access Lawson’s website where you can learn
more about them and the communication services
they offer”.
We can see the use of a referring expression, a
negative politeness strategy (Brown and Levinson,
1987) to suggest an action but not impose it while
some information about the Lawson firm is given.
In subsection 4.1 we discuss about the corpus
automatic annotation. Then we describe how ut-
terances are selected in subsection 4.2.

4.1 Corpus annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992304181818182">
Our annotation process was simpler and more
straightforward than (Benotti and Denis, 2011a),
where artificial intelligence planning is used to
normalize reactions, mainly due to the fact that
users can not change the virtual fair state during
their visit, they can only change their own posi-
tion and visibility area (defined by the orientation
in the virtual fair) and manipulate interactive ob-
jects.
In a virtual fair visit, the set of user’s relevant
actions are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999969666666667">
• Move from one region to another
• Change orientation to left or right
• Click on an interactive object
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.814134">
Consequently, the set of atoms representing a
virtual fair’s state was simplified to
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999042">
• user-region(region)
• user-orientation(x,y,z,w)1
• clicked(anInteractiveObject)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909142857143">
In short, to do automatic annotation on the vir-
tual guide’s corpus, it was sufficient to observe the
subsequent action to each utterance by looking for
a change on any of the atoms shown above, and
annotating and associating the corresponding reac-
tion to the utterance and the valid atoms set when
it was said.

<bodyText confidence="0.999757916666667">
The virtual guide’s goal is to make the visitor visit
a number of given objectives, namely a set of
stands and interactive objects. Using the virtual
fairs discretization and taking the directed graph
representation we presented in Section 3, the vir-
tual guide uses the A* algorithm to obtain a path,
that is a sequence of actions, from its current po-
sition to the region where the next objective is lo-
cated. In case the visitor got lost or simply took
an alternative path, the virtual guide recalculates
the shortest path and proceeds to guide the visitor
through it.

<bodyText confidence="0.999703769230769">
Clearly, in order to do this calculation it is criti-
cal that every objective is reachable from any node
in the graph, so choosing a k parameter in the dis-
cretization process must be done taking care of
that.
The virtual guide gives the visitor a new instruc-
tion depending on next actions to perform using
the selection algorithm taken from (Benotti and
Denis, 2011a), shown in Algorithm 1. The al-
gorithm obtains set of utterances C, all of which
have a reaction that corresponds to the sequence
of actions that the virtual guide wants the visitor
to perform next.

where we previously supposed the virtual guide
would have better results than other virtual instruc-
tors, if we consider the results showed in (Benotti
and Denis, 2011a).
We compared our virtual guide results with the
two best symbolic systems built for another vir-
tual environment, the GIVE-2 Challenge. Those
systems were NA from INRIA and SAAR from
University of Saarland (see (Koller et al., 2010)).
Furthermore, we checked if the virtual guide re-
sults were similar to another virtual instructor, also
built for GIVE-2, called OUR, in which generation
by selection was applied to make natural language
generation possible.
In Table 1 we show the results for each virtual
instructor in the three categories we are interested.
We can see that the virtual guide obtained signif-
icantly better results than the SAAR and NA and
in questions S1, S2 and S3, as we had supposed.
All three questions range from 1 (one) to 9 (nine),
the lower the number the better the system (since
questions are negative).

6 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999767846153846">
In this paper we described the construction of a
virtual guide for a virtual fair with the purpose of
guiding visitors through the stands and to interac-
tive objects located inside the fair. Inmersive vir-
tual fairs and expositions constitute a promising
way to promote such events.
On our evaluation, the virtual guide had com-
parable results than the virtual instructor GIVE-2
implemented using generation by selection, using
a much smaller corpus. Our guide got better re-
sults that the two best performing symbolic sys-
tems. These results are preliminary, but also en-
couraging.
A possible extension of this work could be that
virtual guide can continue to improve its behavior
by learning online when input from a human guide
of the fair is available. If more corpus is available
in this way the virtual guide could discard those
utterances that do not lead most visitors to perform
the intended reaction.
As a result of this work we conclude that vir-
tual guide met the basic functions of navigation
and natural language generation that we expected
and that the resulting prototype is ready to be
deployed at the virtualization of events website

Deciding whether two positions in the fair have the same affordances, or, as we call it, fall into the same region is critical to select appropriate utterances from the corpus depending on the guide’s location and task progress. The discretization employed in (Benotti and Denis, 2011a) was geometrical discretization, dividing the world in regions based on the area visible to the guide. Instead of doing a geometrical discretization our virtual fair discretization was behavior-oriented which means that regions are delimited by clustering utterances that were uttered in a close position from each other. In the corpus utterances tend to cluster around decision points, locations there is more than one affordable and salient action available to the user and when the help and direction of the guide is required. Geometrical region identification based on visibility normally requi</context>

In subsection 4.1 we discuss about the corpus automatic annotation. Then we describe how utterances are selected in subsection 4.2. 4.1 Corpus annotation Our annotation process was simpler and more straightforward than (Benotti and Denis, 2011a), where artificial intelligence planning is used to normalize reactions, mainly due to the fact that users can not change the virtual fair state during their visit, they can only change their own position and visibility area (defined by the orientation in the virtual fair) and manipulate interactive objects. In a virtual fair visit, the set of user’s relevant actions are: • Move from one region to another • Change orientation to left or right • Click on an interactive object Consequently, the set of atoms representing a virtual fair’s state was simplified to • user-region(region) • user-orie</context>

The virtual guide gives the visitor a new instruction depending on next actions to perform using the selection algorithm taken from (Benotti and Denis, 2011a), shown in Algorithm 1.

A virtual fair emulates a real fair and can be available before the real fair happens in order to promote it to its potential visitors. The virtual fair used in this work is a tourism fair that took place in Mexico, where visitors could find in each company’s booth interactive video and links to tourist companies’ websites promoting particular products. The goal of the virtual guide is to walk the user through the virtual fair, providing information about the companies’ booths and inviting them to click on interactive objects to obtain more information. In (Jan et al., 2009) the authors describe a virtual guide used to promote an island in the online game Second Life whose goal was to provide information to US army veterans. Our approach differs to that of (Jan et al., 2009) in that the virtual guide learns where to speak and how to realize its contributions from an automatically annotated corpus, rather than by using manually designed rules. However, our guide is not able to interpret utterances from the visitor, its decisions are only based on the visitor behavior.

We were particularly interested in the questions • S1: I had difficulties identifying the objects that the system described for me • S2: The Utterances sounded robotic • S3: The system was repetitive where we previously supposed the virtual guide would have better results than other virtual instructors, if we consider the results showed in (Benotti and Denis, 2011a). We compared our virtual guide results with the two best symbolic systems built for another virtual environment, the GIVE-2 Challenge. Those systems were NA from INRIA and SAAR from University of Saarland (see (Koller et al., 2010)). Furthermore, we checked if the virtual guide results were similar to another virtual instructor, also built for GIVE-2, called OUR, in which generation by selection was applied to make natural language generation possible. In Table 1 we show the results for each virtual instructor in the three categories we are interested. We can see that the virtual guide obtained significantly better results than the SAAR and NA and in questions S1, S2 and S3, as we had supposed. All three questions range from 1 (one) to 9 (nine), the lower the number the better the system (since questions are negative). </context>

In such discretization, different regions may contain a very different number of utterances while using behaviororiented discretization results in regions with a similar number of utterances each. That is why the behavior-oriented discretization is an advantage for our virtual guide, since our corpus is considerably smaller to that used in (Benotti and Denis, 2011a). We ran a modified version of the k-means clustering algorithm (Pakhira, 2009) that avoids empty clusters over our corpus to group instructions. As paraphrase instructions, while performing a task, occur in a same decision point, then we wanted close instructions to be in the same cluster, and therefore our criteria of “similarity” between them was euclidean distance. Ideally, different decision points should be in different clusters to guarantee selected utterances are appropriate in every situation. Let us visualize virtual fair as a directed graph (V, E) where V = regions, and if a, b ∈ V then (a, b) ∈ E if and only if there is at least one utterance in the corpus wh</context>

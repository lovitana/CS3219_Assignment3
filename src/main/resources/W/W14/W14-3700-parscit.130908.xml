Introduction to TextGraphs-9
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876862068966">
Welcome to TextGraphs, the workshop on Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing. The
ninth edition of the workshop is being organized on October 29, 2014, in conjunction with the Conference
on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2014 in Doha, Qatar.
For the past eight years, the series of TextGraphs workshops have exposed and encouraged the synergy
between the field of Graph Theory and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The mix between the
two started small, with graph theoretical framework providing efficient and elegant solutions for NLP
applications that focused on single documents for part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation
and semantic role labelling, got progressively larger with ontology learning and information extraction
from large text collections, and have reached web scale through the new fields of research that focus on
information propagation in social networks, rumor proliferation, e-reputation, multiple entity detection,
language dynamics learning and future events prediction to name but a few.
The ninth edition of the TextGraphs workshop would be a new step in the series, focused on issues and
solutions for large-scale graphs, such as those derived for web-scale knowledge acquisition or social
networks. We encourage the description of novel NLP problems or applications that have emerged in
recent years which can be addressed with graph-based solutions, as well as novel graph-based methods
that can be applied to known NLP tasks. Continuing to bring together researchers interested in Graph
Theory applied to Natural Language Processing provides an environment for further integration of graph-
based solutions into NLP tasks. A deeper understanding of new theories of graph-based algorithms is
likely to help create new approaches and widen the usage of graphs for NLP applications.
This volume contains papers accepted for presentation at the workshop. We issued calls for regular
papers, short papers, position papers, and demos. After careful review by the program committee, 6
regular papers and 2 short papers were accepted for presentation. The accepted papers address varied
problems – from theoretical and general considerations, to NLP and real-world applications - through
interesting variations to known and also novel graph-based methods.
We are lucky to have two excellent invited speakers for this year’s event. We thank Prof. Mohammed
J. Zaki and Partha Talukdar for their enthusiastic acceptance to our invitation.
Finally, we are thankful to the members of the program committee for their valuable and high quality
reviews. All submissions have benefited from their expert feedback. Their timely contribution was the
basis for accepting an excellent list of papers and making this edition of TextGraphs a success.

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999661">
The sociolinguistic situation in Arabic countries is characterized by diglossia (Ferguson, 1959) :
whereas one variant Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is highly codified and mainly used for writ-
ten communication, other variants coexist in regular everyday’s situations (dialects). Similarly,
while a number of resources and tools exist for MSA (lexica, annotated corpora, taggers, parsers
... ), very few are available for the development of dialectal Natural Language Processing tools.
Taking advantage of the closeness of MSA and its dialects, one way to solve the problem of the
lack of resources for dialects consists in exploiting available MSA resources and NLP tools in
order to adapt them to process dialects. This paper adopts this general framework: we propose a
method to build a lexicon of deverbal nouns for Tunisian (TUN) using MSA tools and resources
as starting material.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976395321428572">
The Arabic language presents both a standard written form and a number of spoken variants (dialects).
While dialects differ from one country to another, sometimes even within the same country, the written
variety (Modern Standard Arabic, MSA), is the same for all the Arabic countries. Similarly, MSA is
highly codified, and used mainly for written communication and formal spoken situations (news, political
debates). Spoken varieties are used in informal daily discussions and in informal written communication
on the web (social networks, blogs and forums). Such unstandardized varieties differ from MSA with
respect to phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon. Linguistic resources (lexica, corpora) and
natural language processing (NLP) tools for such dialects (parsers) are very rare.
Different approaches are discussed in the litterature to cope with Arabic dialects processing. A gen-
eral solution is to build specific resources and tools. For example, (Maamouri et al., 2004) created a
Levantine annotated corpus (oral transcriptions) for speech recognition research. (Habash et al., 2005;
Habash and Rambow, 2006) proposed a system including a morphological analyzer and a generator for
Arabic dialects (MAGEAD) used for MSA and Levantine Arabic. (Habash et al., 2012) also built a
morphological analyzer for Egyptian Arabic that extends an existing resource, the Egyptian Colloquial
Arabic Lexicon. Other approaches take advantage of the special relation (closeness) that exists betweeen
MSA and dialects in order to adapt MSA resources and tools to dialects. To name a few, (Chiang et
al., 2006) used MSA treebanks to parse Levantine Arabic. (Sawaf, 2010) presented a translation system
for handling dialectal Arabic, using an algorithm to normalize spontaneous and dialectal Arabic into
MSA. (Salloum and Habash, 2013) developped a translation system pivoting through MSA from some
Arabic dialects (Levantine, Egyptian, Iraqi, and Gulf Arabic) to English. (Hamdi et al., 2013) proposed
a translation system between Tunisian (TUN) and MSA verbs using an analyser and a generator for both
variants.
Yet if the first kind of approach is more linguistically accurate because it takes into account specificities
of each dialect, building resources from scratch is costly and extremely time consuming. In this paper
we will thus adopt the second approach: we will present a method to automatically build a lexicon for
Tunisian deverbal nouns by exploiting available MSA resources as well as an existing MSA-TUN lexicon

for verbs (Boujelbane et al., 2013). We will use a root lexicon to generate possible deverbal nouns which
will be later filtered through a large MSA lexicon.
This work is part of a larger project that aims at ’translating’ TUN to an approximative form of MSA
in order to use MSA NLP tools on the output of this translation process. The final lexicon for TUN
deverbal nouns will be integrated into a morphological and syntactic parser for TUN.
The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe and compare some morphological aspects
of MSA and TUN, focusing on derivation. We then discuss in section 3 our approach to build a TUN lex-
icon for deverbal nouns from an existing MSA-TUN resource for verbs. Section 4 presents an evaluation
of the results obtained and section 5 proposes some solutions to increase the coverage of the lexicon.

2 Arabic Morphology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.981489615384615">
Arabic words are built following two kinds of morphological operations: templatic and affixational.
Functionally, both operations are used inflectionally or derivationally (Habash, 2010). In templatic mor-
phology, a root and a pattern combine to form a word stem. A root is a sequence of three, four or five
letters that defines an abstract notion while a pattern is a vocalized template which marks where the root
radicals are inserted. To give an example, by combining the root hH~ ¯ f t H1 with the verbal patterns
1a2a3 and ta1a22a3, two verbs are generated : (1) i�J�¯ fataH ’to open’ and (2) i�Ja�K tafattaH ’to bloom’.
Derivation consists in replacing each digit of the pattern by the corresponding letter in the root.
Arabic verbs have ten basic triliteral patterns, which are conventionally noted with the Latin numbers
I, ... , X. and two basic quadriliteral patterns (XI, XII) (Habash, 2010). A verb is the combination of a
root and a pattern.
Many deverbal nouns can be derived from verbs. Nine kind of deverbal nouns (1, 2, 3 ... 9) are defined
in Arabic (Al-Ghulayaini, 2010), each of them corresponds to a semantic relationship between the verb
and the deverbal noun (see table 1).

From the verbs (1) i�Js fataH ’to open’ and (2) i-J&apos;®-K tafattaH ’to bloom’, many deverbal nouns can be
derived, such as, l�� Ai fAtiH ’opener’, hñ.aÓ maftuwH ’opened’ from (1), and 7C: ®:Ó mutfattiH ’ bloom-
ing’, i_&amp;quot; mutfattaH ’blown’ from (2). These deverbal nouns represent thel active and the passive
�
participles of these verbs. They are derived from the same root as the verb, using deverbal patterns
which depend on the verbal pattern. Table 2 shows TUN and MSA patterns of the active and the passive
participles for the first three verbal patterns.
Table 2 is just a sample of a larger table of deverbal nouns (henceforth called TUN-MSA deverbal
table) that defines for every verbal pattern all deverbals which are derived from it in MSA and TUN.

This table has been created by a Tunisian native speaker. Unlike MSA, which defines a unique pattern
for each participle with all verbal patterns, table 2 shows that TUN has often more than one pattern for
participles. However, for some other cases, such as the infinitive forms and nouns of instruments, MSA
defines several nominal patterns. The choice of the nominal pattern depends on the verbal pattern.
The Arabic nominal derivation system is not systematic and depends on the meaning of the verbs.
In fact, for semantic reasons, most Arabic verbs cannot derive all deverbal nouns. The verb is fataH
’open’, for example, cannot produce the noun of place and time. However, i�Js fataH derives the active
and the passive participles l~~ A�¯ fAtiH ’opener’ and hñ�JiÓ maftuwH ’opened’, the noun of instrument

3 Overview of the Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999195">
Our method consists in generating TUN and MSA pairs of deverbal nouns simultaneously: in a first step,
we use the TUN-MSA deverbal table and an existing MSA-TUN dictionary of verbs in order to generate
candidate pairs of deverbal nouns (NOUNMSA, NOUNTUN). These candidates are then filtered on the
MSA side using an available MSA resource.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999277">
3.1 Generating pairs of deverbal nouns
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999768666666667">
As shown in the TUN-MSA deverbal table (Table 2), every verbal pattern in MSA produces several
patterns of deverbal nouns (i.e., pattern IX2 yields for example the infinitive form Ai12i3A3). The same
applies to TUN (i.e., pattern IX yields the infinitive form 12uw3iyy). A total of 54 MSA and 52 TUN
nominal patterns were defined. To generate deverbal lexicon we have used an existing TUN-MSA lexicon
(Boujelbane et al., 2013) of 1500 verbs composed of pairs of the form (PMSA, PTUN) where PMSA and
PTUN are themselves pairs made of a root and a verbal pattern. The TUN side contains 920 distinct pairs
and the MSA side 1,478 distinct pairs. This difference shows that MSA is lexically richer than TUN. For
every pair (a pattern and a root) we combined the root with all the nominal patterns corresponding to the
verbal pattern on both sides (MSA and TUN) as shown in figure 1.

At this point, about twenty morphological and orthographic rules manually predefined are applied on
the generated form in order to produce a lemma. For instance, the second root radical /y/ and /w/ changes
to /ˆy/ for MSA active participle, while the second root radical /w/ changes to /y/ in the TUN side. Another

rule which is common for MSA and TUN requires that the /t/ of the verbal pattern Ai1ta2a3 (VIII) and
all nominal forms which derive from it, change to a /T/ if the first letter on the radical is /S/, /T/, /D/ or
/Z/ : e.g. masdar H. @Q~~ .o@ AiDtirAb becomes H. @Q¢ “@ AiDTirAb ’trouble’.
Following this step, a lexicon of 137,199 nominal entries (NounMSA, NounTUN) was obtained.

3.2 Filtering
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99975">
As it was expected, the generation method described above overgenerates: it can produce correct pairs
as well as wrong pairs. Four cases have been identified:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9996">
1. Both TUN and MSA nouns are correct
2. TUN noun is wrong and MSA noun is correct
3. MSA noun is wrong and TUN noun is correct
4. Both forms are wrong
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6633925">
To give an example from the verbal lexicon entry (is,
can generate these four situations :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.989421285714286">
1. passive participle: (hñ1-&apos;, ÈñÊm×) (maftuwHMSA, maHluwlTUN) ’opened’, both words are cor-
rect.
2. exaggerate form : (hA��Ji, ÈC�g) (fattAHMSA, HallAlTUN), in this case TUN noun is wrong but
the MSA noun is correct ’conqueror’.
�
3. noun of place : (i Ém×) (maftaHMSA, mHallTUN), in this case TUN noun is correct ’shop,
store’ while the MSA noun does not exist. The TUN noun is obtained after the application of the
gemination3 rule. The allows deleting the vowel between the second and the third radical.
4. analogous adjective: (iJ��J�¯, ÈCm×) (ftiyHMSA, miHlAlTUN), both nouns are wrong.
Situations (3) and (4) can be handeled by filtering the MSA part using an MSA resource. In order to
do so, we have used three resources :
• an Arabic corpus made of reports of the French Press Agency (AFP), which contains 1.5 million
word forms. From these words, we have extracted 10, 595 types of nominal lemmas using the
Arabic morphological analyser MADA (Habash et al., 2009). Only pairs that have the MSA noun
in the corpus have been kept. At the end of this stage, we have obtained a lexicon of 20130 entries :
8441 MSA nouns and 2636 TUN nouns.
• an MSA large-scale lexicon SAMA (Graff et al., 2009) containing 36,935 nominal lemmas. Our
resulting lexicon contains 26, 486 entries : 4, 712 TUN nouns and 10, 647 MSA nouns.
• The union of these resources containing 40,172 nominal lemmas. Using this resource, a lexicon
made of 39, 793 was obtained : 5, 017 TUN nouns and 14, 804 MSA nouns. All results are given in
section 4.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998102636363636">
In order to evaluate the resource produced, we used a Tunisian corpus made of 800 sentences. In order
to cover most spoken TUN varieties, the data was obtained from several sources: TV series, political
debates, and a transcribed theater play (Dhouib, 2007). Once manually tokenized and annotated with
morphological information (lemma and part-of-speech tag), the corpus contains 6,123 tokens: 53.8%
(3,295) of them are nouns, among which 52% are deverbals.
We have divided the evaluation corpus into two different sets : a development corpus contaning 300
TUN sentences and a test corpus with 500 sentences.
Two metrics have been used to evaluate the deverbal lexicon produced. The first one is coverage,
which is the part of the deverbal types of the evaluation corpus that are present in the lexicon. The
second one is ambiguity which is the average number of target deverbals for a source deverbal.
There are two sources of ambiguity:

• The verbal lexicon can associate for one input verb many target verbs, for example the TUN verb
úæ~„Ó mý matches with two different MSA verbs úæ�„Ó mý ’to walk’ and I. ëX� ðhb ’to go’. The
ambiguity is more important in the TUN → MSA sense. On average, a TUN pair corresponds to
1.78 MSA pairs, 1.11 in the opposite direction. The maximum ambiguity is equal to four in the
MSA → TUN direction and sixteen in the opposite direction.
• the TUN-MSA deverbal table may define several patterns for a deverbal noun as shown in table 2.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887333333333">
The evaluation4 of the deverbal lexicon on the test set is displayed in Table 3. The table shows that,
without filtering the lexicon coverage is equal to 67.23%. Ambiguity (in the TUN→MSA direction) is
equal to 12.58, which means that, on average, for a TUN deverbal, 12.58 MSA deverbals are produced.
After filtering using AFP corpus, coverage drops to 60.04% and ambiguity to 6.99. Filtering with the
SAMA lexicon yields a coverage of 62.66% and an ambiguity of 7.24. Finally, filtering using AFP U
SAMA, the coverage reaches 65.67% and the whith an ambiguity of 7.35.

As in the verbal lexicon, switching from TUN to MSA is more ambigous than the inverse direction.
Ambiguity rates attests that MSA is lexically richer than TUN. The filtering step helps to significantly
decrease ambiguity, but it also decreases coverage! The best result is the union of AFPUSAMA, which
enables us to obtain the best trade-off.

We have carried out an error analysis on the automatically generated lexical entries. There are three
major causes that can explain a missing target deverbal:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99896375">
1. Absence of the corresponding verb in the verbal lexicon: nouns deriving from a verb that is absent
from the verb lexicon are not produced in the deverbal lexicon.
2. Missing entries in the TUN-MSA deverbal table
3. Missing morphological and orthographic rules.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999186428571429">
In order to estimate the part of missing deverbals that is due to lack of coverage of the verbal lexicon,
we have added verbs that derive missing deverbals of the development corpus. 92 verbal entries have
been added. Table 5 shows results of coverage and ambiguity on the development set. This result,
although artificial allows to compute an upper bound that can be attained with a more complete verbal
lexicon.
As one can see in Table 5, coverage jumps from 66.12% to 87.33% before filtering and from 64.59%
to 84.16% after filtering using AFP U SAMA. The ambiguity rate increases slightly.

5 Root lexicon and pattern correspondance table
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99860995">
The previous section shows that a large portion of errors came from the lack of coverage of the verbal
lexicon. By adding 92 verbal entries, the coverage jumps by about 6%. Among these 92 entries, there
were 28 inexistent roots but for the 64 remaining, the root was already present in the verbal lexicon, we
have just added new patterns to the roots (as the pair did not exist).
Sebsequently, we have divided the verbal lexicon into two independant resources : a root lexicon and
a verbal pattern correspondance table.
The root lexicon is made of pairs of the form (rMSA, rTUN), where rMSA is an MSA root and rTUN
is a TUN root. The root lexicon contains 1,357 entries. The MSA side contains 1,068 distinct roots
and the TUN side 665 ones. 523 entries are composed of the same root on both sides. As in the verbal
lexicon, the ambiguity is higher in the TUN —* MSA direction. On average, a TUN root is paired with
2.07 MSA roots. In the opposite direction, 1.27 roots.
The verbal pattern correspondance table indicates, for a pattern in MSA or TUN, the most frequent
corresponding pattern on the other side.
In this approach, the target pattern is selected by a lookup in the verbal pattern correspondance table
but the target roots are selected by a root lexicon lookup. For each source root, we have combined it
with all the nominal patterns corresponding to each verbal pattern. The target deverbal is made of the
target root given by the lexicon root and the target nominal pattern depends on the target verbal pattern
indicated in the verbal pattern correspondance table as shown in figure 2.
Results of this experiment on the test corpus show that using this method increase greatly the coverage.
Although it also raises the number of generated entries and subsequently ambiguity.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923222222222">
In this paper, we have presented a bilingual lexicon of deverbal nouns between MSA and TUN. Our
method aims to extend an existing TUN verbal lexicon using a table of deverbal patterns to automatically
generate pairs of TUN and MSA deverbal nouns. Several MSA resources were used to filter wrong pairs
generated. The lexicon was evaluated using two metrics: coverage and ambiguity.
The coverage given by our lexicon is about 71%. Ambiguity is slightly high in TUN→MSA direction.
It reaches 8.15. A contextual disambiguation process is therefore necessary for such a process to be of
practical use.
In future work, we plan to include this lexicon into a system of translation from TUN to an approxi-
mative form of MSA which will be parsed using an MSA parser.

<abstract confidence="0.999576545454545">The sociolinguistic situation in Arabic countries is characterized by diglossia (Ferguson, 1959) : whereas one variant Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is highly codified and mainly used for written communication, other variants coexist in regular everyday’s situations (dialects). Similarly, while a number of resources and tools exist for MSA (lexica, annotated corpora, taggers, parsers ... ), very few are available for the development of dialectal Natural Language Processing tools. Taking advantage of the closeness of MSA and its dialects, one way to solve the problem of the lack of resources for dialects consists in exploiting available MSA resources and NLP tools in order to adapt them to process dialects. This paper adopts this general framework: we propose a method to build a lexicon of deverbal nouns for Tunisian (TUN) using MSA tools and resources as starting material.</abstract>

Derivation consists in replacing each digit of the pattern by the corresponding letter in the root. Arabic verbs have ten basic triliteral patterns, which are conventionally noted with the Latin numbers I, ... , X. and two basic quadriliteral patterns (XI, XII) (Habash, 2010). A verb is the combination of a root and a pattern. Many deverbal nouns can be derived from verbs.

Other approaches take advantage of the special relation (closeness) that exists betweeen MSA and dialects in order to adapt MSA resources and tools to dialects. To name a few, (Chiang et al., 2006) used MSA treebanks to parse Levantine Arabic. (Sawaf, 2010) presented a translation system for handling dialectal Arabic, using an algorithm to normalize spontaneous and dialectal Arabic into MSA. (Salloum and Habash, 2013) developped a translation system pivoting through MSA from some Arabic dialects (Levantine, Egyptian, Iraqi, and Gulf Arabic) to English. (Hamdi et al., 2013) proposed a translation system between Tunisian (TUN) and MSA verbs using an analyser and a generator for both variants. Yet if the first kind of approach is more linguistically accurate because it takes into account specificities of each dialect, building resources from scratch is costly and extremely time consuming. In this paper we will thus adopt the second approach: we will present a method to automatically build a lexicon for Tunisi</context>

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.989361944444444">
People acquire language through social interaction. Computers learn linguistic models from data, and
increasingly, from language-based exchange with people. How do computational linguistic techniques
and interactive visualizations work in concert to improve linguistic data processing for humans and
computers? How can statistical learning models be best paired with interactive interfaces? How can the
increasing quantity of linguistic data be better explored and analyzed? These questions span statistical
natural language processing (NLP), human-computer interaction (HCI), and information visualization
(Vis), three fields with natural connections but infrequent meetings. Vis and HCI are niches in NLP;
Vis and HCI have not fully utilized the statistical techniques developed in NLP. This workshop aims to
assemble an interdisciplinary community that promotes collaboration across these fields.
Three themes define this first workshop:
Active, Online, and Interactive Machine Learning Statistical machine learning (ML) has yielded
tremendous gains in coverage and robustness for many tasks, but there is a growing sense that additional
error reduction might require a fresh look at the human role. Presently, human inputs are often restricted
to passive annotation in ML research. However, the fields of ML and HCI are both developing new
techniques—such as active learning, incremental/online learning, and crowdsourcing—that attempt to
engage people in novel and productive ways. How do we jointly solve the learning questions that have
been the domain of NLP and address research topics in HCI such as managing human workers and
increasing the quality of their responses?
Language-based user interfaces NLP techniques have entered mainstream use, but the field currently
focuses more on building and improving systems and less on understanding how users interact with
them in real-world environments. User interface (UI) design decisions can affect the perceived or actual
performance of a system. For example, while machine translation (MT) quality improved considerably
over the last decade, studies found that human translators disliked MT output for reasons unrelated to
translation quality. Many existing systems present sentence-level translations in the absence of relevant
context, and disrupt rather than contribute to a translator’s workflow. How do we best integrate learning
methods, user behavior understanding, and human-centered design methodology?
Text Visualization and Analysis The quantity and diversity of linguistic corpora is swelling. Recent
work on visualizing text data annotated with linguistic structures (e.g., syntactic trees, hypergraphs, and
sequences) has produced tools that enable exploration of thematic and recurrence patterns in text. Visual
representations built on the outputs of word-level models (e.g., sentiment classifiers, topic models, and
continuous word embedding models) now power exploratory analysis of legal documents, political text,
and social media content. Beyond adding analytic value, interactive visualization can also reduce the
upfront effort needed to set up, configure, and learn a tool, as well as promote adoption. How do we
pair appropriate NLP techniques and visualizations to assist both expert and non-technical users, who
encounter a growing amount of linguistic data in their professional and everyday lives?

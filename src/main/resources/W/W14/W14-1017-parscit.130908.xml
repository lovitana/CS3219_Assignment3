<bodyText confidence="0.999617125">
Motivation of the language technology company Tilde is to improve quality of machine translation
for lesser resourced languages such as the languages of Baltic countries. Generic MT solutions like
Google Translate perform poorly for these complex languages. To compensate the shortage of
training data and to deal with rich morphology we are applying different approaches in combining
statistical methods with linguistic rules. We will present the strategies applied and the results of
various experiments. We will discuss application of the production systems that show significantly
better translation quality comparing to the Google Translate. We will also outline how this work
contributes to creation of the European infrastructure for automated translation.

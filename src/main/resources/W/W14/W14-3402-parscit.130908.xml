<bodyText confidence="0.999802892857143">
In this paper, we present a system for
recognizing temporal expressions related
to cell cycle phase (CCP) concepts in
biomedical literature. We identified 11
classes of cell cycle related temporal ex-
pressions, for which we made extensions
to TIMEX3, arranging them in an on-
tology derived from the Gene Ontology.
We annotated 310 abstracts from PubMed.
Annotation guidelines were developed,
consistent with existing time-related anno-
tation guidelines for TimeML. Two anno-
tators participated in the annotation. We
achieved an inter-annotator agreement of
0.79 for an exact span match and 0.82
for relaxed constraints. Our approach is
a hybrid of machine learning to recognize
temporal expressions and a rule-based ap-
proach to map them to the ontology. We
trained a named entity recognizer using
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) mod-
els. An off-the-shelf implementation of
the linear chain CRF model was used. We
obtained an F-score of 0.77 for temporal
expression recognition. We achieved 0.79
macro-averagee F-score and 0.78 micro-
averaged F-score for mapping to the on-
tology.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995560960784314">
Storing and processing temporal data in biomed-
ical informatics is important, but challeng-
ing (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007; Augusto, 2005).
Biomedical data is often intrinsically associated
with time. For example, data from electronic med-
ical records are on a clinical timeline (Zhou and
Hripcsak, 2007) which links all information on the
progress of a patient’s status. Temporal reasoning
remains a challenge for medical information sys-
tems (Combi and Shahar, 1997). Conventionally,
dictionaries define time as “The continuous pas-
sage of existence in which events pass from a state
of potentiality in the future, through the present, to
a state of finality in the past” (Editorial Staff, un-
dated). This traditional linear concept of tempo-
rality does not adequately capture the cyclical na-
ture of some important biological processes, such
as the cell cycle and circadian rhythms. In this pa-
per, we describe a system for the recognition of
temporal expressions related to cell cycle phases
in biomedical literature. The cell cycle is a phe-
nomenon that a cell goes through during its growth
and replication. Its stages are depicted in Figure 1.
We treat each phase as a distinct time component
and we aim at recognizing expressions that de-
scribe them in biomedical literature, then mapping
them to an ontology of cell cycle phases and tran-
sitions. Specifically, we are interested in recog-
nizing expressions that contain one or more of the
concepts shown in Table 1, where the Gene Ontol-
ogy is taken as definitional of concepts related to
phases of the cell cycle.
Recognition of cell cycle phase concepts from
text is a non-trivial problem. Some of the ways
that they can be mentioned in text, such as inter-
phase, anaphase, and prophase are relatively un-
ambiguous and can be recognized and mapped to
an ontology using regular expressions. However,
as is often the case both in general language and in
biomedical language, many of the ways in which
they can be mentioned are highly ambiguous. For
example, M, which stands for mitosis, is often a
unit of measurement, as in ... removal of histone
HI with 0,6 M NaCl. (PMID: 6183061) M could
also be an abbreviation of an author’s first name,
as in ... Suzuki S, Nakata M. (PMID: 23844291) S,
which refers to S-phase or synthesis phase, could
also stand for an author’s first name, as well as
a protein name, as in ... Protein S acts as a co-
factor for tissue factor pathway inhibitor. (PMID:
23841464). In addition, the word synthesis is in it-

We treated recognition of temporal expressions
from literature as a named entity recognition
(NER) problem. Many approaches to named en-
tity recognition are based on machine learning
techniques. Nadeau and Sekine report that al-
though semi-supervised learning algorithms have
been employed in NER challenges, most systems
that perform well are built based on supervised
learning techniques (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).
Based on this survey report, we used Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) for the recognition phase
of our approach. The details of our methods are
described in section 4.2.

a researcher’s interest in any domain is diffi-
cult. PubMed/MEDLINE allows search using
keywords, but until recently did not rank results by
document relevance. General-purpose search en-
gines such as Google and Bing rank their results,
but are not well-suited for search of specialized in-
formation related to genes and small molecules.
Building a specialized search engine exclusively
to search biomedical literature using genes and
small molecules as keywords could be very use-
ful, for instance, for cancer researchers.

Our long term goal is to build a spe-
cialized search engine specific to cancer re-
search. The system will retrieve articles from
PubMed/MEDLINE and rank them according to
their relevance. The system will utilize gene, pro-
tein, and small molecule names as keywords in
document search. We are also interested in identi-
fying the phase(s) of the cell cycle during which
the gene is expressed. After detecting the ac-
tive phase(s) of a gene or gene product, the sys-
tem will link relevant documents to this gene from
PubMed/MEDLINE. In this paper we present our
first step towards that goal, which is extraction of
temporal expressions from biomedical literature.
Temporal expressions will be used to identify ac-
tive phases of genes or gene products.

The results have contributed to the development
of diverse natural language processing applica-
tions, such as information extraction, information
retrieval, question-answering systems, text sum-
marization, etc. TimeML: Robust Specification of
Event and Temporal Expressions in Text (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003) is a specification language for
annotation of events and temporal expressions in
human language. TimeML addresses specification
issues like time stamping, order of events, reason-
ing about events, and time expressions.
TempEval is one of the shared challenges in-
cluded in SemEval (Agirre et al., 2009) as of 2007.
It aims at advancing research on processing tem-
poral information. Primarily it focuses on three
tasks: event extraction and classification, temporal
expression extraction and normalization, and tem-
poral relation extraction (UzZaman et al., 2013).
However, this ongoing work on temporal evalu-
ation is based on language data collected from
the news. In the clinical domain, (Styler IV et
al., Undated; Palmer and Pustejovsky, 2012; Al-
bright et al., 2013) describe the THYME annota-
tion project. The scope and language of temporal-
ity related to the cell cycle is different from that of
both TempEval and the clinical domain, and sup-
ports (and demands) different types of reasoning,
specifically related to cyclical time.
Cyclical phenomena are ubiquitous in can-
cer development and progression. The connec-
tion between the cell cycle and cancer is well
known (Vermeulen et al., 2003; Kastan and
Bartek, 2004; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009),
and the fact that the cell cycle is the main target
for cancer regulation, deregulation, and therapy
is well established (Vermeulen et al., 2003; Kas-
tan and Bartek, 2004; Malumbres and Barbacid,
2009). Circadian rhythms, rounds of chemother-
apy, remissions, and re-occurrences all have a
cyclic nature.Circadian rhythms have been inves-
tigated in the study of cancer treatment (Sahar and
Sassone-Corsi, 2009; Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2013;
Lengyel et al., 2009; Kelleher et al., 2014).
From the perspective of cancer research, identi-
fying cell cycle concepts in the literature is crucial
to being able to retrieve and explore information
related to cyclical biological processes like the cell
life cycle. From the natural language processing
perspective, the novelty of this work consists in
modeling cyclical time. To our knowledge, tempo-
ral event recognition grounded in a cyclical model
of time has not been previously proposed.

Two annotators with training in the domain per-
formed the annotation. Inter-annotator agreement
was calculated as F-measure, following (Hripcsak
and Rothschild, 2005). Inter-annotator agreement
was 0.79 for an exact-span match and 0.82 for re-
laxed matching. The constraints, which are values
of the attributes, were not considered while com-
puting IAA for the latter case.
The annotation effort developed through sev-
eral iterations, applying the annotation devel-
opment cycle introduced by Pustejovsky and
Stubbs (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012). This
methodology is depicted in Figure 4. It is called
the MATTER cycle, which stands for Model, An-

... the S phase of the cell cycle, as opposed
to the G0/G1 and early S phases in NHEJ and
late S to G2 phase in HR.
In this example, there are four temporal expres-
sions: S, G0/G1, early S, and late S to G2. The
expression “S” is of the type S-phase or synthesis
phase according to the conceptual ontology in
Table 1. The expression “G0/G1” can be classified
as G0 and G1. Similarly, the expression “late S to
G2” can be of type S and G2.
Our approach is a hybrid of machine learning
and rule-based techniques. The machine learning
technique, which we refer to as the first layer, is
applied for temporal expression recognition. In
this layer, CRFs are trained to learn to recognize
the expressions from the list of features which is
shown below.

• Does the word contain at least one of the
most common punctuation marks?
3. Digit-related features:
• Is the word a digit?
• Does the word contain a digit?

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are one of
the probabilistic graphical model sequence tag-

other probabilistic models like Hidden Markov
Models and Maximum Entropy Models for com-
plex systems is their support for features interact-
ing with one another. The linear chain CRF repre-
sentation is shown in Figure 5.

Our system achieved good performance on
both time expression recognition and mapping of
highly ambiguous concepts. In spite of the chal-
lenges presented by ambiguity, we obtained 0.85,
0.81, and 0.80 F-measures for recognizing and
mapping the concepts synthesis, M, and S, respec-
tively. The most informative features that con-
tribute to this score are the discriminating words
before and after a target token. These words are:
phase, arrest, and entry. They are often present
before or after CCP concepts. Also, presence of
modifiers is a good indication of CCP concepts.
For example, in the phase early S phase, the mod-
ifier early is one of the most informative features.
However, recognition of complex phrases as in
late S to G2 phase remained a challenge.
The challenges of complex temporal expres-
sions can be seen from a different perspective.

Mostly the system recognizes the individual con-
cepts within a complex phrase, but not the mod-
ifiers nor the words like prepositions within the
complex phrase. In the example given previously,
the system recognizes S and G2 but not the modi-
fier late, nor the preposition to. These challenges
could be tackled by having features that address
the modifiers as well as words within two con-
cepts.
We used a naive tokenizer that splits the text
into words based on white space. In the future,
we would like to test the system with other more
sophisticated tokenizers. We kept punctuation
marks in temporal expressions, for example, the
forward slash in G0/G1 phase. Presence of punc-
tuation marks, such as hyphen (-), forward slash
(/), comma (,) and single quote (’), within a token
is one of our features in training the machine learn-
ing algorithm to recognize temporal expressions.

8 Conclusions &amp; Future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998863041666667">
Cell cycle phase concepts are time expressions,
and can be annotated in a fashion similar to
TimeML. In this work, we annotated a corpus with
cell cycle phase information. This corpus can be
used to train machine learning algorithms to pre-
dict cell cycle phase concepts. The concepts were
annotated using the TIMEXCCP tag, an extension
of TIMEX3, which has the following attributes:
value, modifier, set, and comments. The details
are in Figure 3.
We have developed a temporal expression rec-
ognizer and classifier based on a hybrid of ma-
chine learning and rule-based techniques. We pro-
pose a two-tiered architecture to solve temporal
expression recognition and mapping for CCP con-
cepts. The first tier recognizes temporal expres-
sions using CRFs. In the second tier, a rule-based
system classifies the concepts.
Some of the main future directions for this
works are testing the system with the addition of
more annotated data. We will focus on how we
can capture complex time expressions. This might
take us to redefining the annotation guidelines that
we have right now.

<abstract confidence="0.992145310344828">In this paper, we present a system for recognizing temporal expressions related to cell cycle phase (CCP) concepts in biomedical literature. We identified 11 classes of cell cycle related temporal expressions, for which we made extensions to TIMEX3, arranging them in an ontology derived from the Gene Ontology. We annotated 310 abstracts from PubMed. Annotation guidelines were developed, consistent with existing time-related annotation guidelines for TimeML. Two annotators participated in the annotation. We achieved an inter-annotator agreement of 0.79 for an exact span match and 0.82 for relaxed constraints. Our approach is a hybrid of machine learning to recognize temporal expressions and a rule-based approach to map them to the ontology. We trained a named entity recognizer using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models. An off-the-shelf implementation of the linear chain CRF model was used. We obtained an F-score of 0.77 for temporal expression recognition. We achieved 0.79 macro-averagee F-score and 0.78 microaveraged F-score for mapping to the ontology.</abstract>

TempEval is one of the shared challenges included in SemEval (Agirre et al., 2009) as of 2007. It aims at advancing research on processing temporal information. Primarily it focuses on three tasks: event extraction and classification, temporal expression extraction and normalization, and temporal relation extraction (UzZaman et al., 2013). However, this ongoing work on temporal evaluation is based on language data collected from the news. In the clinical domain, (Styler IV et al., Undated; Palmer and Pustejovsky, 2012; Albright et al., 2013) describe the THYME annotation project. The scope and language of temporality related to the cell cycle is different from that of both TempEval and the clinical domain, and supports (and demands) different types of reasoning, specifically related to cyclical time. Cyclical phenomena are ubiquitous in cancer development and progression. The connection between the cell cycle and cancer is well known (Vermeulen et al., 2003; Kastan and Bartek, 2004; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009), and the fact that the cell cycle is the main target for cancer regulation, deregulation, and therapy is well establish</context>

Figure 3 shows the attributes and functions of the tag TIMEXCCP, as well as examples of usage. Figure 3: Attributes and functions of the TIMEXCCP tag. Two annotators with training in the domain performed the annotation. Inter-annotator agreement was calculated as F-measure, following (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005). Inter-annotator agreement was 0.79 for an exact-span match and 0.82 for relaxed matching. The constraints, which are values of the attributes, were not considered while computing IAA for the latter case. The annotation effort developed through several iterations, applying the annotation development cycle introduced by Pustejovsky and Stubbs (Pustejovsky and Stubbs, 2012).

Based on this survey report, we used Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for the recognition phase of our approach. The details of our methods are described in section 4.2.

Outer ring: I = Interphase, M = Mitosis; inner ring: M = Mitosis, G1 = Gap 1, G2 = Gap 2, S = Synthesis; not in ring: G0 = Gap 0/Resting [Wikipedia]. 2 Motivation A vast collection of biomedical literature in PubMed/MEDLINE and other biomedical journal repositories is estimated to grow exponentially (Hunter and Cohen, 2006), as shown in Figure 2. Searching for papers specific to a researcher’s interest in any domain is difficult. PubMed/MEDLINE allows search using keywords, but until recently did not rank results by document relevance. General-purpose search engines such as Google and Bing rank their results, but are not well-suited for search of specialized information related to genes and small molecules. Building a specialized search engine exclusively to search biomedical literature using genes and small molecules as keywords could be very useful, for instance, for cancer researchers.

Does the word contain either of the following: phase, arrest, entry? These words typically come before or after the cell cycle concepts. For example, early mitosis, G0 phase. 5. Part-of-Speech tagging: Window size of 2 before and after the word. 6. Presence of concept modifiers before the word. Modifiers include: early, mid, late, early-mid. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are one of the probabilistic graphical model sequence tagging techniques. They are understood as a sequential version of Maximum Entropy Models (Klinger and Tomanek, 2007). One advantage of CRFs over other probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Models and Maximum Entropy Models for complex systems is their support for features interacting with one another. The linear chain CRF representation is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: A linear chain Conditional Random Field representation (Klinger and Tomanek, 2007). In this representation, x is a vector of observations, also known as features in machine learning, and the yt’s are states or labels. In this linear chain model, a given state is dependent on its previous, current, and next states. It is also influenced by th</context>

(PMID: 9552372) We treated recognition of temporal expressions from literature as a named entity recognition (NER) problem. Many approaches to named entity recognition are based on machine learning techniques. Nadeau and Sekine report that although semi-supervised learning algorithms have been employed in NER challenges, most systems that perform well are built based on supervised learning techniques (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).

However, this ongoing work on temporal evaluation is based on language data collected from the news. In the clinical domain, (Styler IV et al., Undated; Palmer and Pustejovsky, 2012; Albright et al., 2013) describe the THYME annotation project. The scope and language of temporality related to the cell cycle is different from that of both TempEval and the clinical domain, and supports (and demands) different types of reasoning, specifically related to cyclical time. Cyclical phenomena are ubiquitous in cancer development and progression. The connection between the cell cycle and cancer is wel</context>

Our approach is a hybrid of machine learning to recognize temporal expressions and a rule-based approach to map them to the ontology. We trained a named entity recognizer using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) models. An off-the-shelf implementation of the linear chain CRF model was used. We obtained an F-score of 0.77 for temporal expression recognition. We achieved 0.79 macro-averagee F-score and 0.78 microaveraged F-score for mapping to the ontology. 1 Introduction Storing and processing temporal data in biomedical informatics is important, but challenging (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007; Augusto, 2005). Biomedical data is often intrinsically associated with time. For example, data from electronic medical records are on a clinical timeline (Zhou and Hripcsak, 2007) which links all information on the progress of a patient’s status. Temporal reasoning remains a challenge for medical information systems (Combi and Shahar, 1997). Conventionally, dictionaries define time as “The continuous passage of existence in which events pass from a state of potentiality in the future, through the present, to a state of finality in the past” (Editorial Staff, undated).

Welcome to the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Modeling Large Scale Social Interaction in Massively Open
Online Courses. An emerging area for real world impact of technology for analysis of social media at a
large scale is online education in Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The goal of this workshop
is to explore what the language technologies community has to offer this endeavor. At this one day
workshop organized around a shared task related to analysis of large scale social interaction in MOOCs,
we will grapple with the competing images of the inner workings of massive learning communities
provided by alternative computational approaches.
With the recent press given to online education and increasing enrollment in online courses, the need for
scaling up quality educational experiences online has never been so urgent. Current offerings provide
excellent materials including video lectures, exercises, and some forms of discussion opportunities. One
important hurdle that prevents MOOCs from reaching their transformative potential is that they fail to
provide the kind of social environment that is conducive to sustained engagement and learning, especially
as students arrive in waves to these online learning communities. While limited, current affordances for
social interaction in MOOCs have already shown some value for providing students with connection to
others that provides some needed motivational benefits.
Computational modeling of massive scale social interaction has the potential to yield new knowledge
about the inner-workings of interaction in such environments so that support for healthy community
formation can be designed and built. However, the state-of-the-art in graphical models applied to large
scale social data provides representations of the data that are challenging to interpret in light of specific
questions that may be asked from a learning sciences or social psychological perspective. What is
needed are new methodologies for development and interpretation of models that bridge expertise from
machine learning and language technologies on one side and learning sciences, sociolinguistics, and
social psychology on the other side. The field of language technologies has the human capital to take
leadership in making these breakthroughs. Other specific opportunities for the field associated with that
enterprise are problems in assessment of student work (e.g., automated essay scoring), generation of in
process feedback for students learning online independently or in groups (e.g. tutorial dialogue agents),
support for large scale threaded discussions (e.g., dialogue agent based facilitation), and summarization
of participation data for facilitators and course developers who revise and maintain course materials (e.g.,
conversation summarization).
MOOCs are especially interesting as a source of large scale social data. The unique developmental
history of MOOCs creates challenges that require insight into the inner-workings of massive scale social
interaction in order to meet. In particular, rather than evolving gradually as better understood forms of
online communities, MOOCs spring up overnight and then expand in waves as new cohorts of students
arrive from week to week to begin the course. As massive communities of strangers that lack shared
practices that would enable them to form supportive bonds of interaction, these communities grow in an
unruly manner. While some students may successfully find birds of a feather with whom to bond and find
support, when others come they may find an overwhelming amount of communication having already
been posted that they feel lost in. Others may find themselves somewhere in between these two extremes.
They may begin to form weak bonds with some other students when they join, however, massive attrition
may create challenges as members who have begun to form bonds with fellow students soon find their
virtual cohort dwindling. Early attempts to organize the community into smaller study groups may be
thwarted by such periodic growth spurts paired with attrition, as groups that initially had an appropriate
critical mass soon fall below that level and then are unable to support the needs of remaining students.
Can our models serve as useful lenses to offer insights into these social processes? Come to the workshop
and join in the discussion!!

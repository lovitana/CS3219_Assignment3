Statistically training a machine translation
model requires a parallel corpus contain-
ing a huge amount of aligned sentence
pairs in both languages. However, it is not
easy to obtain such a corpus when English
is not the source or the target language.
The European Parliament parallel corpus
contains only English sentence alignments
with 20 European languages, missing
alignments for other 190 language pairs. A
previous method using sentence length in-
formation is not enough reliable to pro-
duce alignments for training statistical
machine translation models. Hybrid meth-
ods combining sentence length and bilin-
gual dictionary information may produce
better results, but dictionaries may not be
affordable. Thus, we introduce a tech-
nique which aligns non-English corpora
from the European Parliament by using
English as a pivot language without a bi-
lingual dictionary. Our technique has been
illustrated with French and Spanish, re-
sulting on an equivalent performance with
the existing one in the original English-
French and English-Spanish corpora.

Obtaining a parallel corpus of aligned sentence
pairs is an important task to further work for hu-
man translators and several natural language pro-
cessing applications such as statistical machine
translation (Brown et al, 1990; Melamed, 1998),
cross-lingual information retrieval (Davis and
Dunning, 2995; Landauer and Littman, 1990;
Oard, 1997) and lexical acquisition (Gale and
Church, 1991; Melamed, 1997), to mention some.
Bilingual corpora are useful for human translators
to search for a chunk of text in a source language
and to find its corresponding translation into a tar-
get language. From the machine&apos;s standpoint, one
of the most common applications is on training
statistical models for machine translation. In the
translation domain, no matter human or machine,
they both need a very huge amount of aligned sen-
tence pairs in order to find appropriate word com-
bination that enable them to produce good trans-
lations.
Each language is a world of symbols made of
its own set of words and their possible combina-
tions that lead to a meaning from the native speak-
ers&apos; point of view. A parallel corpus comes as a
map in between two languages, indicating which
set of word combinations in a source language
produces another set of words in a target language.
Being so, we assume that the more sentence pairs
there are in a corpus, the better is the mapping be-
tween the two languages and consequently, the
better are the derived translations from it. There-
fore, a huge amount of translated sentence pairs is
essential.
Due to this growing demand, a number of par-
allel corpora have become available within the
last decade, for instance the Europarl corpus

Acquis corpus3, the MultiUN corpus4 and the EU
Official Journal EU Official Journal Multilingual
Legal Text in 22 European Languages (Gale and
Church, 1993), which are freely downloadable for
research purposes. The Europarl corpus in partic-
ular is a parallel corpus extracted from the pro-
ceedings of the European Parliament. It consists
of texts in 21 European languages, where English
is the only language with which the other lan-
guages are aligned. Some of the remaining re-
sources above mentioned do contain alignments
between all combinations of language pairs; how-
ever, the quality of these alignments is questiona-
ble given that the alignment method utilized for
most of them is solely based on sentence length
information (Varga et al., 2005). Our experiments
show that such alignments may present around
90% of precision. Obviously, the performance de-
pends on the internal arrangement of the sentences
being provided as input. Although the information
of a good bilingual dictionary may be used to en-
hance the performance of an aligner (Schmid,
19945), it is not normally available for free, even
less when none of the two languages involved is
English. In other words, most of the freely availa-
ble non-English parallel corpora have not been
aligned with the use of the respective bilingual
dictionaries and therefore the quality relies basi-
cally on sentence length information.
Although the Europarl corpus has also been
aligned with sentence length feature, there are un-
derlying alignment information and noise removal
which make the final quality to be very high. First,
its alignment is simplified by the fact that the texts
are originally available in a paragraph aligned for-
mat. Second, each paragraph is typically small,
containing from 2 to 5 sentences only. Third,
much noise is removed by discarding an utterance
of a speaker when the number of paragraphs in it
differs in the two languages being aligned. The
prior data preparation done by the underlying par-
agraph information combined with the noise re-

moval technique leads to an alignment of excel-
lent quality. According to our experiments its pre-
cision reaches more than 99%.
Each corpus contains approximately 2 million
English sentences and it is pairwise aligned with
20 other European languages. Since each parallel
corpus is independently aligned, the number of
sentences in each bitext is not the same across the
language pairs. Most of the difference is due to the
utterance removal process described above which
occurred prior to the alignment. Consequently, not
all the English sentences of a corpus (e.g. the Eng-
lish part from the English-French bitext) are pre-
sent in the other corpus (e.g. the English part from
the English-Spanish bitext). In other words, con-
sidering the English-French and the English-
Spanish corpora for example, not all of the Eng-
lish sentences from the former can be found in the
latter and viceversa. It means there are sentence
insertions, deletions and substitutions when we
consider two English corpora coming from
diferent aligned language pairs of the same Euro-
parl corpus.
It is unreasonable to expect the same alignment
precision of two non-English texts from the Euro-
parl corpus just by using the sentence length in-
formation. The prior sentence insertions, deletions
and substitutions introduce an observable noise
when comparing a pair of non-English texts, mak-
ing harder the work of the aligner. In fact, our ex-
periments point out to a precision of only 90%
given an amount of such a data. As previously
stated, a bilingual dictionary may be helpful to im-
prove this figure, but unfortunately, good ones are
very expensive6 to be affordable by developing
countries for research purposes.
Taking these constraints into consideration, we
have developed a sentence alignment method
which exempts the use a bilingual dictionary
when a multilingual corpus has previously and ef-
ficiently been aligned with English. This is the
case of the Europarl corpus which contains only
English sentence alignments with other lan-
guages. This paper is organized in the following

Bilingual Sentence Alignment Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995696598455599">
This section is divided into two parts. First, we de-
fine the core algorithm and explain which type of
corpus is needed in order to utilize the method.
Then we provide additional details of the algo-
rithm for implementation.
Assumptions and the Core of the Algorithm
We assume that we use a multilingual corpus
which has previously been aligned with at least
one language. Let&apos;s say that English is the pivot
language. We want to obtain sentence alignments
between any two foreign (non-English) languages
of this data. Let&apos;s illustrate our method with
French and Spanish. By assumption, there are
available an English-French and an English-Span-
ish corpora, where each corpus is individually
sentence aligned with English as the pivot lan-
guage. Although the majority of the English sen-
tences of both corpora are the same, not all of
them need to be so. In other words, we allow for
insertions, deletions and substitutions of English
sentences on both sides and therefore the number
of sentences in both bitexts are different. This is
the case of the Europarl corpus.
Our method is very simple. It basically consists
of creating a new alignment between two English
corpora while keeping the reference to the original
alignment information in order to map from one
foreign language to the other. For instance, sup-
pose that we need to obtain a French-Spanish sen-
tence alignment. Since English is the common
language for both English-French and English-
Spanish corpora, the English texts are first aligned
with each other. The original English-French and
the English-Spanish alignment information is the
basis for the new English-English sentence align-
ment to work properly.
Four cases are possible during this alignment
process. First, the simplest cases consist of those
sentences which are exactly the same in both cor-
pora (one-to-one cases). Second, the first side of
the corpus contains a short sentence which needs
to be concatenated with one or more adjacent sen-
tences in order to produce the same sequence of
characters as the second side (many-to-one cases).
Third, the first side of the corpus contains a long
sentence while the second contains a short sen-
tence which needs to be concatenated with one or
more adjacent sentences in order to result in the
same sequence of characters as the first side (one-
to-many cases). And finally, there are cases where
a sentence of a side is not a substring of the sen-
tence from the other side or vice-versa and there-
fore these sentence pairs are not easily aligned
(one-to-zero or zero-to-one cases).
In spite of this, we still try to find an alignment
for them, given that we allow for insertions, dele-
tions and substitutions of English sentences in the
input data at both sides. In such a case, our algo-
rithm temporarily stores the sentence positions of
both unaligned sentences in order to perform the
following procedures. A pointer to the sentence of
the first side refers to a string that is compared
with each one of the next 500 sentences of the sec-
ond side. If found somewhere, an alignment is ob-
tained and the algorithm proceeds from the next
sentence position on, at both sides. Otherwise, a
pointer to the sentence of the second side is used
for comparison with each of the next 500 sen-
tences of the first side. If found somewhere, an
alignment is obtained and the algorithm proceeds
from the next sentence position on, at both sides.
However, when no alignment can be obtained af-
ter trying these thousand times, we assume there
is no way of aligning those pointed sentences with
any other adjacent sentence of the opposite side.
Then it continues the execution of the aligner from
the next sentence positions on, right after the
pointers.
Note that we assume the number 500 as a gen-
erous search limit between the two texts, given
that during the preparation of the Europarl corpus,
each paragraph typically contained only a few
sentences and the discarded utterances occurred
only when the number of paragraphs in them dif-
fered in the original two languages being aligned.
During the execution of this algorithm, the his-
tory of all sentence positions having successful
English-English alignments is stored. We call it
ladder alignment history, making reference to the
Hunalign tool developed by Varga et al. It con-
tains a list of pair of numbers, representing the
sentence position of both English corpora having
successful alignment with each other. This is the
main information needed for aligning the pairs of
French and Spanish sentences of our example.
Note that the sentence positions on the left stand
for the English corpus originally aligned with
French, while the sentence positions on the right
stand for the English corpus originally aligned
with Spanish. Therefore, each pair of numbers
represents the alignment between French and
Spanish sentences. While the number of lines in
the ladder alignment history represent the number
of newly aligned sentences.
Also note that the sentence positions of the new
alignment are relative to the original alignments
in the English-French and English-Spanish paral-
lel corpora. It means that the original alignment
errors are also preserved. A new alignment error
is produced whenever an x English sentence is
correctly aligned with French but incorrectly
aligned with Spanish or vice-versa. This is a one-
to-one error type, and it is due to a single bad pre-
existing alignment which is found either in the
English-French or in the English-Spanish corpus.
Now, let&apos;s consider the case where a y English
sentence is originally misaligned with both
French and Spanish at the same time. The newly
produced alignment accounts for both as a single
error, given that the French sentence is misaligned
with a single Spanish sentence. This is a two-to-
one error type.
#New alignment errors ≤ ∑(#alignment errors of
Pivot-Foreign1) +∑(#alignment errors of Pivot-
Foreign2) (Equation 1)
It implies that the number of alignment errors
produced by our algorithm is usually less than the
sum of all misalignments for each original bitext.
In the worst case, there is no two-to-one error
type, i.e. the sentences of both parallel corpora do
not contain any overlapping misalignments. In
such a case, the number of new alignment errors
is the sum of all misalignments present in both
original corpora. This idea is expressed by Equa-
tion (1), where Pivot indicates the common lan-
guage of the original alignments (i.e. English),
while Foreign1 and Foreign2 represent the pair of
foreign languages that our algorithm aligns, being
illustrated here by the French and Spanish lan-
guages.
Additional Details of the Algorithm
1. Now that we have presented the core of our
algorithm, we introduce some further details
which allow our algorithm to work efficiently.
When an English-English alignment is one-to-
many or many-to-one, a special symbol is added
in between two adjacent sentences. The amount of
special symbols indicates how many short adja-
cent sentences are concatenated together in order
to correspond to the same string of characters as
the long sentence. We also store the information
whether the concatenated short sentences are on
the left (English-French corpus) or on the right
(English-Spanish corpus), so that our algorithm
can later reproduce the same number of sentence
concatenations to the adjacent sentences of a cor-
pus. This information is stored in the ladder align-
ment history as a pair of numbers, where the first
one stands for the number of concatenated English
sentences originating from the English-French
corpus while the second is the number of concat-
enated English sentences originating from the
English-Spanish corpus.
However, the ladder alignment history at this
point is not yet ready. Some wrong alignment
might have been introduced during the English-
English sentence alignment process, which is nor-
mal for any aligner. We do here a post-processing
which confirms whether every pair of aligned
English sentences contains exactly the same string
of characters. The wrongly aligned sentences are
removed. This is the way we use for automatically
validating the produced alignments. We do so by
fetching the respective pair of English sentences
whose indexes are present in the ladder alignment
history. They are extracted from both English
texts, respectively from the English-French and
the English-Spanish corpora. Then, we remove
the special symbols used for sentence concatena-
tion of one-to-many or many-to-one cases in order
to perform the string comparisons. Finally, we
preserve only those lines containing exactly the
same English sentences, and consequently pro-
ducing a clean ladder alignment history.
We use the sentence alignment information pre-
sent in it to obtain the aligned foreign sentence
pairs. It tells the sentence index of the first foreign
language which matches with the sentence index
of the second one. It also tells on a sentence basis
how many adjacent sentences of a corpus need to
be concatenated in order to fully correspond to its
translation. The work of the algorithm from this
point on is basically to read the pieces of data from
the following three files: ladder alignment history,
first and second foreign language corpora. It com-
bines the sentences together in order to produce
the aligned parallel corpus. It finalizes the process
by removing null sentence pairs and those having
null translations.
Experiments
2. We want to quantify the efficiency of our al-
gorithm to produce an aligned parallel corpus of
non-English language pairs given that the sen-
tences in both languages have been previously
aligned with English. We illustrate the perfor-
mance of our method by using the French and the
Spanish texts from the Europarl corpus, which had
been previously aligned with English on an indi-
vidual basis. The English-French and the English-
Spanish parallel corpora are freely available for
download.
We have created a reference French-Spanish
parallel corpus from the Europarl data. We ex-
tracted the first 14,941 sentences from the French
corpus and the first 14,356 sentences from the
Spanish corpus, totalizing 29,297 monolingual
sentences. This alignment has been done in three
steps. First, each corpus has been individually
lemmatized by using the TreeTagger software.
Second, we utilized a sentence aligner software
called Hunalign to produce the sentence align-
ments, providing both lemmatized corpora as in-
put and a French-Spanish bilingual dictionary of
69,231 entries. Finally, we manually revised all
the automatically produced alignments by the
tool. Although a considerable part of the align-
ments were correct, we still had to apply manual
corrections on about 2,000 alignments. As result,
we obtained 13,847 pairs of correctly aligned
French-Spanish sentences. This is the gold data
for the evaluation.
Once we have the reference alignments ready,
we align the sentences based on two previous
methods. For that, we utilize the Hunalign soft-
ware. This tool can perform the work based only
on sentence length information (6). In this case,
the input data is the pair of texts to be aligned.
This first method produces our baseline align-
ments. In addition, the software can also align sen-
tences based on the combination of sentence
length and bilingual dictionary information. In
this case, the input data is the same pair of texts
and a good bilingual dictionary. This second
method is supposed to produce better results than
the baseline.
Finally, we are ready to evaluate our algorithm.
It receives as input the 14,941 non-lemmatized
English sentences coming from the English-
French corpus and the 14,356 non-lemmatized
English sentences coming from the English-Span-
ish corpus. Initially, it produces 14,855 non-vali-
dated English-English sentence alignments. We
call it non-validated because at this point our al-
gorithm still needs to confirm whether every pair
of aligned English sentences matches exactly the
same string of characters for both corpora. After
the validation process has taken place, it produces
a total amount of 13,711 English-English sentence
alignments in the clean ladder alignment history.

4 Results and Discussions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861941860465">
First, we want to check the performance of the
alignment based only on sentence length infor-
mation, which is our baseline. For this, we provide
the Hunalign tool with 14,941 lemmatized sen-
tences from the French corpus and the 14,356
lemmatized sentences from the Spanish corpus.
Consequently, it produces 13,459 true positives
out of 13,847 and 1,354 false positives. This out-
come indicates a precision rate of 0.908. The num-
ber of false negatives is 388 (13,847-13,459), re-
sulting on a recall rate of 0.972. Table 1 shows
these results under the column Baseline.
Second, we want to check the performance of the
alignment based on sentence length combined
with bilingual dictionary information. Now, the
tool receives as input the same lemmatized paral-
lel corpus and our French-Spanish bilingual dic-
tionary having 69,231 entries. It produces 13,704
true positives out of 13,847, while the number of
false positives is 1,146. As for the precision rate,
it raises to 0.923. The number of false negatives
decreases to 143 (13,847-13,704) cases, produc-
ing a recall rate of 0.989. The results of this ex-
periment are summarized on the SL+Dic column
of Table 1.
Third, after obtaining the 13,711 sentence pairs
described in the last paragraph of Section 3, our
algorithm removes the null sentence pairs and
those having null translations. Finally we obtain a
French-Spanish parallel corpus having 13,640 en-
tries. Then we compare our alignments with the
reference. On the one hand, we obtain a result of
13,542 correct alignments and 98 incorrect ones.
In other words, the number of true positives is
13,542 instances while the number of false posi-
tives is just 98 cases. This result indicates a very
good precision rate of 0.993. On the other hand,
the algorithm misses 305 (13,847-13,542) align-
ments that are still possible. This figure represents
the instances of false negatives, which leads to a
recall rate of 0.978. Table 1 contains these results
under its last column.
For this particular data, the misses of correct
alignments is more than 3 times the number of
false positives, representing a loss rate of 2.2% of
all possible correct alignments. This implies that
if the size of a parallel corpus for training a statis-
tical machine translator model is very large, the
loss would be irrelevant since the amount of train-
ing data would still be very large. For such a pur-
pose and under such conditions, an excellent pre-
cision rate is much more relevant than a perfect
recall. Note that the highest possible precision rate
is essential because otherwise wrong sentence
alignments necessarily produce wrong word mis-
alignments and consequently wrong translations.
However when the number of wrong sentence
alignments present in the parallel corpora is mini-
mal (i.e. less than 1%), lesser will be the errors
introduced to the posterior training of word align-
ments. In fact, good translation models depend not
only on the size of a parallel corpus, but also on
the high quality of the sentence alignments. In Ta-
ble 1, we present the results of the evaluation by
using three methods: 1) sentence length (SL) in-
formation (baseline), 2) sentence length + bilin-
gual dictionary (SL+Dic) information and 3) our
method, which is based on the high quality of ex-
isting alignments with the pivot language. Note
also that the method proposed by Gale and
Church, 1991 is indicated as a baseline when there
is no other source of information available than
the sentences themselves. However, when a good
bilingual dictionary is available, an improvement
is observed and the precision rate rises in 15% _
(100-(1,146*100/1,354))/100 for the tested data.
But an even better result is obtained when a high
quality alignment has been previously performed
with a pivot language. The improvement we could
observe from applying our method was 92% _
(100-(98*100/1,354))/100 for the tested data. This
excellent result suggests that our method is effi-
cient to transfer the original alignment infor-
mation from a pair of parallel corpora sharing a
common language to aligning the new pair of lan-
guages in question.

3. A number of natural language processing ap-
plications heavily depend upon the availability of
a parallel corpus. Statistical machine translation
for instance requires a parallel corpus containing
a huge amount of aligned sentence pairs in both
languages. However, the lack of availability of al-
most perfectly aligned non-English parallel cor-
pus makes unfeasible the development of such ap-
plications and researches.
Nevertheless, the relatively recent availability
of the Europarl corpus which aligns English sen-
tences with other 20 European languages has shed
light on the development of our new method for
obtaining such a training data. We have intro-
duced a technique, which allows for sentence
alignments of non-English texts based on the orig-
inal English alignments, given a multilingual par-
allel corpus such as the Europarl.
Our method has been evaluated and tested
against two previous methods: the first one utiliz-
ing sentence length information (baseline), while
the second one, combining sentence length with
bilingual dictionary information. Our method has
proved to be much more efficient to align French
and Spanish sentences than the other two previous
methods. By applying our method, we could ob-
serve an error rate reduction of false positives of
92% in comparison with the baseline. Of course,
this is due to the good quality of the original align-
ments, which are present in the Europarl corpus.
Unfortunately, the proposed approach of aligning
corpora at the sentence level cannot be applied to
all sorts of bilingual data as it needs the source and
target already aligned with a pivot language. This
is a limitation of course, but even more limiting is
when there is no reliable parallel corpus available
at all for the desired language pairs.
Further work on this area stands for applying
our method over all the 20 European languages of
the Europarl texts. The use of our method will al-
low for building up to 190 new language pairs out
of these corpora. We intend to develop mecha-
nisms to process all this data and make the non-
English parallel corpora available for future re-
search and development of natural language pro-
cessing applications. We hope this contribution
will foster research and innovation in order to help
on the development of machine translation sys-
tems for language pairs which data is not afforda-
ble or cannot be easily obtained.

<abstract confidence="0.980349481481482">Statistically training a machine translation model requires a parallel corpus containing a huge amount of aligned sentence pairs in both languages. However, it is not easy to obtain such a corpus when English is not the source or the target language. The European Parliament parallel corpus contains only English sentence alignments European languages, missing alignments for other 190 language pairs. A previous method using sentence length information is not enough reliable to produce alignments for training statistical machine translation models. Hybrid methods combining sentence length and bilingual dictionary information may produce better results, but dictionaries may not be affordable. Thus, we introduce a technique which aligns non-English corpora from the European Parliament by using English as a pivot language without a bilingual dictionary. Our technique has been illustrated with French and Spanish, resulting on an equivalent performance with the existing one in the original English- French and English-Spanish corpora.</abstract>

Our technique has been illustrated with French and Spanish, resulting on an equivalent performance with the existing one in the original EnglishFrench and English-Spanish corpora. 1 Introduction Obtaining a parallel corpus of aligned sentence pairs is an important task to further work for human translators and several natural language processing applications such as statistical machine translation (Brown et al, 1990; Melamed, 1998), cross-lingual information retrieval (Davis and Dunning, 2995; Landauer and Littman, 1990; Oard, 1997) and lexical acquisition (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed, 1997), to mention some. Bilingual corpora are useful for human translators to search for a chunk of text in a source language and to find its corresponding translation into a target language. From the machine&apos;s standpoint, one of the most common applications is on training statistical models for machine translation. In the translation domain, no matter human or machine, they both need a very huge amount of aligned sentence pairs in order to find appropriate word combination that enable them to produce good translations.

In fact, good translation models depend not only on the size of a parallel corpus, but also on the high quality of the sentence alignments. In Table 1, we present the results of the evaluation by using three methods: 1) sentence length (SL) information (baseline), 2) sentence length + bilingual dictionary (SL+Dic) information and 3) our method, which is based on the high quality of existing alignments with the pivot language. Note also that the method proposed by Gale and Church, 1991 is indicated as a baseline when there is no other source of information available than the sentences themselves. However, when a good bilingual dictionary is available, an improvement is observed and the precision rate rises in 15% _ (100-(1,146*100/1,354))/100 for the tested data. But an even better result is obtained when a high quality alignment has been previously performed with a pivot language. The improvement we could observe from applying our method was 92% _ (100-(98*100/1,354))/100 for the tested data. This excellent result suggests that our method is efficient to transfer the origi</context>

Although the information of a good bilingual dictionary may be used to enhance the performance of an aligner (Schmid, 19945), it is not normally available for free, even less when none of the two languages involved is English. In other words, most of the freely available non-English parallel corpora have not been aligned with the use of the respective bilingual dictionaries and therefore the quality relies basically on sentence length information. Although the Europarl corpus has also been aligned with sentence length feature, there are underlying alignment information and noise removal which make the final quality to be very high.

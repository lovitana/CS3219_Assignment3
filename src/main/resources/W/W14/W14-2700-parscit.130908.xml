These proceedings contain papers presented at the Joint Workshop on Social Dynamics and Personal
Attributes in Social Media. The workshop was held in Baltimore, Maryland, USA and hosted in
conjunction with the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics.
This workshop was intended to serve as a forum for sharing research in:
I NLP and Social Dynamics: Language is a set of publicly agreed conventions that serves the
purpose of inter-personal communication. Speakers (or writers) try to convey a message, instill
an idea or make an impression on the listeners. Listeners (or readers), in turn, are affected by the
message and may respond to it. Language, in that sense, is an important vehicle that shapes (and
is shaped by) social dynamics.
Traditional NLP research, however, focuses on &amp;quot;documents&amp;quot; (either of full length or on the
sentence level), rather than on the communication process as reflected by language use. Common
examples of traditional NLP research are parsing, document classification, machine translation,
and sentiment analysis at the sentence and document level without considering the social dynamics
of the people who are writing and reading those texts. We propose to move beyond analyzing
the informational aspect of documents and discuss ways in which NLP can contribute to gaining
insights about the interplay between language use and various levels of social dynamics.
II Personal Attributes in Social Media: There are many important social science questions and
commercial applications that are impacted by the large amounts of diverse personalized data
emerging from social media. These data can reveal user interests, preferences and opinions, as
well as trends and activity patterns for companies and their products.
The automatic prediction of latent attributes from discourse in social media includes topics such as:
inferring user/customer demographic profiles (gender, age, religion, social status, race, ethnicity,
origin); predicting user interests (sports, movies) and preferences (political favorites or product
likes); classifying sentiment, personality, emotional states (onset of depression), and opinions held
by an author; and analyzing general trends and influence for companies and products.
We invited original and unpublished research papers on all topics related to NLP and social dynamics
and text-driven attribute prediction in social media, including but not limited to the topics listed below.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99123915">
NLP and Social Dynamics:
• Emergence and diffusion of slang, neologisms and metaphors
• Emotion dynamics in social media conversation threads
• Evolution of word formation and word meaning
• Language coordination and lexical entrainment
• Language evolution through history and language variation across communities
• Linguistic and social factors in acceptance of new words and phrases
• Persuasive language and (online) campaigns
• Pragmatics of language
iii
• Social dynamics in (blog/news story) comment threads
Personal Attributes in Social Media:
• Dynamic and streaming nature of social media data
• Data collection, sharing and labeling biases for personal analytics in social media
• Joint latent attribute prediction (e.g., age together with political preference)
• Emotional states, distress, mental condition classification in social networks
• Mood, sentiment, emotion and opinion analysis of authors in social media
• Multi-relational aspect of social media (e.g., networks of friends, followers, user mentions etc.)
• Scalability to other understudied languages and dialects in social media
• Security, identity and privacy issues for personal analytics in social media.

The Workshop Committee received 24 submissions. Three reviewers reviewed each submission. For the
final workshop program, 15 regular papers, 5 to 11 pages each, were selected, 3 papers were rejected
and 3 withdrawn. 3 papers have chosen to be non-archived. Authors affiliations include Computer and
Information Science, Linguistics, Political Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion, History, English
and Business and Management.
We would like to thank all Program Committee members and external reviewers for their effort in
providing high-quality reviews. We thank all the authors who submitted their papers. Many thanks
to our invited speakers and panel participants.

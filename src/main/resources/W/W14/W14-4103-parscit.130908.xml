Identifying and understanding the motiva-
tions of student leaders from Massively
Open Online Course (MOOC) discussion
forums provides the key to making the on-
line learning environment engaging, col-
laborative, and instructive. In this pa-
per, we propose to identify student lead-
ers solely based on textual features, or
specifically by analyzing how they influ-
ence other students’ language. We propose
an improved method of measuring lan-
guage accommodation based on people’s
choice of words given a semantic topic of
interest, and show that student leaders in-
deed coordinate other students’ language
usage. We also show that our proposed
method can successfully distinguish stu-
dent leaders from the two MOOC discus-
sion forum datasets.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999985066666667">
One of the challenges Massively Open Online
Courses (MOOCs) face is that they lack a phys-
ical medium that enables active real-time interac-
tion between students and instructors, especially
when compared to the offline learning environ-
ment. While online discussion forums in MOOCs
play an important role in bridging this gap, the
“massiveness” of the student size makes it hard
for instructors to provide sufficient feedback or an-
swers to students’ questions in a timely manner.
It is often the student leaders who accommo-
date this situation by voluntarily helping other stu-
dents and answering their questions in discussion
forums. The student leaders encourage other stu-
dents to participate in the discussion and make the
online learning experience much more collabora-
tive and engaging. Therefore, it is important to
identify student leaders and understand their mo-
tivations, thus promoting more students to act like
leaders. Identifying leadership in MOOCs also
brings new insights to the multi-dimensional eval-
uation of students in online courses. This signif-
icantly builds upon previous literature that evalu-
ates students taking MOOCs solely based on their
task-oriented performance (Foltz and Rosenstein,
2013; Basu et al., 2013).
Identifying student leaders in MOOC courses
is a challenging task, as illustrated in Figure 1.
While most of the student leaders actively inter-
act with other students in a large cluster of people,
some student leaders only lead a small clique of
students. Activeness of student participation can-
not be a sole measure to identify student leaders,
because there are a number of active ‘questioners’
who exhibit very different motivations from stu-
dent leaders. This challenge inspires us to look
closely at the language of the leaders in order to
identify them.
The task of identifying leaders has been well
studied in various domains, but the challenge is of-
ten unique to the specific property of an online net-
work or a community. For example, a frequency-
based data mining approach has been proven par-
ticularly successful for a social network with a
strong visibility control (e.g. a friend network) and
a discrete set of user actions (e.g. sharing of a post,
etc.) (Goyal et al., 2008; Bodendorf and Kaiser,
2009; Shafiq et al., 2013). In their work, they
identify leaders by tracking how a certain action
gets shared and propagated among a given net-
work of users. However, it is challenging to apply
this approach for identifying leaders from MOOC
discussion forums, because a visibility network of
users or community actions are not clearly defined
in MOOCs.
For an online community forum where the
query information and use pattern are accessible,
several studies have proposed to use the link struc-
ture and the topic information about users to iden-
tify opinion leaders (Li et al., 2013; Pal and Kon-

edge represents a student and an interaction of two
students within the forum (e.g. enough number
of conversation exchanges above a threshold), re-
spectively. Larger white nodes refer to the an-
notated student leaders. While most of the lead-
ers are highly connected (actively interacting with
other students), note that the white nodes may also
appear in small cliques as well. Some of the highly
connected nodes are not labeled as leaders, whom
we refer to as active ‘questioners’.
stan, 2010; Sharara et al., 2011). They employ
features such as PageRank, HITS, and other non-
linguistic features such as longevity (how long the
person has stayed on the forum), etc., all of which
serve as a cue in determining and identifying the
extent of users’ expertise and influence.
While some of the MOOC datasets provide this
information, in this paper we only focus on the
textual features of the MOOC discussion forums
so that we can target general MOOC datasets. We
show that we can identify leaders as role models
who influence through language, and show how
a community norm may form within a short life
span of an online course via student leaders. We
also propose a new approach to measure language
accommodation which in our experiment furthers
the previous literature on the subject.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 explains in detail the approach that we
propose to identify leaders. Section 3 gives a brief
overview of the two MOOC datasets from differ-
ent courses, and we present our empirical evalu-
ation in Section 4 on these datasets. Finally, we
give our concluding remarks and proposed future
work in Section 5.

2 Methods
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980688888889">
It is well studied by the linguistics community
that people tend to mimic the style of speech or
choices of words made by the people that they
are communicating with (Niederhoffer and Pen-
nebaker, 2002). This phenomena is called lan-
guage coordination, which is frequently observed
especially when there are power differences within
the conversation participants (Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil and Lee, 2011; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et
al., 2012). We hypothesize that the power differ-
ence may arise within the students as well, espe-
cially through dependence: if a student A needs
knowledge from a student B, and is thus depen-
dent on B, this gives B a temporary power over
A. As such, we identify a set of student leaders by
how much other students accommodate their lan-
guage when they converse with student leaders.
In order to measure students’ language coordi-
nation towards student leaders, we take the similar
approach proposed by (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil
et al., 2012). In their work, they provide a concise
probabilistic coordination measure which defines
language coordination from a speaker to a target
on a set of function words. Specifically, they use 8
pre-defined categories and a total of 451 lexemes
as a set of function words to track the language
influence. Their proposed accommodation mea-
sure is shown to be successful in distinguishing the
individuals of different power status. While this
work bases its motivation from a specific line of
work in the linguistics that defines particular func-
tion words as markers for influence, it does not
fully capture the broad range of linguistic behav-
iors that are reported as language accommodation
(Baxter and Braithwaite, 2008; Hall, 2008).
In this paper, we propose to measure language
coordination based on people’s choice of words,
given a specific theme. Consider word clusters
learned from a large corpus, where words are
grouped by their semantic similarity. During a
conversation between a speaker A and a target B,
they can draw words from any cluster, which is
analogous to choosing a topic or theme to dis-
cuss. Given a theme, people may choose any
words from the chosen cluster, all of which have
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.998940083333333">
a semantically similar meaning. However, if A
follows B’s specific choice of words given a clus-
ter, we consider this action as evidence for lan-
guage accommodation of A towards B. Based on
the probabilistic analysis, we measure the overall
language coordination for each conversation par-
ticipant. Note that this definition of language ac-
commodation can capture language coordination
beyond the use of particular function words, and
provide a way to analyze broader language influ-
ence that is unique to the community. Figure 2
shows the illustration of this approach.

choice of word from a cluster, given all the other
options of similar words within the same cluster,
we define this action as language accommodation
of A towards B.
To cluster words based on their syntactic and
semantic similarity, we take the approach by
(Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b)
which maps words into high-dimensional vectors
based on their statistical occurrence in relation to
other words in a sentence. We then use the K-
means clustering algorithm (MacQueen, 1967) to
group the words by their Euclidean distance within
the semantic space. To reduce the computational
complexity, we pick the 20 most frequent clusters
from the dataset that we analyze, and we use the
words in those clusters as markers to track lan-
guage coordination.
We then borrow the definition of language ac-
commodation measure by (Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil et al., 2012), and define the language coordi-
nation of a speaker a towards a target b on a marker
wk (that belongs to a word cluster k) as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9732345">
Cwk(a → b) = P(E&apos;/ k →ub |E ,k) − P(Ewk
ua→ub)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.991284357142857">
where a is the speaker that coordinates towards the
target b, Ewk
ua→ub is the event that the utterance of
a exhibits a linguistic marker wk in its reply to the
utterance of b, and Ewk
ub is the event that the utter-
ance of b exhibits a marker wk. The conversation
set is defined over the exchanges that contain the
words from a given cluster k.
In a thread-based discussion forum like the
MOOC datasets, however, it is ambiguous to tell
who is talking with whom. Therefore, we define
the conversational exchange between b and a if b’s
post appears after a’s post in the same thread.

3 MOOC Dataset
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999786473684211">
In this section, we describe the two MOOC online
discussion forum datasets we used in our studies.
The datasets consist of the conversations from two
courses from Coursera1: Learn to Program: The
Fundamentals (Python) and Introduction to Psy-
chology as a Science (Psychology). The Python
course consists of 3,509 students, 7 instructors and
24,963 posts across 10 weeks. Each thread con-
sists of replies and comments along with a user-
name associated with it. The Psychology course
spans over 12 weeks and has 1,982 students and
3 instructors. In our studies, we focus on the
interaction between three groups of people: in-
structors (including professors and teaching assis-
tants), student leaders, and non-leaders. In order to
evaluate the performance of the proposed method
on the MOOC discussion forums, we have hand-
annotated leaders and non-leaders from a subset of
the student pool.

4 Results and Discussion

We test the following two hypotheses on lan-
guage accommodation: (1) students coordinate
more towards student leaders than towards non-
student leaders (Htarget), and (2) student leaders
coordinate towards other students less than non-
student leaders coordinate towards other students
(Hspeaker). Figure 3 shows the language accom-
modation of three different groups (instructors,
leaders, and non-leaders) with other students that
are not labeled as any group. We provide the
results for the case when we apply our cluster-
based accommodation measure to test Htarget and
Hspeaker, and for when we use the function words
as markers to track accommodation (Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012). For the cluster-

based method, we use word2vec2 which pro-
vides the word vectors trained on the Google News
corpus (about 100 billion words) (Mikolov et al.,
2013b). Table 1 directly shows the difference be-
tween the two methods.
Figure 3 shows that student leaders influence
other students’ language more than non-leaders
do (p &lt; 0.05), supporting our first hypothesis
Htarget. It can also be seen that the language
of non-leaders coordinates towards that of other
students more than the language of student lead-
ers does (p &lt; 0.05), supporting our second hy-
pothesis Hspeaker. Note that instructors and lead-
ers exhibit almost the same behavior in terms of
language accommodation. These results coincide
with the observation that student leaders and in-
structors play a similar role in discussion forums.
In addition, while both word cluster-based and
LIWC-derived methods support our hypotheses,
the distinction seen is more significant in the result
from our cluster-based method (summarized in Ta-
ble 1). These results indicate that the proposed
method of measuring accommodation can capture
the language influence more accurately than the
previous method.
Based on our proposed measure of language ac-

commodation, we were able to see how language
influence is accumulated throughout the lifetime
of the community. Figure 4 shows that the lan-
guage coordination of students towards student
leaders decreases as the course progresses, even-
tually converging to the level of language coordi-
nation from students to non-student leaders. The
same convergence behavior can be observed from
the language coordination of student leaders and
non-leaders towards students as well. This re-
sult indicates that the distinction between students
and non-student leaders becomes less significant
in terms of their language influence. This result
can also be interpreted as a community norm being
formed throughout the course, which was initiated
by student leaders at first. While MOOC courses
have a relatively short lifespan, the results make
intuitive sense because they often include techni-
cal jargon (e.g. the programming related words
for Python MOOC course) which can be quickly
learned by community members.

word cluster-based method. LIWC uses the binary
features as well, using the LIWC-derived function
words as markers for accommodation. BOW refers
to a standard bag of words feature set.
We test the performance on both in-domain and
cross-domain cases using the datasets from the
two different courses. While BOW performs sig-
nificantly better than the other two coordination
features-based methods for the in-domain cases,
it does not generalize well for the cross-domain
cases. This is because there are unique sets of
technical vocabulary that are used in each respec-
tive course, which are often strong indicators of
leadership or expertise in the domain. The pro-
posed cluster-based method performs better than
LIWC in both in-domain and cross-domain cases,
showing that the proposed method better captures
the leader’s language influence on other students.

The student leaders encourage other students to participate in the discussion and make the online learning experience much more collaborative and engaging. Therefore, it is important to identify student leaders and understand their motivations, thus promoting more students to act like leaders. Identifying leadership in MOOCs also brings new insights to the multi-dimensional evaluation of students in online courses. This significantly builds upon previous literature that evaluates students taking MOOCs solely based on their task-oriented performance (Foltz and Rosenstein, 2013; Basu et al., 2013). Identifying student leaders in MOOC courses is a challenging task, as illustrated in Figure 1. While most of the student leaders actively interact with other students in a large cluster of people, some student leaders only lead a small clique of students.

While this work bases its motivation from a specific line of work in the linguistics that defines particular function words as markers for influence, it does not fully capture the broad range of linguistic behaviors that are reported as language accommodation (Baxter and Braithwaite, 2008; Hall, 2008). In this paper, we propose to measure language coordination based on people’s choice of words, given a specific theme. Consider word clusters learned from a large corpus, where words are grouped by their semantic similarity. During a conversation between a speaker A and a target B, they can draw words from any cluster, which is analogous to choosing a topic or theme to discuss. Given a theme, people may choose any words from the chosen cluster, all of which have 16 a semantically similar meaning.

Finally, we give our concluding remarks and proposed future work in Section 5. 2 Methods It is well studied by the linguistics community that people tend to mimic the style of speech or choices of words made by the people that they are communicating with (Niederhoffer and Pennebaker, 2002). This phenomena is called language coordination, which is frequently observed especially when there are power differences within the conversation participants (Danescu-NiculescuMizil and Lee, 2011; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012). We hypothesize that the power difference may arise within the students as well, especially through dependence: if a student A needs knowledge from a student B, and is thus dependent on B, this gives B a temporary power over A. As such, we identify a set of student leaders by how much other students accommodate their language when they converse with student leaders. In order to measure students’ language coordination towards student leaders, we take the similar approach proposed by (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012). In their work, they provide a concise probabilistic coordination measure</context>

The student leaders encourage other students to participate in the discussion and make the online learning experience much more collaborative and engaging. Therefore, it is important to identify student leaders and understand their motivations, thus promoting more students to act like leaders. Identifying leadership in MOOCs also brings new insights to the multi-dimensional evaluation of students in online courses. This significantly builds upon previous literature that evaluates students taking MOOCs solely based on their task-oriented performance (Foltz and Rosenstein, 2013; Basu et al., 2013). Identifying student leaders in MOOC courses is a challenging task, as illustrated in Figure 1. While most of the student leaders actively interact with other students in a large cluster of people, some student leaders only lead a small clique of students. Activeness of student participation cannot be a sole measure to identify student leaders, because there are a number of active ‘questioners’ who exhibit very different motivations from student leaders. This challenge inspires us to look closely at the language of the leaders in order to identify them. The task of identif</context>

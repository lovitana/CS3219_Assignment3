This paper examines approaches to gener-
ate lexical resources for endangered lan-
guages. Our algorithms construct bilin-
gual dictionaries and multilingual the-
sauruses using public Wordnets and a ma-
chine translator (MT). Since our work re-
lies on only one bilingual dictionary be-
tween an endangered language and an “in-
termediate helper” language, it is applica-
ble to languages that lack many existing
resources.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99987732">
Languages around the world are becoming extinct
at a record rate. The Ethnologue organization1 re-
ports 424 languages as nearly extinct and 203 lan-
guages as dormant, out a total of 7,106 recorded
languages. Many other languages are becoming
endangered, a state which is likely to lead to their
extinction, without determined intervention. Ac-
cording to UNESCO, “a language is endangered
when its speakers cease to use it, use it in fewer
and fewer domains, use fewer of its registers and
speaking styles, and/or stop passing it on to the
next generation...”. In America, UNESCO reports
134 endangered languages, e.g., Arapaho, Chero-
kee, Cheyenne, Potawatomi and Ute.
One of the hallmarks of a living and thriving
language is the existence and continued produc-
tion of “printed” (now extended to online pres-
ence) resources such as books, magazines and ed-
ucational materials in addition to oral traditions.
There is some effort afoot to document record and
archive endangered languages. Documentation
may involve creation of dictionaries, thesauruses,
text and speech corpora. One possible way to re-
suscitate these languages is to make them more
easily learnable for the younger generation. To

learn languages and use them well, tools such as
dictionaries and thesauruses are essential. Dictio-
naries are resources that empower the users and
learners of a language. Dictionaries play a more
substantial role than usual for endangered lan-
guages and are “an instrument of language main-
tenance” (Gippert et al., 2006). Thesauruses are
resources that group words according to similarity
(Kilgarriff, 2003). For speakers and students of an
endangered language, multilingual thesauruses are
also likely to be very helpful.
This study focuses on examining techniques
that leverage existing resources for “resource-
rich” languages to build lexical resources for low-
resource languages, especially endangered lan-
guages. The only resource we need is a single
available bilingual dictionary translating the given
endangered language to English. First, we create a
reverse dictionary from the input dictionary using
the approach in (Lam and Kalita, 2013). Then, we
generate additional bilingual dictionaries translat-
ing from the given endangered language to sev-
eral additional languages. Finally, we discuss the
first steps to constructing multilingual thesauruses
encompassing endangered and resources-rich lan-
guages. To handle the word sense ambiguity prob-
lems, we exploit Wordnets in several languages.
We experiment with two endangered languages:
Cherokee and Cheyenne, and some resource-rich
languages such as English, Finnish, French and
Japanese2. Cherokee is the Iroquoian language
spoken by 16,000 Cherokee people in Oklahoma
and North Carolina. Cheyenne is a Native Ameri-
can language spoken by 2,100 Cheyenne people in
Montana and Oklahoma.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Dictionaries and thesauruses are introduced
in Section 2. Section 3 discusses related work. In

2 Dictionaries vs. Thesauruses
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944170731707">
A dictionary or a lexicon is a book (now, in elec-
tronic database formats as well) that consists of a
list of entries sorted by the lexical unit. A lexical
unit is a word or phrase being defined, also called
definiendum. A dictionary entry or a lexical en-
try simply contains a lexical unit and a definition
(Landau, 1984). Given a lexical unit, the defini-
tion associated with it usually contains parts-of-
speech (POS), pronunciations, meanings, exam-
ple sentences showing the use of the source words
and possibly additional information. A monolin-
gual dictionary contains only one language such
as The Oxford English Dictionary3 while a bilin-
gual dictionary consists of two languages such as
the English-Cheyenne dictionary4. A lexical entry
in the bilingual dictionary contains a lexical unit in
a source language and equivalent words or multi-
word expressions in the target language along with
optional additional information. A bilingual dic-
tionary may be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Thesauruses are specialized dictionaries that
store synonyms and antonyms of selected words
in a language. Thus, a thesaurus is a resource
that groups words according to similarity (Kilgar-
riff, 2003). However, a thesaurus is different from
a dictionary. (Roget, 1911) describes the orga-
nizes of words in a thesaurus as “... not in alpha-
betical order as they are in a dictionary, but ac-
cording to the ideas which they express.... The
idea being given, to find the word, or words, by
which that idea may be most fitly and aptly ex-
pressed. For this purpose, the words and phrases
of the language are here classed, not according to
their sound or their orthography, but strictly ac-
cording to their signification”. Particularly, a the-
saurus contains a set of descriptors, an indexing
language, a classification scheme or a system vo-
cabulary (Soergel, 1974). A thesaurus also con-
sists of relationships among descriptors. Each de-
scriptor is a term, a notation or another string of
symbols used to designate the concept. Examples

of thesauruses are Roget’s international Thesaurus
(Roget, 2008), the Open Thesaurus5 or the one at
thesaurus.com.
We believe that the lexical resources we create
are likely to help endangered languages in sev-
eral ways. These can be educational tools for lan-
guage learning within and outside the community
of speakers of the language. The dictionaries and
thesauruses we create can be of help in developing
parsers for these languages, in addition to assisting
machine or human translators to translate rich oral
or possibly limited written traditions of these lan-
guages into other languages. We may be also able
to construct mini pocket dictionaries for travelers
and students.

Previous approaches to create new bilingual dic-
tionaries use intermediate dictionaries to find
chains of words with the same meaning. Then,
several approaches are used to mitigate the ef-
fect of ambiguity. These include consulting the
dictionary in the reverse direction (Tanaka and
Umemura, 1994) and computing ranking scores,
variously called a semantic score (Bond and
Ogura, 2008), an overlapping constraint score, a
similarity score (Paik et al., 2004) and a con-
verse mapping score (Shaw et al., 2013). Other
techniques to handle the ambiguity problem are
merging results from several approaches: merging
candidates from lexical triangulation (Gollins and
Sanderson, 2001), creating a link structure among
words (Ahn and Frampton, 2006) and building
graphs connecting translations of words in sev-
eral languages (Mausam et al., 2010). Researchers
also merge information from several sources such
as bilingual dictionaries and corpora (Otero and
Campos, 2010) or a Wordnet (István and Shoichi,
2009) and (Lam and Kalita, 2013). Some re-
searchers also extract bilingual dictionaries from
corpora (Ljubeši´c and Fišer, 2011) and (Bouamor
et al., 2013). The primary similarity among these
methods is that either they work with languages
that already possess several lexical resources or
these approaches take advantage of related lan-
guages (that have some lexical resources) by using
such languages as intermediary. The accuracies of
bilingual dictionaries created from several avail-
able dictionaries and Wordnets are usually high.
However, it is expensive to create such original

lexical resources and they do not always exist for
many languages. For instance, we cannot find any
Wordnet for chr or chy. In addition, these exist-
ing approaches can only generate one or just a few
new bilingual dictionaries from at least two exist-
ing bilingual dictionaries.
(Crouch, 1990) clusters documents first using
a complete link clustering algorithm and gener-
ates thesaurus classes or synonym lists based on
user-supplied parameters such as a threshold sim-
ilarity value, number of documents in a cluster,
minimum document frequency and specification
of a class formation method. (Curran and Moens,
2002a) and (Curran and Moens, 2002b) evaluate
performance and efficiency of thesaurus extrac-
tion methods and also propose an approximation
method that provides for better time complexity
with little loss in performance accuracy. (Ramírez
et al., 2013) develop a multilingual Japanese-
English-Spanish thesaurus using freely available
resources: Wikipedia and Wordnet. They extract
translation tuples from Wikipedia from articles in
these languages, disambiguate them by mapping
to Wordnet senses, and extract a multilingual the-
saurus with a total of 25,375 entries.
One thing to note about all these approaches is
that they are resource hungry. For example, (Lin,
1998) works with a 64-million word English cor-
pus to produce a high quality thesaurus with about
10,000 entries. (Ramírez et al., 2013) has the en-
tire Wikipedia at their disposal with millions of
articles in three languages, although for experi-
ments they use only about 13,000 articles in total.
When we work with endangered or low-resource
languages, we do not have the luxury of collecting
such big corpora or accessing even a few thousand
articles from Wikipedia or the entire Web. Many
such languages have no or very limited Web pres-
ence. As a result, we have to work with whatever
limited resources are available.

<bodyText confidence="0.999266571428571">
A dictionary Dict(S,T) between a source language
S and a target language T has a list of entries. Each
entry contains a word s in the source language S,
part-of-speech (POS) and one or more translations
in the target language T. We call such a transla-
tion t. Thus, a dictionary entry is of the form
&lt;si,POS,ti1&gt;, &lt;si,POS,ti2&gt;, ....
This section examines approaches to create new
bilingual dictionaries for endangered languages
from just one dictionary Dict(S,I), where S is the
endangered source language and I is an “inter-
mediate helper” language. We require that the
language I has an available Wordnet linked to
the Princeton Wordnet (PWN) (Fellbaum, 1998).
Many endangered languages have a bilingual dic-
tionary, usually to or from a resource-rich lan-
guage like French or English which is the inter-
mediate helper language in our experiments. We
make an assumption that we can find only one uni-
directional bilingual dictionary translating from a
given endangered language to English.

Given a unidirectional dictionary Dict(S,I) or
Dict(I,S), we reverse the direction of the entries
to produce Dict(I,S) or Dict(S,I), respectively. We
apply an approach called Direct Reversal with
Similarity (DRwS), proposed in (Lam and Kalita,
2013) to create a reverse bilingual dictionary from
an input dictionary.
The DRwS approach computes the distance be-
tween translations of entries by measuring their se-
mantic similarity, the so-called simValue. The sim-
Value between two phrases is calculated by com-
paring the similarity of the ExpansionSet for ev-
ery word in one phrase with ExpansionSet of ev-
ery word in the other phrase. An ExpansionSet of
a phrase is a union of the synset, synonym set, hy-
ponym set, and/or hypernym set of every word in
it. The synset, synonym, hyponym and hypernym
sets of a word are obtained from PWN. The greater
is the simValue between two phrases, the more se-
mantically similar are these phrases. According to
(Lam and Kalita, 2013), if the simValue is equal to
or greater than 0.9, the DRwS approach produces
the “best” reverse dictionary.
For creating a reverse dictionary, we skip en-
tries with multiword expression in the translation.
Based on our experiments, we have found that ap-
proach is successful and hence, it may be an effec-
tive way to automatically create a new bilingual
dictionary from an existing one. Figure 1 presents
an example of generating entries for the reverse
dictionary.

For each entry pair (s,e) in a given dictionary
Dict(S,eng), we find all synonym words of the
word e to create a list of synonym words in En-
glish: SYNeng. SYNeng of the word eng is
obtained from the PWN. Then, we find all syn-
onyms of words belonging to SYNeng in sev-
eral non-English languages to generate SYNL,
L E {fin, fra, jpn}. SYNL in the language L is
extracted from the publicly available Wordnet in
language L linked to the PWN. Next, translation
candidates are generated by translating all words
in SYNL, L E {eng, fin, fra, jpn} to the target
language T using an MT. A translation candidate is
considered a correct translation of the source word
in the target language if its rank is greater than a
threshold. For each word s, we may have many
candidates. A translation candidate with a higher
rank is more likely to become a correct translation
in the target language. The rank of a candidate is
computed by dividing its occurrence count by the
total number of candidates. Figure 3 shows an ex-
ample of creating entries for Dict(chr,vie), where

generate SYNeng and all synonyms in fin, fra and

all words in all SYNLs to vie and rank them. Ac-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999470944444444">
As previously mentioned, we want to generate a
multilingual thesaurus THS composed of endan-
gered and resource-rich languages. For example,
we build the thesaurus encompassing an endan-
gered language S and eng, fin, fra and jpn. Our
thesaurus contains a list of entries. Every entry has
a unique ID. Each entry is a 7-tuple: ID, SYNS,
SYNeng, SYNfin, SYNfra, SY Njpn and POS.
Each SYNL contains words that have the same
sense in language L. All SYNL, L ∈ {S, eng, fin,
fra, jpn} with the same ID have the same sense.
This section presents the initial steps in con-
structing multilingual thesauruses using Wordnets
and the bilingual dictionaries we create. The
approach to create a multilingual thesaurus en-
compassing an endangered language and several
resource-rich languages is presented in Figure 4

SY Njpn (lines 7-10). The POS of the entry is
the POS extracted from the Offset-POS (line 5).
Since these Wordnets are aligned, a specific offset-
POS retrieves synsets that are equivalent sense-
wise. Then, we translate all SY NLs to the given
endangered language S using bilingual dictionar-
ies we created in the previous section (lines 11-

add the correct translations to SY NS (lines 15-

viding its occurrence count by the total number of
candidates. If a candidate has a rank value greater
than a threshold, we accept it as a correct transla-
tion and add it to SYNS.

a new Dict(chy,eng) using the DR approach from
the created dictionary Dict(eng,chy). Finally, we
integrate the generated dictionary Dict(chy,eng)
with the input dictionary Dict(chy,eng) to create a
new dictionary Dict(chy,eng) with a greater num-
ber of entries
The number of entries in the integrated dictio-
naries Dict(chr,eng) and Dict(chy,eng) are 3,618
and 47,529, respectively. Thus, the number of en-
tries in the original dictionaries have &amp;quot;magically&amp;quot;
increased by 13.1% and 69.21%, respectively.

Currently, we are not able to evaluate the dictio-

expect to evaluate our work using two methods.
First, we will use the standard approach which is
human evaluation to evaluate resources as previ-
ously mentioned. Second, we will try to find an
additional bilingual dictionary translating from an
endangered language S (viz., chr or chy) to another
“resource-rich” non-English language (viz., fin or
fra), then, create a new dictionary translating from
S to English using the approaches we have intro-
duced. We plan to evaluate the new dictionary we
create, say Dict(chr,eng) against the existing dic-
tionary Dict(chr,eng).

run experiments with two endangered languages:
Cherokee and Cheyenne. We have also experi-
mented with two additional endangered languages
from Northeast India: Dimasa and Karbi, spo-
ken by about 115,000 and 492,000 people, respec-
tively. We believe that our research has the po-
tential to increase the number of lexical resources
for languages which do not have many existing re-
sources to begin with. We are in the process of
creating reverse dictionaries from bilingual dictio-
naries we have already created. We are also in
the process of creating a Website where all dic-
tionaries and thesauruses we create will be avail-
able, along with a user friendly interface to dis-
seminate these resources to the wider public as
well as to obtain feedback on individual entries.
We will solicit feedback from communities that
use the languages as mother-tongues. Our goal
will be to use this feedback to improve the qual-
ity of the dictionaries and thesauruses. Some of
resources we created can be downloaded from

One possible way to resuscitate these languages is to make them more easily learnable for the younger generation. To 1http://www.ethnologue.com/ learn languages and use them well, tools such as dictionaries and thesauruses are essential. Dictionaries are resources that empower the users and learners of a language. Dictionaries play a more substantial role than usual for endangered languages and are “an instrument of language maintenance” (Gippert et al., 2006). Thesauruses are resources that group words according to similarity (Kilgarriff, 2003). For speakers and students of an endangered language, multilingual thesauruses are also likely to be very helpful. This study focuses on examining techniques that leverage existing resources for “resourcerich” languages to build lexical resources for lowresource languages, especially endangered languages. The only resource we need is a single available bilingual dictionary translating the given endangered language to English. First, we create a reverse dictionary from the input dictionary using the approach in (Lam and Kalita, 2013). Then, we generate additional bilingual dictionaries transla</context>

A lexical entry in the bilingual dictionary contains a lexical unit in a source language and equivalent words or multiword expressions in the target language along with optional additional information. A bilingual dictionary may be unidirectional or bidirectional. Thesauruses are specialized dictionaries that store synonyms and antonyms of selected words in a language. Thus, a thesaurus is a resource that groups words according to similarity (Kilgarriff, 2003). However, a thesaurus is different from a dictionary. (Roget, 1911) describes the organizes of words in a thesaurus as “... not in alphabetical order as they are in a dictionary, but according to the ideas which they express.... The idea being given, to find the word, or words, by which that idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed. For this purpose, the words and phrases of the language are here classed, not according to their sound or their orthography, but strictly according to their signification”.

Figure 4: The approach to construct a multilingual thesaurus encompassing an endangered language S and resource-rich language. First, we extract SYNL in resource-rich languages from Wordnets. To extract SY Neng, SY Nfin, SY Nfra and SY Njpn, we use PWN and Wordnets linked to the PWN provided by the Open Multilingual Wordnet6 project (Bond and Foster, 2013): FinnWordnet (FWN) (Lindén, 2010), WOLF (WWN) (Sagot and Fišer, 2008) and JapaneseWordnet (JWN) (Isahara et al., 2008).

The POS of the entry is the POS extracted from the Offset-POS (line 5). Since these Wordnets are aligned, a specific offsetPOS retrieves synsets that are equivalent sensewise. Then, we translate all SY NLs to the given endangered language S using bilingual dictionaries we created in the previous section (lines 11- 14). Finally, we rank translation candidates an</context>

(Ramírez et al., 2013) develop a multilingual JapaneseEnglish-Spanish thesaurus using freely available resources: Wikipedia and Wordnet. They extract translation tuples from Wikipedia from articles in these languages, disambiguate them by mapping to Wordnet senses, and extract a multilingual thesaurus with a total of 25,375 entries. One thing to note about all these approaches is that they are resource hungry. For example, (Lin, 1998) works with a 64-million word English corpus to produce a high quality thesaurus with about 10,000 entries. (Ramírez et al., 2013) has the entire Wikipedia at their disposal with millions of articles in three languages, although for experiments they use only about 13,000 articles in total.

Figure 4: The approach to construct a multilingual thesaurus encompassing an endangered language S and resource-rich language. First, we extract SYNL in resource-rich languages from Wordnets. To extract SY Neng, SY Nfin, SY Nfra and SY Njpn, we use PWN and Wordnets linked to the PWN provided by the Open Multilingual Wordnet6 project (Bond and Foster, 2013): FinnWordnet (FWN) (Lindén, 2010), WOLF (WWN) (Sagot and Fišer, 2008) and JapaneseWordnet (JWN) (Isahara et al., 2008). For each Offset-POS, we extract its corresponding synsets from PWN, FWN, WWN and 6http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/ JWN to generate SY Neng, SY Nfin, SY Nfra and SY Njpn (lines 7-10). The POS of the entry is the POS extracted from the Offset-POS (line 5). Since these Wordnets are aligned, a specific offsetPOS retrieves synsets that are equivalent sensewise.

For speakers and students of an endangered language, multilingual thesauruses are also likely to be very helpful. This study focuses on examining techniques that leverage existing resources for “resourcerich” languages to build lexical resources for lowresource languages, especially endangered languages. The only resource we need is a single available bilingual dictionary translating the given endangered language to English. First, we create a reverse dictionary from the input dictionary using the approach in (Lam and Kalita, 2013). Then, we generate additional bilingual dictionaries translating from the given endangered language to several additional languages. Finally, we discuss the first steps to constructing multilingual thesauruses encompassing endangered and resources-rich languages. To handle the word sense ambiguity problems, we exploit Wordnets in several languages. We experiment with two endangered languages: Cherokee and Cheyenne, and some resource-rich languages such as English, Finnish, French and Japanese2. Cherokee is the Iroquoian language spoken by 16,000 Cherokee people in Oklahoma and North Carolina.</context>

Researchers also merge information from several sources such as bilingual dictionaries and corpora (Otero and Campos, 2010) or a Wordnet (István and Shoichi, 2009) and (Lam and Kalita, 2013). Some researchers also extract bilingual dictionaries from corpora (Ljubeši´c and Fišer, 2011) and (Bouamor et al., 2013). The primary similarity among these methods is that either they work with languages that already possess several lexical resources or these approaches take advantage of related languages (that have some lexical resources) by using such languages as intermediary. The accuracies of bilingual dictionaries created from several available dictionaries and Wordnets are usually high. However, it is expensive to create such original 5http://www.openthesaurus.de/ 55 lexical resource</context>

We make an assumption that we can find only one unidirectional bilingual dictionary translating from a given endangered language to English. 4.1 Generating a reverse bilingual dictionary Given a unidirectional dictionary Dict(S,I) or Dict(I,S), we reverse the direction of the entries to produce Dict(I,S) or Dict(S,I), respectively. We apply an approach called Direct Reversal with Similarity (DRwS), proposed in (Lam and Kalita, 2013) to create a reverse bilingual dictionary from an input dictionary. The DRwS approach computes the distance between translations of entries by measuring their semantic similarity, the so-called simValue. The simValue between two phrases is calculated by comparing the similarity of the ExpansionSet for every word in one phrase with ExpansionSet of every word in the other phrase. An ExpansionSet of a phrase is a union of the synset, synonym set, hyponym set, and/or hypernym set of every word in it. The synset, synonym, hyponym and hypernym sets of a word are obtained from PWN. The greater is the</context>

During the process of generating new reverse dictionaries, we already computed the semantic similarity values among words to find words with the same meanings. We use a simple approach called the Direct Reversal (DR) approach in (Lam and Kalita, 2013) to create 7http://www.manataka.org/page122.html 8http://www.cdkc.edu/cheyennedictionary/indexenglish/index.htm 9https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/microsofttranslator 59 these RR dictionaries. To create a reverse dictionary Dict(T,S), the DR approach takes each entry &lt;s,POS,t&gt; in the input dictionary Dict(S,T) and simply swaps the positions of s and t. The new entry &lt;t,POS,s&gt; is added into Dict(T,S). Figure 7 presents an example.

Other techniques to handle the ambiguity problem are merging results from several approaches: merging candidates from lexical triangulation (Gollins and Sanderson, 2001), creating a link structure among words (Ahn and Frampton, 2006) and building graphs connecting translations of words in several languages (Mausam et al., 2010).

A lexical entry in the bilingual dictionary contains a lexical unit in a source language and equivalent words or multiword expressions in the target language along with optional additional information. A bilingual dictionary may be unidirectional or bidirectional. Thesauruses are specialized dictionaries that store synonyms and antonyms of selected words in a language. Thus, a thesaurus is a resource that groups words according to similarity (Kilgarriff, 2003). However, a thesaurus is different from a dictionary. (Roget, 1911) describes the organizes of words in a thesaurus as “... not in alphabetical order as they are in a dictionary, but according to the ideas which they express.... The idea being given, to find the word, or words, by which that idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed. For this purpose, the words and phrases of the language are here classed, not according to their sound or their orthography, but strictly according to their signification”. Particularly, a thesaurus contains a set of descriptors, an indexing language, a classification scheme or a system vocabulary (Soergel, 1974). A thesaurus al</context>

Particularly, a thesaurus contains a set of descriptors, an indexing language, a classification scheme or a system vocabulary (Soergel, 1974). A thesaurus also consists of relationships among descriptors. Each descriptor is a term, a notation or another string of symbols used to designate the concept. Examples 3http://www.oed.com/ 4http://cdkc.edu/cheyennedictionary/indexenglish/index.htm of thesauruses are Roget’s international Thesaurus (Roget, 2008), the Open Thesaurus5 or the one at thesaurus.com. We believe that the lexical resources we create are likely to help endangered languages in several ways. These can be educational tools for language learning within and outside the community of speakers of the language. The dictionaries and thesauruses we create can be of help in developing parsers for these languages, in addition to assisting machine or human translators to translate rich oral or possibly limited written traditions of these languages into other languages.

Then, several approaches are used to mitigate the effect of ambiguity. These include consulting the dictionary in the reverse direction (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) and computing ranking scores, variously called a semantic score (Bond and Ogura, 2008), an overlapping constraint score, a similarity score (Paik et al., 2004) and a converse mapping score (Shaw et al., 2013).

Experiments are described in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2 Dictionaries vs. Thesauruses A dictionary or a lexicon is a book (now, in electronic database formats as well) that consists of a list of entries sorted by the lexical unit. A lexical unit is a word or phrase being defined, also called definiendum. A dictionary entry or a lexical entry simply contains a lexical unit and a definition (Landau, 1984). Given a lexical unit, the definition associated with it usually contains parts-ofspeech (POS), pronunciations, meanings, example sentences showing the use of the source words and possibly additional information. A monolingual dictionary contains only one language such as The Oxford English Dictionary3 while a bilingual dictionary consists of two languages such as the English-Cheyenne dictionary4.

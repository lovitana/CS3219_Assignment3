The prospect of human commanders teaming with mobile robots “smart enough” to under-
take joint exploratory tasks—especially tasks that neither commander nor robot could perform
alone—requires novel methods of preparing and testing human-robot teams for these ventures
prior to real-time operations. In this paper, we report work-in-progress that maintains face valid-
ity of selected configurations of resources and people, as would be available in emergency cir-
cumstances. More specifically, from an off-site post, we ask human commanders (C) to perform
an exploratory task in collaboration with a remotely located human robot-navigator (Rn) who
controls the navigation of, but cannot see the physical robot (R). We impose network bandwidth
restrictions in two mission scenarios comparable to real circumstances by varying the availabil-
ity of sensor, image, and video signals to Rn, in effect limiting the human Rn to function as an
automation stand-in. To better understand the capabilities and language required in such con-
figurations, we constructed multi-modal corpora of time-synced dialog, video, and LIDAR files
recorded during task sessions. We can now examine commander/robot dialogs while replaying
what C and Rn saw, to assess their task performance under these varied conditions.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.959436714285715">
Our research addresses a paradoxical situation in developing a robot capable of teaming with humans.
To know what capabilities such a robot needs, we seek to determine how a human commander would in-
teract — choice of vocabulary and sentence types, expected capabilities and world knowledge, resources
used to accomplish tasks efficiently, etc. But without such a robot to interact with, we cannot know
how a commander would behave. The prospect of human commanders teaming with mobile robots that
are “smart enough” to undertake joint exploratory tasks requires novel methods of preparing and testing
actual human-robot teams for these ventures, in advance of actual real-time operations. Furthermore,
given the need for human/robot teams during emergencies (such as Japan’s tsunami/Fukishima disaster),
we are interested in particular in the feasibility of commander/robot shared tasks that include NL com-
munication specifically for network contexts when bandwidth is limited by emergencies. Here we ask,
how can multimodal data, as collected and processed by robots, and the robots themselves contribute
real-time alerts and responses to human commanders over geographically-distributed networks?
The first phase of our approach is to introduce a human stand-in who navigates the robot, posing as
an intelligent control system. At this stage, following our prior work (Voss et al., 2014), we seek to
determine how the commander communicates to accomplish different tasks with the robot, while we
limit the information made available in passing from the robot’s sensors and camera to the commander
by way of the stand-in. In future phases, we will progressively automate away this actor’s role, replacing
the audio that the stand-in hears with what is “understood” by automatic natural language semantic
interpretation within a dialog manager, and replacing the joystick that it uses to navigate as the robot

with “actions” as automatically generated from micro-controller commands produced by transformation
of semantic commands.
In this paper, we report work-in-progress that maintains face validity of selected configurations of re-
sources and people, as would be available in emergency circumstances. From an off-site post, we ask
human commanders (C) to perform an exploratory task in collaboration with a remotely located human
robot-navigator (Rn) who actually controls the navigation of, but cannot see, the physical robot (R). We
restrict the information Rn receives from R by imposing network bandwidth restrictions comparable to
real circumstances which limit what Rn is able to communicate to C. We then examine the comman-
der/robot dialogs and task performance under these varied conditions.
To better understand the capabilities and language required in such configurations, we constructed
multi-modal corpora of time-synced dialog, video, and LIDAR files recorded during task sessions. We
can now examine commander/robot dialogs while replaying what C and Rn saw, to identify the impact
of varying the shared visual information on discourse, and to assess task performance under these var-
ied conditions. We hypothesized that more explicit, mututally available information (visual or verbal)
between participants would yield better understanding with more common ground, leading to more task
success. We also hypothesized that exploration in a more complex physical environment would lead both
to more dialog, as needed in resolving references to more locations, and also then on occasion, to less
overall task success. We have found in preliminary analyses that, with more explicit visual information,
some Cs reduce their level of communication, with fewer requests for images from Rn. In one such case,
this led to the Rn getting lost. We also noticed that some Cs increased their level of verbal communica-
tion, requesting far more still images from the robot when Rn could not itself see the robot’s images (as
opposed to when Rn had access to sent images). Taken together, these observations suggest—contrary to
our hypothesis that more information is better, especially in a complex environment—that there may be
a “teeter totter” effect in the communication between C and Rn as visual information varies. When Rn
has access to more of the robot’s visual information, C communicates less with Rn, possibly assuming
more shared information than is correct. Whereas when Rn is able to see less, C communicates more
with Rn, possibly compensating for the lack of certainty Rn expresses.

For human-robot communication in joint exploration tasks, we wish to understand two issues. The
first is “scene to text”: when exploring new locations, how do people talk about what they see, and
how does that inform how they want robot team members to communicate about what they “see” while
exploring? The second is “text to scene”: given natural language instructions, how do people move about
in new locations, and how does that impact their expectations of robot navigation? These issues span
both generation and understanding of spatial language. There exists a large literature on spatial language,
starting several decades ago (Talmy, 1983; Anderson et al., 1991; Gurney et al., 1996; Bloom et al., 1996;
Olivier and Gapp, 1998) inter alia. This work yielded linguistic insights into the underlying structure of
spatial expressions, that has led more recently to annotation efforts like SpaceML (Morarescu, 2006) and
spatial role labeling (Kordjamshidi et al., 2010). These results, theoretical and computational, have been
incorporated into NLP research, such as spoken dialog systems (Meena et al., 2014).
For “scene to text” processing, starting from a robot’s perception of the scene or environment, ex-
ploiting even known dependencies among objects (spatial relations, relative motion, etc.) is a central
problem in computer vision research. In the current state of robotics, the perceived world (a.k.a. se-
mantic perception) derived from data collected by the robot is limited by what is available within its
immediate sensor and video reach (Hebert et al., 2012). Within computational linguistic research, (Feng
and Lapata, 2013) have tackled going from news images to text, leveraging the news story content as
contextual knowledge, and automatically generating captions describing the image content as relevant
for the story. For “text to scene” processing, a robot “understanding” a commander’s language entails
going beyond linguistic semantic interpretation down to the the robot controller level, as in, for example,
Kress-Gazit et al. (2008). Within computational linguistics, Srihari and Burhans (1994) tackled going
from text to images, exploiting the conventions and spatial language in news caption to identify people

by their relative positions in accompanying images. More recently Coyne et al. (2011) presented work
for text-to-graphics generation, grounding conceptual knowledge in relational semantic encoding of lex-
ical meanings from FrameNet. These one-way, directional approaches provide strong evidence that text
and image modalities can each inform the processing of the other, and that, with concurrent audio and
video streaming data, the alignment of time-stamped files across the two data modalities should also
yield additional benefits in shared structural analyses and disambiguating references.1

<bodyText confidence="0.92106852631579">
In previous work, we had teams search a series of buildings, where all information from the Rn to C was
strictly limited to text (Voss et al., 2014). While verbal descriptions of scenery were successfully elicited
during exploratory missions, the communication was painfully slow and this scenario yielded unrealistic
results from our stand-in: we would not expect a robot to generate the complex verbal descriptions we
collected. Furthermore we also learned that our equipment could be adjusted for transmission of LIDAR
map data and video stream from the robot to Rn and then to C. In this second study, we allowed individual
map and image updates to be sent to C, but only on request. This work provides more explicitly shared
knowledge between C and Rn, with its form and quantity more realistically varied and dynamic.
Equipment: We used an iRobot PackBot equipped with a forward-facing Kinect camera and a Hokuyo
LIDAR sensor.2 We use GPS and inertial sensors for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
Each participant had their own laptop with speakers and separate push-to-talk microphones. For navigat-
ing the robot, the Rn pushed a joystick on an X-box controller that was held. Additionally for transmitting
visual information available from the robot during the missions, the Rn pushed separate buttons on the
same controller to transfer image and map data to C, but only at C’s request.
Pre-pilot Design: We conducted training sessions at one location and test sessions at a second loca-
tion. A top down view of these sites is provided in Figure 1. We asked participants to perform distinct
missions (task conditions) in the training and test sessions, with different levels of visual information
available to Rn (vision conditions). Due to wireless networking timeouts and hardware integration diffi-
culties, a number of sessions ended prematurely. Descriptive statistics for the sessions are in Table 1.

Vision Conditions: The Rn always saw (i) a continuously updated LIDAR map built up progressively
from the robot’s sensors as the Rn navigated the robot using the joystick on an X-box controller. On the
map during training, the Rn could also see (ii) an avatar shape for the robot’s location based on GPS and
(iii) an arrow for the robot’s facing direction generated by its internal components (updated intermittently
by GPS). However the GPS signal was also sporadic during these sessions, causing confusion for Rn
navigating the robot. As a result, during test sessions, we turned off the GPS to avoid this source of
confusion, mirroring what actual operators do in this scenario. During test sessions, the Rn only saw
(iii) the arrow, again within (i) the streamed LIDAR map. Beyond these Rn screen specifics, we ran
three conditions controlling for the visual information that the C and Rn could see. During mission 1
(training), Rn was given “full” view of the streaming video, any specific images sent to C at C’s request,
and the map with arrow and avatar. During mission 2 (test) in one “partially blinded” condition, the Rn

saw no video, but could see the specific images he sent to C as well as the map with arrow, and in the
other even “more blinded” condition, Rn saw only the map with arrow. By contrast, the C only ever saw
what the Rn sent (by pushing buttons) as snapshots at C’s request. During all conditions — independent
of what was presented to Rn (“full’ view in mission 1, partially blinded or more-blinded in mission 2) —
C could always request an updated snapshot image from the video feed or an updated snapshot map from
the LIDAR feed or both. As a result, Rn’s view was “pushed” and current from the robot’s streaming
data, whereas the C’s view had to be “pulled,” requiring C to ask for more snapshots. Note that in Rn’s
more-blinded condition, images were passed to C with Rn’s button push, but Rn could not see the images.
Mission 1: Enter courtyard and building via safe doorways. We hypothesized a robot with the ability
to carry on limited conversation regarding simple navigation and exploration, but without sufficient vi-
sion capabilities to analyze more subtle clues about whether a doorway was safe to enter. We designed
the task to simulate a low-bandwidth condition where constant transmission of the map and video infor-
mation is impossible. The robot was placed in one of two undisclosed positions outside the courtyard
surrounding a building. All sessions adopted the L+I+V vision condition. The site for this mission was a

single rectangular building enclosed by a single rectangular courtyard. The site for mission 2 was more
complex, consisting of 5 buildings in a complex series of interconnected courtyards (see Figure 1). There
are five doorways into the courtyard and two doorways into the building. These doorways are marked as
safe or unsafe in a way that C can recognize but Rn cannot (C is given a key to the meaning of objects
placed just beyond open doorways as symbols). The participants are not informed about doorway loca-
tion or safety status. Figure 2 shows Rn’s screen during a mission 1 session. The grey-scale background
is an overhead, 2D view of a 3D map being built on the fly by combining various sensor data, which
contains a white robot avatar and blue arrow indicating its current pose. C’s view is similar, but without
video. Success on this task was gauged by whether the robot stayed safe in gaining entry to the house.
Mission 2: Find and classify all building doorways within a compound.
As noted above and shown in Figure 1, the location in this mission had a more complex layout. The
robot’s location within the compound was not disclosed to C nor Rn (no clues were provided), so that
the C and Rn team would need to work hard to place the robot on the map. The team was tasked with
thoroughly exploring the compound to capture images of each building doorway. In the LIDAR-only (L)
condition, Rn sees only the grey-scale map, whereas in the LIDAR and image condition (L+I) Rn sees
the most recently sent image as well as the grey-scale map (same screen layout as in Figure 2 but without
video window in upper right). Success on this mission was gauged both by the number of doors (open or
closed) that were identified and photographed and by whether the participants were lost at some stage in
the exploration.

4.2 Language Phenomena in Dialogs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998679384615385">
Referring Expressions: There were few named environment features, necessitating the use of referring
expressions. Participants often used pronouns (‘behind it’), deictic expressions (‘that wall’), and both
definite and indefinite noun phrase descriptors (‘a wall directly in front of you’). The frequency of
referring expressions other than proper names highlights the need for a dialog manager to robustly handle
human-robot dialog in our setting. In six mission 2 dialogs consisting of 6,593 words total, we annotated
1,593 referring expressions - 1,213 definite and 380 indefinite. The most common were first and second
person singular pronouns (287 and 245), definite expressions of the form the x (265) and indefinite
expressions of the form a(n) x (256). Most references are to things, either in the physical (‘face the
doorway’) or software (‘update your map’) environment, though there are references to events as well
(‘do that again’).
Lexical Ambiguity: The same objects were sometimes referred to as ‘doors’ or ‘doorways,’ although by
a dictionary definition, those refer to somewhat different things. Based on context, the robot would need
to be able to understand which sense was intended.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997764">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998727857142857">
Spatial Relations: Since these were navigation and observation tasks, much of the discussion involved
spatial language pertaining to object configurations and robot paths. There were references to distances
and angles, both specific (‘turn 15 degrees to your right’) and vague (‘turn around.’) The robot was asked
to ‘follow the wall’, ‘go north’, and to travel ‘around,’ ‘behind,’ and ‘near’ various objects.
Clarifications and Suggestions in Dialogs: When uncertain about the meaning of commands, Rn some-
times asked for clarification. At other times, Rn reminded C of its capabilities when appropriate: ‘Would
you like me to send you an updated map?’

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999293">
4.3 The Role of Shared Visual Information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970846153846">
Participants were generally able to use both image and map data in conjunction with dialog to gain
enough common ground to communicate about the environment and accomplish the tasks at hand. For
example, after discussing environment features against the backdrop of an updated 2D map, we were
often surprised at the extent to which C apparently kept track of R’s location using dialog alone without
further map updates, as evidenced by C’s ability to correctly use Rn’s egocentric frame of reference in
verbal descriptions (recall that the robot avatar remained static on C’s map between updates). In such
cases C and R took advantage of mutually accessible visual information - their 2D maps were identical
during discussion. The role of mutually accessible information for achieiving common ground is further
supported by the fact that C requested significantly more images in the LIDAR-only condition, when
Rn could not see those sent images (see Table 3). Although shared visual knowledge proved useful for
resolving referring expressions, C and Rn rarely mentioned the media explicitly (’the building’ vs ’the
building in the image you sent me’). In this way, the transfer of visual information served to introduce
entities into their discourse, but was taken for granted and not called out per se.

We have found in preliminary analyses that, with more explicit visual information, some Cs reduce their
level of communication, with fewer requests for images from Rn. In one such case, this led to the Rn
getting lost. We also noticed that some Cs increased their level of verbal communication, requesting far
more still images from the robot when Rn could not itself see the robot’s images (as opposed to when
Rn had access to sent images). Taken together, these observations suggest—contrary to our hypotheses
that more information is better, especially in a complex environment—that there may be a “teeter totter”
effect in the communication between C and Rn as visual information varies. When Rn “sees as the robot”
with access to more transmitted visual information, C communicates less with Rn, possibly assuming
more shared information than is correct. Whereas when Rn “sees” less, C communicates more with
Rn, possibly compensating for the lack of certainty Rn expresses. We plan to extend our analysis of
how C and Rn communicate uncertainty, and look at how this topic is addressed in first aid and military
manuals (US Dept. of the Army, 1993).
We are currently developing a framework to automate many of the tasks currently performed by Rn.
Our studies and data collections so far are best understood in the context of the capabilities and limitations
of the overall system we are in the process of building. A crucial gap to address is associating referring
expressions with corresponding concrete spatial structures in the 3D map. Consider one sentence spoken
by the commander in one of the dialogues: “When you get to the wall, turn left and drive along the wall
until you reach either a corner or what you believe to be a door.” To interpret this correctly, the robot
must understand an entire set of points as a single object or part of an object, so it can recognize doors,
walls, and corners in the combined vision and point-cloud. Moreover, it needs to plan a path that obeys
the constraint ”along the wall” and stops at some point which may be a door or a corner, that has not
yet been observed. Thus, objects need to be represented independent of the observed world map.4 At
present, scene parsing techniques can analyze images and assign each pixel a probability of belonging to
a particular object class (wall, stucco, road, etc.) allowing us to propagate these labels to corresponding
points in the 3D model of the scene. In the future, we will use the 3D model to resolve visual ambiguities
and attach labels to particular objects that persist from one video frame to the next.

<abstract confidence="0.998958933333333">The prospect of human commanders teaming with mobile robots “smart enough” to undertake joint exploratory tasks—especially tasks that neither commander nor robot could perform alone—requires novel methods of preparing and testing human-robot teams for these ventures prior to real-time operations. In this paper, we report work-in-progress that maintains face validity of selected configurations of resources and people, as would be available in emergency circumstances. More specifically, from an off-site post, we ask human commanders (C) to perform an exploratory task in collaboration with a remotely located human robot-navigator (Rn) who controls the navigation of, but cannot see the physical robot (R). We impose network bandwidth restrictions in two mission scenarios comparable to real circumstances by varying the availability of sensor, image, and video signals to Rn, in effect limiting the human Rn to function as an automation stand-in. To better understand the capabilities and language required in such configurations, we constructed multi-modal corpora of time-synced dialog, video, and LIDAR files recorded during task sessions. We can now examine commander/robot dialogs while replaying what C and Rn saw, to assess their task performance under these varied conditions.</abstract>

The first is “scene to text”: when exploring new locations, how do people talk about what they see, and how does that inform how they want robot team members to communicate about what they “see” while exploring? The second is “text to scene”: given natural language instructions, how do people move about in new locations, and how does that impact their expectations of robot navigation? These issues span both generation and understanding of spatial language. There exists a large literature on spatial language, starting several decades ago (Talmy, 1983; Anderson et al., 1991; Gurney et al., 1996; Bloom et al., 1996; Olivier and Gapp, 1998) inter alia. This work yielded linguistic insights into the underlying structure of spatial expressions, that has led more recently to annotation efforts like SpaceML (Morarescu, 2006) and spatial role labeling (Kordjamshidi et al., 2010).

(2008). Within computational linguistics, Srihari and Burhans (1994) tackled going from text to images, exploiting the conventions and spatial language in news caption to identify people 10 by their relative positions in accompanying images. More recently Coyne et al. (2011) presented work for text-to-graphics generation, grounding conceptual knowledge in relational semantic encoding of lexical meanings from FrameNet. These one-way, directional approaches provide strong evidence that text and image modalities can each inform the processing of the other, and that, with concurrent audio and video streaming data, the alignment of time-stamped files across the two</context>

The first is “scene to text”: when exploring new locations, how do people talk about what they see, and how does that inform how they want robot team members to communicate about what they “see” while exploring? The second is “text to scene”: given natural language instructions, how do people move about in new locations, and how does that impact their expectations of robot navigation? These issues span both generation and understanding of spatial language. There exists a large literature on spatial language, starting several decades ago (Talmy, 1983; Anderson et al., 1991; Gurney et al., 1996; Bloom et al., 1996; Olivier and Gapp, 1998) inter alia. This work yielded linguistic insights into the underlying structure of spatial expressions, that has led more recently to annotation efforts like SpaceML (Morarescu, 2006) and spatial role labeling (Kordjamshidi et al., 2010). These results, theoretical and computational, have been incorporated into NLP research, such as spoken dialog systems (Meena et al., 2014).

Here we ask, how can multimodal data, as collected and processed by robots, and the robots themselves contribute real-time alerts and responses to human commanders over geographically-distributed networks? The first phase of our approach is to introduce a human stand-in who navigates the robot, posing as an intelligent control system. At this stage, following our prior work (Voss et al., 2014), we seek to determine how the commander communicates to accomplish different tasks with the robot, while we limit the information made available in passing from the robot’s sensors and camera to the commander by way of the stand-in. In future phases, we will progressively automate away this actor’s role, replacing the audio that the stand-in hears with what is “understood” by automatic natural language semantic interpretation within a dialog manager, and replacing the joystick that it uses to navigate as the robot This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Li</context>

These one-way, directional approaches provide strong evidence that text and image modalities can each inform the processing of the other, and that, with concurrent audio and video streaming data, the alignment of time-stamped files across the two data modalities should also yield additional benefits in shared structural analyses and disambiguating references.1 3 Approach In previous work, we had teams search a series of buildings, where all information from the Rn to C was strictly limited to text (Voss et al., 2014). While verbal descriptions of scenery were successfully elicited during exploratory missions, the communication was painfully slow and this scenario yielded unrealistic results from our stand-in: we would not expect a robot to generate the complex verbal descriptions we collected. Furthermore we also learned that our equipment could be adjusted for transmission of LIDAR map data and video stream from the robot to Rn and then to C. In this second study, we allowed individual map and image updates to be sent to C, but only on request. This work provides more explicitly shared knowledge between </context>

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999737565217391">
Many languages, including Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA), insert resumptive pro-
nouns in relative clauses, whereas many
others, such as English, do not, using
empty categories instead. This discrep-
ancy is a source of difficulty when trans-
lating between these languages because
there are words in one language that cor-
respond to empty categories in the other,
and these words must either be inserted
or deleted—depending on translation di-
rection. In this paper, we first examine
challenges presented by resumptive pro-
nouns in MSA-English translations and re-
view resumptive pronoun translations gen-
erated by a popular online MSA-English
MT engine. We then present what is, to
the best of our knowledge, the first system
for automatic identification of resumptive
pronouns. The system achieves 91.9 F1
and 77.8 F1 on Arabic Treebank data when
using gold standard parses and automatic
parses, respectively.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.95438125">
One of the challenges for modern machine trans-
lation (MT) is the need to systematically insert
or delete information that is overtly expressed
in only one of the languages in order to main-
tain intelligibility and/or fluency. For example,
word alignment between pro-drop and non-pro-
drop languages can be negatively impacted by the
systematic dropping of pronouns in only one of the
languages (Xiang et al., 2013). A similar type of
linguistic phenomenon of great interest to linguists
that has not yet received significant attention in
MT research is the mismatch between languages
in their usage of resumptive pronouns. Some lan-
guages, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA),
require the insertion of resumptive pronouns in
many relative clauses, whereas other languages,
including English, rarely permit them. An exam-
ple of an MSA sentence is given below, with its
English gloss showing the resumptive pronoun in
bold, its reference translation (RT), and an MT
system output where the roles of patient and doc-
tor are incorrectly reversed:

In this paper, we examine translations pro-
duced by a popular online translation system for
MSA resumptive pronouns occurring in several
different syntactic positions to gain insight into
the types of errors generated by current MT en-
gines. In a test suite of 300 MSA sentences with
resumptive pronouns, over 30% of the relative
clauses with resumptive pronouns were translated
inaccurately. We then present an automatic classi-
fier that we built for identifying MSA resumptive
pronouns and the results obtained from using it in
experiments with the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri
et al., 2004; Maamouri and Bies, 2004). The
system achieves 91.9 F1 and 77.8 F1 on Arabic
Treebank data when using gold standard parses
and automatic parses, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
automatically identify resumptive pronouns in any
language.

antecedent plays the role of the subject, no re-
sumptive pronoun is inserted1; instead, MSA in-
flects the verb to agree with the subject in number
and gender by attaching an affix2. A second sig-
nificant difference between the two languages is
that, in MSA, relative pronouns are required for
relative clauses modifying definite noun phrases
but are prohibited when modifying indefinite noun
phrases; in English, definitiveness neither prevents
nor necessitates the inclusion of a relative pro-
noun. A third significant difference is that, for free
relative clauses—that is, relative clauses that are
not attached to an external antecedent—MSA has
a different set of relative pronouns for introducing
the clause3. A fourth challenge is that MSA has no
equivalent word for the English word ‘whose’ and,
to convey a similar meaning, employs resumptive
pronouns as possessive modifiers. Examples illus-
trating these differences are provided in Table 1.
For further background on MSA relative clauses
and MSA grammar, we refer readers to books by
Ryding (2005) and Badawi et al. (2004).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.802540875">
1A notable exception to this rule is for equational sen-
tences. MSA lacks an overt copula corresponding to the En-
glish word ‘is’ and, to convey a similar meaning, resumptive
subject pronouns must be inserted in these contexts.
2In standard VSO and VOS constructions, the verbs in-
flect as singular regardless of the number of the subject.
3These pronouns are also employed to introduce ques-
tions.

<bodyText confidence="0.999947074074074">
In our research, we rely on the conversion of con-
stituent into dependency structures and the train-
ing/dev/test splits of the Arabic Treebank (ATB)
parts 1, 2, &amp; 3 (Maamouri et al., 2004; Maamouri
and Bies, 2004) as presented by Tratz (2013).
We extract features from labeled dependency trees
(rather than constituent trees) generated by Tratz’s
(2013) Arabic NLP system, which separates cli-
tics, labels parts-of-speech, produces dependency
parses, and identifies and labels affixes.
The original ATB dependency conversion does
not mark pronouns for resumptiveness, so we
modify the conversion process to obtain this infor-
mation. The original ATB constituent trees mark
this by labeling WHNP nodes and NP nodes with
identical indices. If the NP node corresponds to a
null subject and the head of the S under the SBAR
is a verb, we mark the inflectional affix on the
verb, which agrees with the subject in gender and
number, as resumptive. These inflectional affixes
are included as their own category within our anal-
yses since their presence precludes the appearance
of another resumptive pronoun within the relative
clause (e.g., as a direct object).
The total number of resumptive pronouns and
“resumptive” inflectional affixes in the training,
dev, and test sections are presented in Table 2. In

4 Translation Error Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990363636364">
As an exploratory exercise to gain insight into the
types of errors generated by current MT engines
when translating from a language that inserts re-
sumptive pronouns (i.e., MSA) to one that doesn’t
(i.e., English), we worked with a native Arabic
speaker to produce a list of Arabic sentences that
vary in terms of definitiveness (and existence, as
with free relatives) of the external antecedent, and
the syntactic position of the resumptive pronoun,
along with English glosses and reference transla-
tions for these sentences. This set was then pro-
cessed using a popular online translation system,
which we refer to as system X. The sentences,
their glosses, reference translations, and automatic
translations are presented in Table 1.
Although system X did not typically produce
English pronouns corresponding to the resumptive
pronouns in the source, most of the translations
proved problematic, with many of the issues be-
ing related to reordering. Thus, while system X
appears to be good at not translating resumptive
pronouns, its performance on the relative clauses
that contain them has ample room for improve-
ment. Our working hypothesis is that system X’s
English language model is effective in discount-
ing candidate translations that keep the resumptive
pronoun.
As a second exploratory exercise, we automat-
ically extracted all the resumptive pronoun exam-
ples in the training section of the data described
in Section 3 and grouped them based upon the se-
quence of dependency arc labels from the resump-
tive pronoun up to the head of the relative clause

and the first letter of the POS tag of the interven-
ing words (e.g., ‘N’ for noun, ‘A’ for adjective).
For each of the thirty most common configura-
tions, we took ten examples (for a total of 300), ran
them through system X’s Arabic-English model
and gave both the translation and the source text
to our native Arabic expert. Our expert examined
whether 1) the translation engine generated a pro-
noun corresponding to the source side resumptive
pronoun and 2) whether the translation was correct
locally within the relative clause (whether the pro-
noun was retained or not)5. The results for these
two judgments are presented in Table 3.

Table 3: Expert judgments

<bodyText confidence="0.9999295">
Our expert concluded that a corresponding En-
glish pronoun was produced in only 37 of the
300 examples (12.3%). Seventeen of these were
judged correct, although in many of these cases a
significant portion of the relative clause was trans-
lated incorrectly even though a small portion in-
cluding the pronoun was translated properly, mak-
ing judgment difficult. Our expert noted that many
of the correct translations involved switching the
voice of the verb in the relative clause from ac-
tive to passive voice using a past participle. Of
the 189 that had no corresponding pronoun and
were judged correct, 46 (24.3%) involved switch-
ing to passive voice. In general, it appears that
system X does a good job at not generating En-
glish pronouns corresponding to MSA resumptive
pronouns, although it makes numerous mistakes
with the data we presented to it.

Having examined the classification system er-
rors on the development data, we conclude that
the main source of this drop is due to poor iden-
tification and attachment of bare relatives7 by the
Tratz (2013) NLP system. While the NLP system
achieves 88.5 UAS and 86.1 LAS on the develop-
ment section,8 its performance on identifying bare
relatives is comparatively low, with 70.0 precision
and 60.5 recall. For the test section, the NLP sys-
tem performance on bare relatives is even lower at
69.6 precision and 52.7 recall. This helps to ex-
plain why our resumptive pronoun classifier per-
forms worse on the test data than on the devel-
opment data when using automatic pre-processing
but not when using gold standard markup.

The computational linguistics research most rele-
vant to ours is the work on identifying empty cat-
egories for several languages, including English,
Chinese, Korean, and Hindi. Empty categories
are nodes in a parse tree that do not correspond
to any written morpheme; these are used to han-
dle several linguistic phenomena, including pro-
drop. Recent research demonstrates that recovery
of empty categories can lead to improved transla-
tion quality for some language pairs (Chung and
Gildea, 2010; Xiang et al., 2013). For more in-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990481481481">
In this paper, we present the challenge of translat-
ing MSA relative clauses, which often contain re-
sumptive pronouns, into English, which relies on
(inferred) empty categories instead. We examine
errors made by a popular online translation service
on MSA relative clauses and present an automatic
system for identifying MSA resumptive pronouns.
The online translation service occasionally gen-
erates English pronouns corresponding to MSA
resumptive pronouns, producing resumptive pro-
nouns for only 37 of 300 examples that cover a
variety of frequent MSA relative clause structures.
Our MSA resumptive pronoun identification
system achieves high levels of precision (92.1)
and recall (91.7) on resumptive pronoun identifi-
cation when using gold standard markup. Perfor-
mance drops significantly when using automatic
pre-processing, with precision and recall falling to
83.6 and 72.8, respectively. One of the sources
of the drop appears to be the weak performance
of the Tratz (2013) Arabic NLP system in identi-
fying and attaching bare relative clauses—that is,
relative clauses that lack a relative pronoun.
This work is the first attempt we are aware of to
automatically identify resumptive pronouns in any
language, and it presents a baseline for compari-
son for future research efforts.

Going forward, we plan to experiment with apply-
ing our resumptive pronoun identifier to enhance
MT performance, likely by deleting all resumptive
pronouns during alignment and, again, at transla-
tion time. Another natural next step is to train the
system using automatically generated parse, part-
of-speech tag, and clitic segmentation information
instead of gold standard annotation to see if this
produces a similar drop in performance. We also
plan to investigate the use of frame information of
Arabic VerbNet (Mousser, 2010) as features, and
we would like to focus in greater detail on the dif-
ficulties in generating resumptive pronouns when
translating from English into MSA.

<abstract confidence="0.995673333333333">Many languages, including Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), insert resumptive pronouns in relative clauses, whereas many others, such as English, do not, using empty categories instead. This discrepancy is a source of difficulty when translating between these languages because there are words in one language that correspond to empty categories in the other, and these words must either be inserted or deleted—depending on translation direction. In this paper, we first examine challenges presented by resumptive pronouns in MSA-English translations and review resumptive pronoun translations generated by a popular online MSA-English MT engine. We then present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first system for automatic identification of resumptive pronouns. The system achieves 91.9 F1 and 77.8 F1 on Arabic Treebank data when using gold standard parses and automatic parses, respectively.</abstract>

A third significant difference is that, for free relative clauses—that is, relative clauses that are not attached to an external antecedent—MSA has a different set of relative pronouns for introducing the clause3. A fourth challenge is that MSA has no equivalent word for the English word ‘whose’ and, to convey a similar meaning, employs resumptive pronouns as possessive modifiers. Examples illustrating these differences are provided in Table 1. For further background on MSA relative clauses and MSA grammar, we refer readers to books by Ryding (2005) and Badawi et al. (2004). 1A notable exception to this rule is for equational sentences. MSA lacks an overt copula corresponding to the English word ‘is’ and, to convey a similar meaning, resumptive subject pronouns must be inserted in these contexts. 2In standard VSO and VOS constructions, the verbs inflect as singular regardless of the number of the subject. 3These pronouns are also employed to introduce questions. 3 Data In our research, we rely on the conversion of constituent into dependency structures and the training/dev/test splits of the Arabic Treebank (ATB) parts 1, 2, &amp; 3 (Maamouri et al., 2004; Maamouri </context>

Of the 189 that had no corresponding pronoun and were judged correct, 46 (24.3%) involved switching to passive voice. In general, it appears that system X does a good job at not generating English pronouns corresponding to MSA resumptive pronouns, although it makes numerous mistakes with the data we presented to it. 5 System Description Our MSA resumptive pronoun identification system processes one sentence at a time and relies upon the (averaged) structured perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) to rank the feasible actions. When processing a sentence containing n pronouns and affixes, a total of n iterations are performed. During each processing iteration, the system considers two actions for every unlabeled 5This latter task was challenging, but permitted, as intended, lenient judgment of the MT output. 44 Function Definitions: path(x) – returns a list of dependency arcs from x up through the first ‘ripcmp’, ‘rcmod’, or ‘ROOT’ arc (link from affix to the core word is also treated as an arc) rDescendants(x) – returns a list of paths (dependency arc lists) from x to each descendant a</context>

A third significant difference is that, for free relative clauses—that is, relative clauses that are not attached to an external antecedent—MSA has a different set of relative pronouns for introducing the clause3. A fourth challenge is that MSA has no equivalent word for the English word ‘whose’ and, to convey a similar meaning, employs resumptive pronouns as possessive modifiers. Examples illustrating these differences are provided in Table 1. For further background on MSA relative clauses and MSA grammar, we refer readers to books by Ryding (2005) and Badawi et al. (2004). 1A notable exception to this rule is for equational sentences. MSA lacks an overt copula corresponding to the English word ‘is’ and, to convey a similar meaning, resumptive subject pronouns must be inserted in these contexts. 2In standard VSO and VOS constructions, the verbs inflect as singular regardless of the number of the subject. 3These pronouns are also employed to introduce questions. 3 Data In our research, we rely on the conversion of constituent into dependency structures and the training/dev/test splits of the Arabic Treebank (ATB) parts 1, 2, &amp; 3 (Maamour</context>

We extract features from labeled dependency trees (rather than constituent trees) generated by Tratz’s (2013) Arabic NLP system, which separates clitics, labels parts-of-speech, produces dependency parses, and identifies and labels affixes. The original ATB dependency conversion does not mark pronouns for resumptiveness, so we modify the conversion process to obtain this information. The original ATB constituent trees mark this by labeling WHNP nodes and NP nodes with identical indices. If the NP node corresponds to a null subject and the head of the S under the SBAR is a verb, we mark the i</context>

For these cases, the system only considers the prefix as there is no need to make two separate judgments. 6 Experiments We trained our system on the training data using the gold standard clitic segmentation, parse, and part-of-speech information and optimized it for overall F1 (pronouns and inflectional affixes combined) on the development data. Performance peaked on training iteration 8, and we applied the resulting model to two treatments of the test data, once using the gold standard annotation and once using the Tratz (2013) Arabic NLP system to automatically pre-process the data. 6.1 Results and Discussion The scores for the development and test sections, both for gold and automatic annotation, are presented in Table 4. The system performs well when given input with gold standard clitic segmentation, POS tags, and dependency parses, achieving 91.9 F1 for resumptive pronouns on the test set and 95.4 F1 for the affixes. Performance however degrades substantially when automatic pre-processing of the source is input instead.

Having examined the classification system errors on the development data, we conclude that the main source of this drop is due to poor identification and attachment of bare relatives7 by the Tratz (2013) NLP system. While the NLP system achieves 88.5 UAS and 86.1 LAS on the development section,8 its performance on identifying bare relatives is comparatively low, with 70.0 precision and 60.5 recall. For the test section, the NLP system performance on bare relatives is even lower at 69.6 precision and 52.7 recall. This helps to explain why our resumptive pronoun classifier performs worse on the test data than on the development data when using automatic pre-processing but not when using gold standard markup. 7 Related Work The computational linguistics research most relevant to ours is the work</context>

Our MSA resumptive pronoun identification system achieves high levels of precision (92.1) and recall (91.7) on resumptive pronoun identification when using gold standard markup. Performance drops significantly when using automatic pre-processing, with precision and recall falling to 83.6 and 72.8, respectively. One of the sources of the drop appears to be the weak performance of the Tratz (2013) Arabic NLP system in identifying and attaching bare relative clauses—that is, relative clauses that lack a relative pronoun. This work is the first attempt we are aware of to automatically identify resumptive pronouns in any language, and it presents a baseline for comparison for future research efforts. 9 Future Work Going forward, we plan to experiment with applying our resumptive pronoun identifier to enhance MT performance, likely by deleting all resumptive pronouns during alignment and, again, at translation time.

The system achieves 91.9 F1 and 77.8 F1 on Arabic Treebank data when using gold standard parses and automatic parses, respectively. 1 Introduction One of the challenges for modern machine translation (MT) is the need to systematically insert or delete information that is overtly expressed in only one of the languages in order to maintain intelligibility and/or fluency. For example, word alignment between pro-drop and non-prodrop languages can be negatively impacted by the systematic dropping of pronouns in only one of the languages (Xiang et al., 2013). A similar type of linguistic phenomenon of great interest to linguists that has not yet received significant attention in MT research is the mismatch between languages in their usage of resumptive pronouns. Some languages, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), require the insertion of resumptive pronouns in many relative clauses, whereas other languages, including English, rarely permit them. An example of an MSA sentence is given below, with its English gloss showing the resumptive pronoun in bold, its reference translation (RT), and an MT system output where the roles of patient and doctor</context>

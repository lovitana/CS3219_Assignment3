Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998827266666667">
WordNet is an electronic lexical database
available on-line as a powerful resource to
the researchers in the area of computational
linguistics, text processing and other related
areas. WordNet for Hindi language has al-
ready been developed by IIT, Bombay. The
Indian languages WordNets are being created
using expansion approach from Hindi Word-
Net under IndoWordNet project. In expan-
sion approach, semantic relations are bor-
rowed from the reference language, while the
lexical relations need to be created for each
language, as these relations are language de-
pendent. This paper describes the process of
creation of lexical relations like antonym,
compounding, conjunction and gradation for
IndoWordNet. A lexical creation tool has
been presented in this paper with provision to
create lexical relations in target language on
the basis of relations created in Hindi Word-
Net and with another provision to create lexi-
cal relations in target language without refer-
ring to Hindi WordNet. It has been observed
that lexical relations for target language can
be created easily on the basis of relations cre-
ated in Hindi WordNet for Hindi in-family
languages, while for the languages that do not
fall in the same family provision of creation
of lexical relation without referring to Hindi
WordNet can be used.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943651162791">
WordNet is a large lexical database of a lan-
guage. In WordNet, words are grouped together
according to their similarity of meanings. Word-
Net maintains concepts in a language, relations
between concepts and their ontological details.
Each concept in a language represents a synset.
Synsets are basic building blocks of WordNet.
Synset is composed of gloss, example sentences
and set of synonym words that are used for the
concept. Besides synset data, a WordNet main-
tains lexical and semantic relations. Lexical rela-
tions like antonomy and gradation are between
the words in a language whereas semantic rela-
tions like hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy,
holonymy, entailment, troponymy and casuation
are between concepts in a language. WordNet
structure makes it a useful tool for computational
linguistics and natural language processing. The
major applications of WordNet are text categori-
zation (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2004), text
summarization (Bellare et al., 2004), word sense
disambiguation (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002)
and machine translation etc.
Recognizing the immense importance of lexi-
cal resources arises the necessity for creation of
IndoWordNet project. IndoWordNet is a linked
structure of WordNets of major Indian languages
from Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Sino-Tibetan
families. The WordNets for these languages are
being created using the expansion approach from
the Hindi WordNet which was made available
free for research in 2006. Using expansion ap-
proach, there is advantage of being able to bor-
row the semantic relations of a given source
WordNet (Bhattacharyya, 2010). Lexical rela-
tions cannot be borrowed from source WordNet
using expansion approach as they are language
dependent. In order to create lexical relations for
IndoWordNet languages, a lexical creation tool
has been proposed in this paper with a provision
to create lexical relations from source WordNet
and as well as to create lexical relations for those
words which are not covered in source WordNet.

English WordNet is the first WordNet created in
this field. The development of English WordNet
started in 1985 (Miller, 1985) at the Cognitive
Science Laboratory of Princeton University. The
success of English WordNet has inspired several
projects that aim at constructing the WordNet for
other languages or to develop multilingual
WordNet. EuroWordNet is a system of semantic
network for European languages. The Eu-
roWordNet project dealt with Dutch, Italian,
Spanish, German, French, Czech, and Estonian
languages (Vossen, 1998). BalkaNet WordNet
project has developed WordNets for Bulgarian,
Greek, Romanian, Serbian and Turkish lan-
guages (Tufis et al., 2004).
In India, Hindi WordNet was developed in
2006 by IIT, Bombay. Later on Hindi WordNet
was extended to Marathi WordNet. Currently
IndoWordNet project, a linked structure of major
Indian languages is in progress in India. Moreo-
ver, Indradhunsh Project a part of IndoWordNet
project, aim at developing WordNets for seven
major Indian languages, Bengali, Gujarati,
Kashmiri, Konkani, Oriya, Punjabi and Urdu has
been initiated in 2010. These Indian languages
WordNets are being created using expansion ap-
proach from Hindi WordNet under the guidance
of IIT, Bombay.

3 WordIet relations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968777777778">
WordNet contains the standard information
found in dictionaries and thesauri. An additional
feature of WordNet is its information about the
relationships between words and synsets. The
words and synsets in the WordNet are linked
through two types of relations, i.e., lexical and
semantic relations. Lexical relation exists be-
tween the word forms while semantic relation
exists between the concepts.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999371">
3.1 Semantic relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.957208757575758">
Semantic relation is a relation between mean-
ings, and since meanings can be represented by
synsets, semantic relations can be considered as
pointers between synsets (Tufis et al., 2004). For
example, hypernym/hyponym is a semantic rela-
tion. Consider two synsets given in (1) and (2).
{ਪੌਦਾ paudd ’plant’, ਬੂਟਾ būṭd ‘plant’} ...(1)
{ਚਾਹ cdh ‘tea’} ...(2)
Here, {ਪੌਦਾ paudd ’plant’, ਬੂਟਾ būṭd ’plant’} is
hypernym of {ਚਾਹ cdh ‘tea’} and {ਚਾਹ cdh ‘tea’}
is hyponym of {ਪੌਦਾ paudd ’plant’, ਬੂਟਾ būṭd
’plant’}. There are total thirteen semantic rela-
tions, namely, hypernymy, hyponymy, mer-
onymy, holonymy, entailment, causation, tro-
ponymy, ability link, capability link, functional
link, attributes, modifies noun and modifies verb
exist in a WordNet.
Using expansion approach there is advantage
of being able to borrow the semantic relations of
a given WordNet. For example, consider two
synsets in the source WordNet given in (3) and
(4).
{चाय chaie ‘tea’} ...(3)
{पौधा paudha ‘plant’, पौदा pauda ‘plant’} ...(4)
In Hindi WordNet (source), synset given by
(4) is hypernymy of synset given by (3) and syn-
set given by (3) is hyponym of synset given by
(4). These two synsets also share hyperony-
my/hyponymy relation in Punjabi (target) lan-
guage. Since, the synset-id are kept same for all
the languages, therefore, semantic relations from
the source WordNet (Hindi) can be extended to
all target languages with expansion approach.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998027">
3.2 Lexical Relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999892666666667">
Lexical relations are the relations between mem-
bers of two different synsets. For example, con-
sider two synsets given in (5) and (6).
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.877347">
{ਮੋਟਾ mōṭd ‘fat’, ਭਾਰੀ bhdrī ‘fat’, ਸਥੂਲ sathūl ’fat’,
ਥੂਲ thūl ‘fat’,ਵਜਨੀ vajnī ‘fat’} ...(5)
{ਪਤਲਾ patld ‘thin’, ਦੁਬਲਾ dubld ‘thin’, ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰ
kamzōr ‘thin’, ਮਾੜਾ mdṛd ‘thin’} ...(6)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997056">
Here, synsets (5) and (6) are opposites but
they do not share antonym relation. Antonym
relation exists between two words not between
two synsets. Here, words ਮੋਟਾ mōṭd ’fat’ and
ਪਤਲਾ patld ‘thin’ are in antonym relation.

Antonymy is a lexical relation that exists be-

meaning. The antonyms for Hindi WordNet have
already been created. Antonyms for the Punjabi
WordNet can be created from the antonyms of
Hindi WordNet, but database design of Punjabi
WordNet is different from Hindi WordNet.
There is a need to design an interface which can
bridge the gap between two different database
designs and create the antonyms for the Punjabi
WordNet from Hindi WordNet. Algortihm 4.1
has been used for creation of antonyms from
Hindi WordNet. The algorithm is developed us-

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881230769231">
Using expansion approach semantic relations are
borrowed from the source language as they are
same for all the languages. Lexical relations are
language specific, so they cannot be borrowed
from the source language. It has been observed
that manual typing work can be reduced for Hin-
di in-family languages to a larger extent by creat-
ing lexical relations for target language on the
basis of relations created in Hindi WordNet,
while for languages that do not fall in the same
family provision of creation of lexical relation
without referring to Hindi WordNet will be help-
ful extensively.

Lexical relations like antonomy and gradation are between the words in a language whereas semantic relations like hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy, holonymy, entailment, troponymy and casuation are between concepts in a language. WordNet structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing. The major applications of WordNet are text categorization (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2004), text summarization (Bellare et al., 2004), word sense disambiguation (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002) and machine translation etc. Recognizing the immense importance of lexical resources arises the necessity for creation of IndoWordNet project. IndoWordNet is a linked structure of WordNets of major Indian languages from Indo-Aryan, Dravidian and Sino-Tibetan families. The WordNets for these languages are being created using the expansion approach from the Hindi WordNet which was made available free for research in 2006.

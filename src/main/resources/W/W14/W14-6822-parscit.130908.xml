The importance of learning Chinese is
increasing in the latest decades. However, the
learning of Chinese is not easy for foreigners as
a second language learning. Sometimes they
write some text or document, but there always
have many error words. So, how to detect the
error word in document is becoming more then
more important. This issue is very extensive, not
only can help foreigners to learning Chinese but
also can detect the error word. This paper had
proposed method can divide five sections of
structure: First sections are input sentence;
second sections are parsing and word
segmentation; third sections are fine the wrong
word; forth sections are remove duplicate; fifth
sections are final output. In this paper we use
language model to detect Chinese spelling. It is
had four part, E-Hownet, CKIP, similar
pronunciation and shape dictionary, use the
preset word to compare the word correction
which in database. We use the bi-gram to
promote our performance.

<bodyText confidence="0.999960142857143">
Learning Chinese is very important in this era,
because the Chinese is main market customers.
Since the trend of the times, there have many of
foreigners beginning to learn Chinese. But
Chinese is not easy to learn, because sometime
the same word has many pronouns, or same
pronounce has different word, even the much the
words have similar glyph. Chinese unlike
English, there have thousands of words in
Chinese, different combinations have different
meaning. Although pronounce the same, but
there will be different words with different
meaning, sometimes there were having some
misunderstanding because using the wrong word.
So how to learn Chinese is very import research.
This topic is extensive, not only for foreigners to
learn Chinese, but also can help to detect the
wrong word in the document.
In recent years, there has a lot of paper to
research about Chinese learning. Chinese
learning in today not only face to face teaching,
but also can learn in a mobile system. There
have many type smartphone applications about
learning Chinese, sometimes there also has
another country&apos;s language. Michael B. Syson et
al. (2012) propose a system ABKD which is
learning the game in multimodal, this system has
two languages for learning, one is Chinese the
other is Japanese. This system is learning about
the Chinese Hanzi and Japanese Kanji by the
game. Vincent Tam et al. (2012) use iOS-Base
devices to propose an e-learning software, this
device is extendible and ubiquitous, this paper
proposes different learning type like it can learn
the characters in correct stroke sequences of
Chinese, it also has some mini-game to help
learning Chinese. This author also proposes
another paper is main on writing Chinese, and
not only focus on iOS-base, but also for other
smart phone (ex: android). Xiangyu Qiu et al.
(2012) propose a method about learning Chinese
font style and transferring, it&apos;s based on strokes
and structure, they propose a new glyph
decryption method, it divides the Chinese
characters two parts, one is the stable side call
structure, the other side is mutable called style.
Mei-Jen Audrey Shih et al. (2011) propose an
online system to learn Chinese, online learning
system is convenience for user, it is assembled
to abound environment and had a broad content
search opportunity, this paper is focused on how
to learn Chinese language effectively in an
online learning environment. Lee Jo Kim et al.
(2011) propose a tool which supports Chinese
language teaching and learning system based on
ICT-Base, this tool can help peer assisted

learning environment. Lung-Hsiang et al. (2012)
propose a mobile assisted system about learning
vocabulary, they use the Mobile-Assisted
language learning (MALL), they present two
case studies in the Mobile-Assisted Language
Learning, this system is main on two languages,
one is English, the other is Chinese, specially it
is not learning the word, it is learning about the
“idioms” and learning how to construct
sentences. Shang-Jen Chuanget al. (2011)
propose a new recognition of Traditional
Chinese handwriting by neural networks, their
recognition of Traditional Chinese handwriting
by PNN and SVM, their database is 20 people’s
Traditional Chinese handwriting, and use
different quantization methods for everyone.
Yingfei Wu (2011) proposes a learning system
of “Chinese calligraphy” on mobile systems,
Calligraphy is good for learning Traditional
Chinese font, because it needs step by step to
write the Chinese word, but calligraphy is not
easy, even a word usually has many different
font styles, the calligraphy need ink and paper,
so they propose a new mobile system which can
easy to learning Calligraphy without use paper
and ink. David Tawei Ku et al. (2012) proposes
the Chinese learning in situated learning, it is
trend a ubiquitous learning environment, and the
feature focuses on real life learning situation,
and problem solving practice, this learning
system divides two parts, one is integrating
situated learning strategy and the other is context
awareness technology. Yanwei Wang et al. (2011)
proposes a discriminative learning method of
MQDF (Modified quadratic discriminant
function), MQDF is based on sample importance
weights, this method is investigated and
compared other discriminative learning methods
about MQDF. DA-Han Wang (2012) propose a
handwriting recognition system, this system
commonly combines character classification
confidence scores, they propose two regularized
classes-dependent confidence transformation
(CT) methods. Yunxue Shao (2011) propose a
similar handwritten Chinese characters method
base on multiple instance learning, they solved
the problem by Asaboost framework, the method
is found week classifiers to select some
self-adapting critical regions. Lung-Hsiang
Wong (2010) propose a Mobile-Assisted
language learning (MALL), their have two case
studies, and focus on &amp;quot;creative learner outputs&amp;quot;,
student in two studies language by one-to-one
mobile devices, and capture the picture of the
real life.Shih-hung Wu et al. (2013) propose a
paper for Chinese Spelling Check task which at
SIGHAN bake-off 2013, in this paper, thay
describe all detail of the task for Chinese
spelling check, include the task descripition,
data preparation, performance metrics, and
evaluation results.
This paper proposes five steps to find the
wrong words in a document: First is input the
sentence; the second uses the CKIP to word
segment; the third is finding the wrong word. In
the third step, the main method in this paper
divides the words in document for three parts,
The first is the single word, sometimes the single
words mean there does not have any match word
before or after this single word, in other words,
is there maybe had word error, so we compose
the word which before or after this single word,
this word most be the single word too. After
composing two of single words, it can generate a
new word than regarded as a suspicious error
word. The second is about idioms, most of the
idioms are composed of four words, so we take
the four words to pronounce and glyph to
compare with the E-Hownet. The other words
(ex: two words, three words), we also compare
with the E-Hownet, if it can find the same word
in E-Hownet, it means this word is correct, use it
as a suspicious error word. Forth is remove
duplicate, this step is remove the duplicate
wrong word. Finally opput the file.

2 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991083333333">
In this section, our proposed method is to check
out the foreigners will get the word wrong and
then correct for the right word. The sentences
written by people learning Chinese as a foreign
language (CFL) may contain a variety of
grammatical errors, such as word choice,
missing words, and so on. It focuses on spelling
errors in this bake-off. We will introduce the
framework of the proposed system and method,
which is divided into two parts: training phase
and test phase that will describe in section 2.1
and section 2.2.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997888">
2.1 Training phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944714285714">
As shown in figure 1, training phase is to
construct the dictionary which is used in test
phase, there are including the similar
pronunciation &amp; shape dictionary and training
data dictionary. E-Hownet is used to find the
wrong word and correct the wrong word, it also
can use to construct the rule induction. And

n-gram models is also used to be the ranking
score construct the rule induction. Finally, the
candidate outputs are generated according to our
rule induction. We will describe more detail in
the follows.
First, we go to pre-process the data from the
bake-off organizer. Step 1, we removed
unnecessary portions of each sentence in the
input file, such as PID number. The results will
feed into the tool which is the CKIP Autotag,
then it will do word segmentation and
part-of-speech tagging based on E-Hownet.
The corresponding part-of-speech (POS) of each
word is obtained in the sentences. Each word has
a part of speech at the end of a word in
parentheses. Step 2, we are going to remove
unessential blank spaces and parentheses. This
step allows us to be more convenient for the
implementation of our program. These processes
are also used in the test phase.
Next, we introduce our rule induction in the
following.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998111">
• Let A𝑖 (𝑖 = 1^-𝑛) mean incorrect word,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.702174666666667">
AQ𝑘(𝑘 = 1^-𝑚, 𝑚 ≤ 4) mean k-th
incorrect word, 𝑆𝑖𝑚(AQ𝑘) mean the
similar word with AQ𝑘.

<listItem confidence="0.958724285714286">
• Let E − HN(AQ1, AQ2, ...... AQ𝑚) mean
that AQ1 to AQ𝑚 can combine into a
word which can be find in E-Hownet,
LOC(B𝑖) mean location of the word.
• 𝑎𝑗 = 𝐿𝑂𝐶 (𝐸 − 𝐻𝑁 (AQ𝑝, 𝑆𝑖𝑚(AQ𝑞))) ,
b,. = 𝐿𝑂𝐶(𝐸 − 𝐻𝑁
(𝑆𝑖𝑚(AQ𝑝), 𝑆𝑖𝑚(AQ𝑞)) ),

<bodyText confidence="0.650400083333333">
when 𝑝 = 1, q = 2^-m or 𝑞 = 1, p =
2^-m . 𝑎𝑗 (j = 1^-m) mean that
AQ𝑝, 𝑆𝑖𝑚(AQ𝑞) combine into a word
which can find in E-Hownet, b,. (r =
1^-𝑛) mean that Sim(AQ𝑝),𝑆𝑖𝑚(AQ𝑞)
combine into a word which can find in
E-Hownet.
• M𝑖𝑛((𝑎1, 𝑎2,... , 𝑎𝑚), (b1, b2,..., b𝑛)
mean that output the minimum, this
indicates the position of the front in the
E-Hownet which is the more correct
word.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999721">
2.2 Test phase
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999740375">
In the previous section, the rule induction is built
in training phase. We will describe the test phase
of the framework in this section. The word
segmentation and part of speech (POS) labeling
are the same as training phase. Then, we begin
the processes with the third step, we have to
detect the wrong word. There are some proposed
method to find the wrong word in the following.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.949203210526316">
• In the previous step, we have the word
segmentation, we choose the words more
than two characters, then compared the
words with E-Hownet or training data
dictionary. If there is not the same words
in E-Hownet or training data dictionary,
we determine it as incorrect words.
• For the judge idioms, we choose all word
with four characters, and compared the
word with E-Hownet and the similar
pronunciation &amp; shape dictionary. If there
is not the same words in the training data
dictionary, E-Hownet or similar
pronunciation &amp; shape dictionary, we
determine it as incorrect words.
• To the judge the sentences written by CFL,
we focus on “的 (De)”, “地 (De)”, “得
(De)”. Behind the “ 的 (De)” must
connect the verb, behind the “地 (De)”
</listItem>
<page confidence="0.995111">
141
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999701866666667">
must be a noun. Further, behind the “得
(De)” must be a verb, fornt the “得 (De)”
can be an adverb, Nv or Nh. If the
characters do not comply with the POS of
the above, we determine it as incorrect
words.
 Finally, we strengthen the judgment of
single character. Behind or found the
single character is the same as single
characters, we combine the character to
the word which contain two characters.
And we determine it as incorrect words.
According the above, we begin the processes
which is comparing the wrong words with
similar pronunciation &amp; shape dictionary, that is
in order to find the similar words, then if the
similar words can be found in E-Hownet or
training data dictionary, we saved the incorrect
words in a text file named wrong, and saved the
similar words in a text file named correct, this
focuses on two characters of the word in the case
of one character wrong. The proposed method
also aim the two characters of the word in the
case of all characters wrong, eg., 勞刀 (嘮叨).
The processes as is same as above, but the
incorrect words saved in a text file named
double_wrong, and the similar saved in a text
file named double_correct. The fifth step, we are
going to remove duplicates. First, If the words in
the text named wrong can be found in the text
named double_wrong, we will remove the words
in wrong. Second, if identify the words appear
more than twice, we will remove the
unnecessary words. It is helping us to reduce the
process time. We will output the result in the
final step. The processes will find the words and
find the corresponding sentence, then save the
position and correct word in the file named
output. Finally, according the PID to sort the
sentence and output to the specified format. For
example, input: “(pid= A2-1051-1) 後天是小明
的 生 日 , 我 要 開 一 個 無 會 。 ”, output:
“A2-1051-1, 15, 舞”, If the input contains no
spelling errors, the system should return “pid,
0”.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993130434783">
This study proposes a method for Chinese text
detect spelling error. The method in our study is
focus on word classify to easy detect Chinese
spelling error. The word is classifying three
class, single word, idioms and other words (two
words, three words et.)The experimental result
shows the performance it good, and we also
apply this method in “SIGHAN 8 Chinese
spelling check task”, and the final result pretty
good. In the feature, we hope can raise the
performance and find the other word classifies.
More word class can helpful to find the Chinese
spelling error. After the Chinese spelling error,
we will start to study the relationship between
grammar and spelling errors, because in this
paper we only care about the word pronouns and
glyph, but in recent years some spelling error
has been regularization, it most to understanding
the context then detect it is right or wrong, so the
issue about the relationship between grammar
and spelling errors is need to study, if we can
fine the relationship then the Chinese spelling
detect correct rate must can raise higher.

<abstract confidence="0.999168260869565">The importance of learning Chinese is increasing in the latest decades. However, the learning of Chinese is not easy for foreigners as a second language learning. Sometimes they write some text or document, but there always have many error words. So, how to detect the error word in document is becoming more then more important. This issue is very extensive, not only can help foreigners to learning Chinese but also can detect the error word. This paper had proposed method can divide five sections of structure: First sections are input sentence; second sections are parsing and word segmentation; third sections are fine the wrong word; forth sections are remove duplicate; fifth sections are final output. In this paper we use language model to detect Chinese spelling. It is had four part, E-Hownet, CKIP, similar pronunciation and shape dictionary, use the preset word to compare the word correction which in database. We use the bi-gram to promote our performance.</abstract>

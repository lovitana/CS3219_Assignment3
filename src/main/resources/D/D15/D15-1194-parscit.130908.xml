<bodyText confidence="0.999988833333333">
Previous studies have shown that health
reports in social media, such as Dai-
lyStrength and Twitter, have potential for
monitoring health conditions (e.g. adverse
drug reactions, infectious diseases) in par-
ticular communities. However, in order
for a machine to understand and make in-
ferences on these health conditions, the
ability to recognise when laymen’s terms
refer to a particular medical concept (i.e.
text normalisation) is required. To achieve
this, we propose to adapt an existing
phrase-based machine translation (MT)
technique and a vector representation of
words to map between a social media
phrase and a medical concept. We eval-
uate our proposed approach using a col-
lection of phrases from tweets related to
adverse drug reactions. Our experimen-
tal results show that the combination of a
phrase-based MT technique and the simi-
larity between word vector representations
outperforms the baselines that apply only
either of them by up to 55%.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99988475">
Social media, such as DailyStrength1 and Twit-
ter2, is a fast growing and potentially rich source
of voice of the patient data about experience in
terms of benefits and side-effects of drugs and
treatments (O’Connor et al., 2014). However,
natural language understanding from social me-
dia messages is a difficult task because of the
lexical and grammatical variability of the lan-
guage (Baldwin et al., 2013; O’Connor et al.,
2014). Indeed, language understanding by ma-
chines requires the ability to recognise when a
phrase refers to a particular concept. Given a

<bodyText confidence="0.999608275">
variable length phrase, an effective system should
return a concept with the most similar mean-
ing. Table 1 shows examples of mappings be-
tween Twitter phrases and medical concepts. For
example, a Twitter phrase ‘No way I’m gettin
any sleep 2nite’ might be mapped to the med-
ical concept ‘Insomnia’ (SNOMED:193462001),
when using the SNOMED-CT ontology (Spack-
man et al., 1997). The success of the mapping
between social media phrases and formal medi-
cal concepts would enable an automatic integra-
tion between patient experiences and biomedical
databases (Limsopatham and Collier, 2015). We
refer to this mapping from social media phrases to
medical concepts as medical term normalisation,
which aims to determine the unique identifier of
a medical concept that is mentioned in different
forms in a free-text (Morgan et al., 2008).
Existing works, e.g. (Elkin et al., 2012; Gob-
bel et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2009), mostly fo-
cused on identifying medical concepts in medi-
cal documents. For example, Gobbel et al. (2014)
proposed a naive Bayesian-based technique to
map phrases from clinical notes to medical con-
cepts in the SNOMED-CT ontology. Wang et
al. (2009) identified medical concepts regarding
adverse drug events in electronic medical records.
On the other hand, O’Connor et al. (2014) in-
vestigated the normalisation of medical terms in
Twitter messages. In particular, they proposed to
use the Lucene retrieval engine3 to retrieve medi-
cal concepts that could be potentially mapped to
a given Twitter phrase, when mapping between
Twitter phrases and medical concepts.
In contrast, we argue that the medical text nor-
malisation task can be achieved by using well-
established phrase-based MT techniques, where
we translate a text written in a social media lan-
guage (e.g. ‘No way I’m gettin any sleep 2nite’) to
a text written in a formal medical language (e.g.

tween the translated phrase and the description of
a medical concept. Indeed, in this work we investi-
gate an effective adaptation of phrase-based MT to
map a Twitter phrase to a medical concept. More-
over, we propose to combine the adapted phrase-
based MT technique and the similarity between
word vector representations to effectively map a
Twitter phrase to a medical concept.
The main contributions of this paper are three-

Phrase-based MT models, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003;
Och and Ney, 2004), have been shown to be effec-
tive in translation between languages, as they learn
local term dependencies, such as collocations, re-
orderings, insertions and deletions. Koehn et
al. (2003) showed that a phrase-based MT tech-
nique markedly outperformed traditional word-
based MT techniques on several benchmarks. In
this work, we adapt the phrase-based MT tech-
nique of Koehn et al. (2003) for the medical
text normalisation task. In particular, we use the
phrase-based MT technique to translate phrases
from Twitter language to formal medical lan-
guage, before mapping the translated phrases to
medical concepts based on the ranked similarity
of their word vector representations.
Traditional approaches for creating word vec-
tor representations treated words as atomic
units (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Turian et al., 2010).
For instance, the one-hot representation used a
vector with a length of the size of the vocabu-
lary, where one dimension is on, to represent a
particular word (Turian et al., 2010). Recently,
techniques for learning high-quality word vec-
tor representations (i.e. distributed word repre-
sentations) that could capture the semantic sim-
ilarity between words, such as continuous bags
of words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013b) and
global vectors (GloVe) (Pennington et al., 2014),
have been proposed. Indeed, these distributed
word representations have been effectively ap-
plied in different systems that achieve state-of-
the-art performances for several NLP tasks, such
as MT (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and named entity
recognition (Passos et al., 2014). In this work, be-
side using word vector representations to measure
the similarity between translated Twitter phrases
and the description of medical concepts, we use
the similarity between word vector representations
of the original Twitter phrase and the descrip-
tion of a medical concept to augment the adapted
phrase-based MT technique.

3.1 Adapting Phrase-based MT
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999829714285714">
We aim to learn a translation between a Twitter
phrase (i.e. a phrase from a Twitter message) and
a formal medical phrase (i.e. the description of a
medical concept). For a given Twitter phrase phrt,
we find a suitable medical phrase phrm using a
translation score, based on a phrase-based model,
as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.999539">
scoretranslation(phrm|phrt) = p(phrm|phrt) (1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976071428572">
where p(phrm|phrt) can be calculated using any
phrase-based MT technique, e.g. (Koehn et al.,
2003; Och and Ney, 2004). We then rank trans-
lated phrases phrm based on this translation score.
The top-k translated phrases are used for identify-
ing the corresponding medical concept.
However, the translated phrase phrm may not
be exactly matched with the description of any
target medical concepts. We propose two tech-
niques to deal with this problem. For the first
technique, we rank the target concepts based on
the cosine similarity between the vector represen-
tation of phrm and the vector representation of the
description of each concept descc:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9414635">
Vphrm · Vdescc
simcos(phrm, descc) = ||Vphrm ||× ||Vdescc ||(2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998842">
where Vphrm and Vdescc are the vector represen-
tations of phrm and descc, respectively. Any
technique for creating word vector representations
(e.g. one-hot, CBOW and GloVe) can be used.
Note that if a phrase (e.g. phrm) contains several
terms, we create a vector representation by sum-
ming the value of the same dimension of the vec-
tor representation of each word (i.e. element-wise
addition).
On the other hand, the second technique also
incorporates the ranked position r of the trans-
lated phrase phrm when translated from the orig-
inal phrase phrt using Equation (1). Indeed, the
second technique calculates the similarity score as
follows:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.764319666666667">

As discussed in Section 2, word vector represen-

Hence, we propose to map a Twitter phrase phrt
to a medical concept c, which is represented with
a description descc, by linearly combining the co-
sine similarity, between vector representations of
the Twitter phrase phrt and the description descc,
with the similarity score computed using one of
the adapted phrased-based MT techniques (intro-
duced in Section 3.1), as follows:

To evaluate our approach, we use a collection of
25 million tweets related to adverse drug reac-
tions (ADRs), from cognitive enhancers (Hanson
et al., 2013) and anti-depressants (Schneeweiss et
al., 2010). These tweets were collected using the
Twitter Streaming API5 by filtering on the name
of a particular set of drugs that can have adverse
reactions to the patients. Note that terms regard-
ing adverse drug reaction (e.g. insomnia) were
not used for capturing tweets. From this collec-
tion, we use 201 ADR phrases and their corre-
sponding SNOMED-CT concepts annotated by a
PhD-level computational linguist. These phrases
were anonymised by replacing numbers, user IDs,
URIs, locations, email addresses, dates and drug
names with appropriate tokens e.g. NUMBER .

based on the the reciprocal of the rank at which

We use three different techniques, including one-

representations used in our approach (see Sec-

the one-hot representation includes all terms in the
Twitter phrases and the descriptions of the target
SNOMED-CT concepts. Meanwhile, we create
word vector representations based on CBOW and
GloVe by using the word2vec6 and GloVe7 imple-
mentations. We learn the vector representations
from the collections of tweets and medical arti-
cles, respectively, using window size of 10 words.
The tweet collection (denoted Twitter) contains
419,702,147 English tweets, which are related to
11 drug names and 6 cities, while the medical ar-
ticle collection (denoted BMC) includes all med-
ical articles from the BioMed Central8. For both
CBOW and GloVe, we create vector representa-

Another baseline is vSim, where we consider only
the cosine similarity between the vector represen-
tations of the Twitter phrase phrt and the descrip-
tion desc, of target medical concepts.
Table 2 compares the performance of these 6
instantiations and the vSim baseline in terms of
MRR-5. We firstly observe that for the vSim base-
line, excepting for word vector representation with
vector size 50 learned using GloVe from the Twit-
ter collection, word vector representations learned
using either CBOW or GloVe are more effective
than the one-hot representation. However, the dif-
ference between the MRR-5 performance is not
statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05, paired t-test). In
addition, word vector representations learned ei-
ther using CBOW or GloVe with vector size 200
is more effective than those with vector size 50.
Next, we find that our adaptation of phrase-
based MT (i.e. bestMT, topSMT and topSMTr) sig-
nificantly (p &lt; 0.05) outperforms the vSim base-
line. For example, with the one-hot representation,
topSMT (MRR-5 0.2491) and topSMTr (MRR-5
0.2458) perform significantly (p &lt; 0.05) better
than vSim (MRR-5 0.1675) by up to 49%. Mean-
while, when using word vector representations
with the vector size 200 learned using GloVe from
the BMC collection, topSMT (MRR-5 0.2638) sig-
nificantly (p &lt; 0.05) outperforms vSim with either
the GloVe vector representation (MRR-5 0.1869)

We have introduced our approach that adapts a

<abstract confidence="0.99767472">Previous studies have shown that health reports in social media, such as DailyStrength and Twitter, have potential for monitoring health conditions (e.g. adverse drug reactions, infectious diseases) in particular communities. However, in order for a machine to understand and make inferences on these health conditions, the ability to recognise when laymen’s terms refer to a particular medical concept (i.e. text normalisation) is required. To achieve this, we propose to adapt an existing phrase-based machine translation (MT) technique and a vector representation of words to map between a social media phrase and a medical concept. We evaluate our proposed approach using a collection of phrases from tweets related to adverse drug reactions. Our experimental results show that the combination of a phrase-based MT technique and the similarity between word vector representations outperforms the baselines that apply only either of them by up to 55%.</abstract>

However, natural language understanding from social media messages is a difficult task because of the lexical and grammatical variability of the language (Baldwin et al., 2013; O’Connor et al., 2014). Indeed, language understanding by machines requires the ability to recognise when a phrase refers to a particular concept. Given a 1http://www.dailystrength.org/ 2http://twitter.com variable length phrase, an effective system should return a concept with the most similar meaning. Table 1 shows examples of mappings between Twitter phrases and medical concepts. For example, a Twitter phrase ‘No way I’m gettin any sleep 2nite’ might be mapped to the medical concept ‘Insomnia’ (SNOMED:193462001), when using the SNOMED-CT ontology (Spackman et al., 1997).

We address this task as a ranking task, where we aim to rank the medical concept with the highest similarity score, e.g. calculated using Equation (2), at the top rank.

The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1. We investigate the adaptation of phrase-based MT to map a Twitter phrase to a SNOMEDCT concept. 2. We propose to combine our adaptation of phrase-based MT and the similarity between word vector representations to map Twitter phrases to formal medical concepts. 3. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach using phrases from our collection of tweets related to the topic of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 2 Related Work Phrase-based MT models, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), have been shown to be effective in translation between languages, as they learn local term dependencies, such as collocations, reorderings, insertions and deletions. Koehn et al. (2003) showed that a phrase-based MT technique markedly outperformed traditional wordbased MT techniques on several benchmarks. In this work, we adapt the phrase-based MT technique of Koehn et al. (2003) for the medical text normalisation task.

For a given Twitter phrase phrt, we find a suitable medical phrase phrm using a translation score, based on a phrase-based model, as follows: scoretranslation(phrm|phrt) = p(phrm|phrt) (1) where p(phrm|phrt) can be calculated using any phrase-based MT technique, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). We then rank translated phrases phrm based on this translation score. The top-k translated phrases are used for identifying the corresponding medical concept. However, the translated phrase phrm may not be exactly matched with the description of any target medical concepts. We propose two techniques to deal with this problem. For the first technique, we rank the target concepts based on the cosine similarity between the vector representation of phrm and the vector representation of the description of each concept descc: Vphrm · Vdescc simcos(phrm, descc) = ||Vphrm ||× ||V</context>

For instance, the one-hot representation used a vector with a length of the size of the vocabulary, where one dimension is on, to represent a particular word (Turian et al., 2010). Recently, techniques for learning high-quality word vector representations (i.e. distributed word representations) that could capture the semantic similarity between words, such as continuous bags of words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013b) and global vectors (GloVe) (Pennington et al., 2014), have been proposed.

The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1. We investigate the adaptation of phrase-based MT to map a Twitter phrase to a SNOMEDCT concept. 2. We propose to combine our adaptation of phrase-based MT and the similarity between word vector representations to map Twitter phrases to formal medical concepts. 3. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach using phrases from our collection of tweets related to the topic of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 2 Related Work Phrase-based MT models, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004), have been shown to be effective in translation between languages, as they learn local term dependencies, such as collocations, reorderings, insertions and deletions. Koehn et al. (2003) showed that a phrase-based MT technique markedly outperformed traditional wordbased MT techniques on several benchmarks. In this work, we adapt the phrase-based MT technique of Koehn et al. (2003) for the medical text normalisation task. In particular, we use the phrase-based MT technique to translate phrases from Twitter language to formal medical language, before mapping the translated phrases to medical co</context>

For a given Twitter phrase phrt, we find a suitable medical phrase phrm using a translation score, based on a phrase-based model, as follows: scoretranslation(phrm|phrt) = p(phrm|phrt) (1) where p(phrm|phrt) can be calculated using any phrase-based MT technique, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004). We then rank translated phrases phrm based on this translation score. The top-k translated phrases are used for identifying the corresponding medical concept. However, the translated phrase phrm may not be exactly matched with the description of any target medical concepts. We propose two techniques to deal with this problem. For the first technique, we rank the target concepts based on the cosine similarity between the vector representation of phrm and the vector representation of the description of each concept descc: Vphrm · Vdescc simcos(phrm, descc) = ||Vphrm ||× ||Vdescc ||(2) where Vp</context>

These tweets were collected using the Twitter Streaming API5 by filtering on the name of a particular set of drugs that can have adverse reactions to the patients. Note that terms regarding adverse drug reaction (e.g. insomnia) were not used for capturing tweets. From this collection, we use 201 ADR phrases and their corresponding SNOMED-CT concepts annotated by a PhD-level computational linguist. These phrases were anonymised by replacing numbers, user IDs, URIs, locations, email addresses, dates and drug names with appropriate tokens e.g. NUMBER . 4.2 Evaluation Approach We conduct experim</context>

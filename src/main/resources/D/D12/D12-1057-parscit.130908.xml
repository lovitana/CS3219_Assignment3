We propose a new semantic orientation, Ex-
citation, and its automatic acquisition method.
Excitation is a semantic property of predicates
that classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory
and neutral. We show that Excitation is useful
for extracting contradiction pairs (e.g., destroy
cancer 1 develop cancer) and causality pairs
(e.g., increase in crime =:� heighten anxiety).
Our experiments show that with automatically
acquired Excitation knowledge we can extract
one million contradiction pairs and 500,000
causality pairs with about 70% precision from
a 600 million page Web corpus. Furthermore,
by combining these extracted causality and
contradiction pairs, we can generate one mil-
lion plausible causality hypotheses that are not
written in any single sentence in our corpus
with reasonable precision.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99974068">
Recognizing semantic relations between events in
texts is crucial for such NLP tasks as question an-
swering (QA). For example, to answer the question
“What ruined the crops in Japan?” a QA system
must recognize that the sentence “the Fukushima
nuclear power plant caused radioactive pollution
and contaminated the crops in Japan” contains a
causal relation and that contaminate crops entails
ruin crops but contradicts preserve crops.
To facilitate the acquisition of causality, contra-
diction, paraphrase and entailment relations between
events we propose a new semantic orientation, Ex-
citation, that classifies unary predicates (templates,
hereafter) into excitatory, inhibitory and neutral. An
excitatory template entails that the main function or
effect of the referent of its argument is activated or
enhanced (e.g., cause X, preserve X), while an in-
hibitory template entails that it is deactivated or sup-
pressed (e.g., ruin X, contaminate X, prevent X).
Excitation is useful for extracting contradiction;
if two templates with similar distributional profiles
have opposite Excitation polarities, they tend to be
contradictions (e.g., contaminate crops and preserve
crops). With extracted contradictions we can distin-
guish paraphrases from contradictions among distri-
butionally similar phrases. Furthermore, contradic-
tion in itself is important knowledge for Recogniz-
ing Textual Entailment (RTE) (Voorhees, 2008).
Excitation is also a powerful indicator of causal-
ity. In the physical world, the activation or de-
activation of one thing often causes the activation
or deactivation of another. Two excitatory or in-
hibitory templates that co-occur in some temporal
or logical order in the same narrative often describe
a causal chain of events, like “the Fukushima nu-
clear power plant caused radioactive pollution and
contaminated crops in Japan”.
In this paper we propose both the concept of Ex-
citation and an automatic method for its acquisition.
Our method acquires Excitation templates based on
certain natural, language independent constraints on
narrative structures found in text. We also propose
acquisition methods for contradiction and causal-
ity relations based on Excitation. Our methods ex-
tract one million contradiction pairs with over 70%
precision, and 500,000 causality pairs with about
70% precision from a 600 million page Web corpus.
Moreover, by combining these extracted causality
pairs and contradiction pairs, we generated one mil-
lion plausible causality hypotheses that were not

2 What is Excitation?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999923632653061">
Excitation classifies templates into excitatory, in-
hibitory, and neutral, as explained below.
excitatory templates entail that the function, ef-
fect, purpose or role of their argument’s refer-
ent is activated or enhanced. (e.g., cause X, buy
X, produce X, import X, increase X, enable X)
inhibitory templates entail that the function, ef-
fect, purpose or role of their argument’s refer-
ent is deactivated or suppressed. (e.g., prevent
X, discard X, remedy X, decrease X, disable X)
neutral templates are neither excitatory nor in-
hibitory. (e.g., consider X, proportional to X,
related to X, evaluate X, close to X)
For example, when fire fills the X slot of cause X,
it suggests that the effect of fire is activated. If pre-
vent X’s slot is filled with flu, the effect of flu is sup-
pressed. In this study, we aim to acquire excitatory
and inhibitory templates that are useful for extract-
ing contradiction and causality, though neutral tem-
plates are the most frequent in our data (See Section
5.1). Collectively we call excitatory and inhibitory
templates Excitation templates, and excitatory and
inhibitory two opposite polarities.
Excitation is independent of the good/bad seman-
tic orientation. (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown,
1997; Turney, 2002; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).
For example, sophisticate X and complicate X are
both excitatory, but only the former has a positive
connotation. Similarly, remedy X and degrade X are
both inhibitory but only the latter is negative.
General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) deals with
semantic factors some of which were proposed by
Osgood et al. (1957). Their ‘activity’ factor involves
binary opposition between ‘active’ and ‘passive.’
Notice that activity and Excitation are independent.
In General Inquirer, both accelerate X and abolish
X are active, but only the former is excitatory. Both
accept X and abate X are passive, but only the lat-
ter is inhibitory. Pustejovsky (1995) proposed telic
and agentive roles, which inspired our excitatory no-
tion, but they have no corresponding notion of in-
hibitory. Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) acquired
the increase/decrease semantic orientation, which is
a subclass of Excitation.
Excitation is inverted if a template’s predicate is
negated. For example, preserve X is excitatory,
while don’t preserve X is inhibitory. We acknowl-
edge that this may seem somewhat counter-intuitive
and will address this issue in future work.

3 Excitation Template Acquisition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
This section presents our acquisition method of Ex-
citation templates. We introduce constraints in the
co-occurrence of templates in text that seem both ro-
bust and language independent in Section 3.1. Our
method exploits these constraints for the acquisition
of Excitation templates. First we construct a tem-
plate network where nodes are templates and links
represent that two connected templates have either
SAME or OPPOSITE polarities. Given 46 manually
prepared seed templates we calculate the Excitation
value of each template, a value in range [−1, 1] that
is positive if the template is excitatory and negative
if it is inhibitory. Technically, our method treats all
templates as excitatory or inhibitory, and, upon com-
pletion, regards templates with small absolute Exci-
tation values as neutral.
The whole method is a bootstrapping process.
Each iteration expands the network and the Excita-
tion value of each template is (re-)calculated.

3.1 Characteristics of Excitation Templates
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9952021875">
Our method exploits natural discourse constraints on
the possible combinations of (a) the polarity of co-
occurring templates, (b) the nouns that fill their ar-
gument slots and (c) the connectives that link the
templates in a given sentence. Table 1 shows the
constraints and Figure 1 shows examples that will
be explained shortly. Though our target is Japanese
we believe these constraints are universal discourse
principles, and as such not language dependent. Ex-
amples are given in English for ease of explanation.
We first identify two categories of connectives
in our target sentences: AND/THUS-type (e.g., and,
thus and since) and BUT-type (e.g., but and though).
Both types suggest a sort of consistency or inconsis-
tency between predicates. We manually classified
169 frequently used connectives into AND/THUS-

(smoke X is excitatory, not suffer X is inhibitory.)

and BUT-type (See supplementary materials).
Next we extract sentences from the Web in which
two templates co-occur and are joined by one of
these connectives, and then classify the noun pairs
filling the templates’ argument slots into “positively-
associated” and “negatively-associated” noun pairs
(PNPs and NNPs). Mirroring our definition of Excita-
tion, PNPs are noun pairs in which the referent of the
first noun facilitates the emergence of the referent
of the second noun. PNPs can range from causally
related noun pairs like (cigarettes, lung cancer) to
“material-product” relation pairs like (semiconduc-
tor, electronic circuit). We found that PNPs only
fill the argument slots of (a) same Excitation polar-
ity templates connected by AND/THUS-type connec-
tives (examples 1 and 2 in Figure 1), or (b) opposite
Excitation polarity templates connected by a BUT-
type connectives (examples 3 and 4). Violating such
constraints (example 7) seems unnatural. Similarly,
NNPs are noun pairs in which the referent of one
noun suppresses the emergence of the referent of the
other noun. Examples include such “inverse causal-
ity” pairs as (cancer treatment, cancer). NNPs only
fill the argument slots of (a) opposite Excitation po-
larity templates connected by AND/THUS-type con-
nectives (example 5), or (b) same polarity templates
connected by a BUT-type connective (example 6).
All these constraints are summarized in Table 1,
which we will call the constraint matrix. Accord-
ing to the constraint matrix, we can know whether
two templates’ polarities are the same or opposite if
we know whether a noun pair filling the two tem-
plates’ slots is PNP or NNP. Conversely, we can
know whether a noun pair is PNP or NNP if we know
whether two templates whose slots are filled with
the noun pair have the same or opposite polarities.
We believe these constraints capture certain univer-
sal principles of discourse, since it is difficult in any
language to produce natural sounding sentences that
violate these constraints. We empirically confirm
their validity for Japanese in Section 5.1.

3.2 Bootstrapping Approach to Excitation
Template Acquisition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909303030303">
To calculate the Excitation values for the templates,
we construct a template network where templates
are connected by links indicating polarity agreement
between two connected templates (either SAME or
OPPOSITE polarity), as determined by the constraint
matrix. Excitation values are determined by spread-
ing activation applied to the network, given a small
number of manually prepared seed templates.
However, we cannot construct the network unless
we know whether each noun pair is PNP or NNP, due
to the configuration of the constraint matrix, and cur-
rently we have no feasible method to classify all of
them into PNPs and NNPs in advance. We therefore
adopt a bootstrapping method (Figure 2) that starts
from manually prepared excitatory and inhibitory
seed templates (Step 1 in Figure 2). Our method
begins by extracting noun pairs from the Web that
co-occur with two seed templates connected by a
AND/THUS- or BUT-type connective, and classifies
these noun pairs into PNPs and NNPs based on the
constraint matrix (Steps 2 and 3). Next, we automat-
ically extract additional (non-seed) template pairs
from the Web that co-occur with these PNPs and
NNPs. Links (either SAME or OPPOSITE) between
all template pairs are determined by the constraint
matrix (Step 4), and we construct a template network
from both seed and non-seed template pairs (Step 5).
Our method calculates the Excitation values for
all the templates in the network by first assign-
ing Excitation values +1 and −1 to the excitatory
and inhibitory seed templates, and applies a spread-
ing activation method proposed by Takamura et al.
(2005) (Step 6) to the network. This method calcu-

1. Prepare initial seed templates with fixed excitation values (either
+1 or −1).
2. Make seed template pairs that are combinations of two seed tem-
plates and a connective (either AND/THUS-type or BUT-type).
3. Extract noun pairs that co-occur with one of the seed template
pairs from the Web. Classify the noun pairs into PNPs and NNPs
based on the constraints matrix. Filter out those noun pairs that
appear as both PNP and NNP on the Web or those whose occur-
rence frequency is less than or equal to F, which is set to 5.
4. Extract additional (non-seed) template pairs that are filled by one
of the PNPs or NNPs from the Web. Determine the link type
(SAME or OPPOSITE) for each template pair based on the con-
straint matrix. If a template pair appears on the Web as having
both link types, we determine its link type by majority vote.
5. Construct the template network from all the template pairs. Re-
move from the network those templates whose number of linked
templates is less than D, which is set to 5.
6. Apply Takamura et al.’s method to the network and fix the Exci-
tation value of each template.
7. Extract the top- and bottom-ranked N x i templates from the
result of Takamura et al.’s method. N is a constant, which is
set to 30. i is the iteration number. They are used as additional
seed templates for the next iteration. The top-ranked templates
are given Excitation value +1 and the bottom-ranked templates
are assigned −1. Go to Step 2.

network constraints imposed by the SAME and OP-
POSITE links, and the Excitation values of the seed
templates (This method is detailed in Section 3.3).
In each iteration i, our method selects the N x i top-
ranked and bottom-ranked templates as additional
seed templates for the next iteration (N is set to 30)
(Step 7). Our method then constructs a new tem-
plate network using the augmented seed templates
and restarts the calculation process. Figure 2 sum-
marizes our bootstrapping process.
Bootstrapping stops after M iterations, with M
set to 7 based on our preliminary experiments.
To prepare the initial seed templates we con-
structed a maximal template network that could in
theory be created by our bootstrapping method. This
maximal network consists of any two templates that
co-occur in a sentence with any connective, regard-
less of their arguments. We manually selected 36
excitatory and 10 inhibitory seed templates from
among 114 templates with the most links in the net-
work (See supplementary materials).

3.3 Determining Excitation in the Network
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953">
This section details Step 6 of our bootstrapping
method, i.e., how Takamura et al.’s method calcu-
lates the Excitation value of each template. Their
method is based on the spin model in physics, where
each electron has a spin of either up or down. We
chose this method due to the straightforward parallel
between the spin model and our Excitation template
model. Both models capture the spreading of acti-
vation (either spin direction or excitation polarity)
between neighboring objects in a network. Deter-
mining the optimal algorithm for this task is beyond
our current scope, but for the purpose of our experi-
ments we found that Takamura et al.’s method gave
satisfactory results.
The spin model defines an energy function on a
spin network, and each electron’s spin can be esti-
mated by minimizing this function:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993554">
E(x,W) = −1/2 x Eijwijxixj
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999871">
Here, xi, xj E x are spins of electrons i and j, and
matrix W = {wij} assigns weights to links between
electrons. We regard templates as electrons and Ex-
citation polarities as their spins (up and down corre-
spond to excitatory and inhibitory). We define the
weight wij of the link between templates i and j as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9934995">
{1/√d(i)d(j) if SAME (i, j)
−1/√d(i)d(j) if OPPOSITE(i, j)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999363285714286">
Here, d(i) denotes the number of templates linked
to i. SAME(i, j) (OPPOSITE(i, j)) indicates a SAME
(OPPOSITE) link exists between i and j. We obtain
excitation values by minimizing the above energy
function. Note that after minimizing E, xi and xj
tend to get the same polarity when wij is positive.
When wij is negative, xi and xj tend to have op-
posite polarities. Initially seed templates are given
values +1 or −1 depending on whether they are ex-
citatory or inhibitory, and others are given 0.
We used SUPPIN (http://www.lr.pi.titech.

an implementation of Takamura et al.’s method. Its
parameter 0 is set to the default value (0.75).

extract two phrases as a contradiction pair if (a)
their templates have opposite Excitation polarities,
(b) they share the same argument noun, and (c) the
part-of-speech of their predicates is the same. Then
the contradiction pairs are ranked by Ct:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.992391">
Ct(p1,p2) = |s1 |X |s2 |X sim(t1,t2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999779375">
Here p1 and p2 are two phrases that satisfy condi-
tions (a), (b) and (c) above, t1 and t2 are their re-
spective templates, and |s1 |and |s2 |are the absolute
values of t1 and t2’s excitation values. sim(t1, t2) is
the distributional similarity proposed by Lin (1998).
Note that “contradiction” here includes what we
call “quasi-contradiction.” This consists of two
phrases such that, if the tendencies of the events they
describe get stronger, they eventually become con-
tradictions. For example, the pair emit smells L re-
duce smells is not logically contradictory since the
two events can happen at the same time. However,
they become almost contradictory when their ten-
dencies get stronger (i.e., emit smells more strongly
L thoroughly reduce smells). We believe quasi-
contradictions are useful for NLP tasks.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997739">
4.2 Causality Extraction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992925925926">
Our second knowledge acquisition method extracts
causality pairs like increase in crime ==&gt;. heighten
anxiety that co-occur with AND/THUS-type connec-
tives in a sentence. The assumption is that if two
templates (t1 and t2) with a strong Excitation ten-
dency are connected by an AND/THUS-type connec-
tive in a sentence, the event described by t1 and its
argument n1 tends to be a cause of the event de-
scribed by t2 and its argument n2. Here, Excitation
strength is expressed by absolute Excitation values.
The intuition is that, if the referent of n1 is strongly
activated or suppressed, it tends to have some causal
effect on the referent of n2 in the same sentence.
We focus on extracting causality pairs that co-
occur with only “non-causal connectives” like and,
which are AND/THUS-type connectives that do NOT
explicitly signal causality, since causal connectives
like thus can mask the effectiveness of Excitation.
We prepared 139 non-causal connectives (See sup-
plementary materials). We extract two templates
such as increase in X and heighten Y co-occurring
with only non-causal connectives, as well as the
noun pair that fills the two templates’ slots (e.g.,
(crime, anxiety)) to obtain causal phrase pairs. In
Japanese, the temporal order between events is usu-
ally determined by precedence in the sentence. Cs
ranks the obtained causality pairs:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.996645">
Cs(p1,p2) = |s1 |X |s2|
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.97276375">
Here p1 and p2 are the phrases of causality pair, and
|s1 |and |s2 |are absolute Excitation values of p1’s
and p2’s templates. As is common in the literature,
this notion of causality should be interpreted prob-
abilistically rather than logically, i.e., we interpret
causality A ==&gt;. B as “if A happens, the probability of
B increases”. This interpretation is often more use-
ful for NLP tasks than a strict logical interpretation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997496">
4.3 Causality Hypothesis Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944615384615">
Our third knowledge acquisition method generates
plausible causality hypotheses that are not written in
any single sentence using the previously extracted
contradiction and causality pairs. We assume that if
a causal relation (e.g., increase in crime ==&gt;. heighten
anxiety ) is valid, its inverse (e.g., decrease in crime
==&gt;. diminish anxiety ) is often valid as well. From
a logical definition of causation, taking the inverse
of an implication obviously does not preserve valid-
ity. However, at least under our probabilistic inter-
pretation, taking the inverse of a given causality pair
using the extracted contradiction pairs proves to be
a viable strategy for generating non-trivial causality
hypotheses, as our experiments in Section 5.4 show.
For an extracted causality pair, we generate its
inverse as a causality hypothesis by replacing both
phrases in the original pair with their contradiction
counterparts. For instance, a causality hypothesis
decrease in crime ==&gt;. diminish anxiety is generated
from a causality increase in crime ==&gt;. heighten anxi-
ety by two contradictions, decrease in crime L in-
crease in crime and diminish anxiety L heighten
anxiety. Since we are interested in finding new
causal hypotheses, we filter out hypotheses whose
phrase pair co-occurs in a sentence in our corpus.
Remaining causality hypotheses are ranked by Hp.

Here, q1 and q2 are two phrases of a causality hy-
pothesis. p1 and p2 are two phrases of a hypothesis’s
original causality. That is, p1 L q1 and p2 L q2 are
contradiction pairs, and Ct(p1, q1) and Ct(p2, q2)
are their contradiction scores. Cs&apos;(p1, p2) is the
original causality’s causality score. Cs&apos; can be Cs

|s1 |and |s2 |are absolute Excitation values of p1’s

of (n1, n2) with polarity-identical template pairs (if
(n1, n2) is PNP) or with polarity-opposite template
pairs (if (n1, n2) is NNP). Thus, npfreq indicates a
sort of association strength between two nouns.

5 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986">
This section shows that our template acquisition
method acquired many Excitation templates. More-
over, using only the acquired templates we extracted
one million contradiction pairs with more than 70%
precision, and 500,000 causality pairs with about
70% precision. Further, using only these extracted
contradiction and causality pairs we generated one
million causality hypotheses with 57% precision.
In our experiments we removed evaluation sam-
ples containing the initial seed templates and exam-
ples used for annotation instruction from the evalua-
tion data. Three annotators (not the authors) marked
all evaluation samples, which were randomly shuf-
fled so that they could not identify which sample was
produced by which method. Information about the
predicted labels or ranks was also removed from the
evaluation data. Final judgments were made by ma-
jority vote between the annotators. They were non-
experts without formal training in linguistics or se-
mantics. See supplementary materials for our anno-
tation manuals (translated into English).
We used 600 million Japanese Web pages
(Akamine et al., 2010) parsed by KNP (Kawahara
and Kurohashi, 2006) as a corpus. We restricted

5.1 Excitation Template Acquisition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999651849056604">
We show that our proposed method for template ex-
traction (PROPtmp) successfully acquired many Ex-
citation templates from which we obtained a huge
number of contradiction and causality pairs, and that
Excitation is a reasonably comprehensible notion
even for non-experts. We also show that PROPtmp
outperformed two baselines by a large margin.
The template network constructed by PROPtmp
contained 10,825 templates. Among these, the boot-
strapping process classified 8,685 templates as exci-
tatory and 2,140 as inhibitory. Note that these can-
didates in fact also contain neutral templates, as ex-
plained at the beginning of Section 3.
Baselines The baseline methods are ALLEXC and
SIM. ALLEXC regards all templates that are ran-
domly extracted from the Web as excitatory, since in
our data excitatory templates outnumber inhibitory
ones. Actually, in our data neutral templates rep-
resent the most frequent class, but since our objec-
tive is to acquire excitatory and inhibitory templates,
a baseline marking all templates as neutral would
make little sense. SIM is a distributional similarity
baseline that takes as input the same 10,825 tem-
plates of PROPtmp above, constructs a network by
connecting two templates whose distributional simi-
larity is greater than zero, and regards two connected
templates as having the same polarity. The weight
of the links between templates is set to their distri-
butional similarity based on Lin (1998). Then SIM
is given the same initial seed templates as PROPtmp,
by which it calculates the Excitation values of tem-
plates using Takamura et al.’s method. As a result,
SIM assigned positive Excitation values to all tem-
plates, and except for the 10 inhibitory initial seed
templates no templates were regarded inhibitory.
Evaluation scheme We randomly sampled 100
templates each from PROPtmp’s 8,685 excitatory
candidates, PROPtmp’s 2,140 inhibitory candidates,
all the ALLEXC’s templates, and all the SIM’s tem-
plates, i.e., 400 templates in total. To make the an-
notators’ judgements easier, we randomly filled the
argument slot of each template with a noun filling its
argument slot in our Web corpus. Three annotators
labeled each sample (a combination of a template
and a noun) as ‘excitatory,’ ‘inhibitory,’ ‘neutral,’ or
‘undecided’ if they were not sure about its label.
Results for excitatory In the top graph in Fig-
ure 3, ‘Proposed’ shows PROPtmp’s precision curve.
The curve is drawn from its 100 samples whose X-
axis positions represent their ranks. We plot a dot for
every 5 samples. Among the 100 samples, 37 were
judged as excitatory, 6 as inhibitory, 45 as neutral,
and 6 as ‘undecided’. For the remaining 6 samples,

the three annotators gave three different labels and
the label was not fixed (‘split-votes’ hereafter). For
calculating precision, only the 37 samples labeled
excitatory were regarded as correct. PROPtmp out-
performed all baselines by a large margin, with an
estimated 70% precision for the top 2,000 templates.
‘Allexc’ and ‘Sim’ in Figure 3 denote ALLEXC and
SIM. Among ALLEXC’s 100 samples, 19 were
judged as excitatory, 5 as inhibitory, 74 as neutral,
and 2 as ‘undecided’. SIM’s low performance re-
flects the fact that templates with opposite polarities
are sometimes distributionally similar, and as a re-
sult get connected by SAME links.
Results for inhibitory ‘Proposed’ in the bottom
graph in Figure 3 shows the precision curve drawn
from the 100 samples of PROPtmp’s inhibitory can-
didates. Among the 100 samples, 41 were judged as
inhibitory, 15 as excitatory, 32 as neutral, 4 as ‘unde-
cided’, and 8 as ’split-votes’. Only the 41 inhibitory
samples were regarded as correct. From the curve
we estimate that PROPtmp achieved about 70% pre-
cision for the top 500. Note that SIM could not ac-
quire any inhibitory templates, yet we can think of
no other reasonable baseline for this task.
Inter-annotator agreement The Fleiss’ kappa
(Fleiss, 1971) of annotator judgements was 0.48
(moderate agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977)). For
training, the annotators were given a one-page anno-
tation manual (see supplementary materials), which
basically described the same contents in Section 2,
in addition to 14 examples of excitatory, 14 exam-
ples of inhibitory, and 6 examples of neutral tem-
plates that were manually prepared by the authors.
Using the manual and the examples, we instructed
all the annotators face-to-face for a few hours. We
also made sure the evaluation data did not contain
any examples used during instruction.
Observations about argument positions Among
the 200 evaluation samples of PROPtmp (for both ex-
citatory and inhibitory evaluations), 52 were judged
as excitatory, 47 as inhibitory, and 77 as neutral. For
the excitatory templates, the numbers of nominative,
topic, accusative, dative, and instrumental argument
positions are 15, 11, 10, 8, and 8, respectively. For
the inhibitory templates, the numbers are 17, 11, 16,
3, and 0. For the neutral templates, the numbers are
8, 23, 17, 21, and 8. Accordingly, we found no no-
ticeable bias with regard to their numbers. Likewise,
we found no noticeable bias regarding their useful-
ness for contradiction and causality acquisition re-
ported shortly, too.
Summary PROPtmp works well, as it outperforms
the baselines. Its performance demonstrates the va-
lidity of our constraint matrix in Table 1. Besides,
since our annotators were non-experts but showed
moderate agreement, we conclude that Excitation is
a reasonably comprehensible notion.

This section shows that our proposed method for
contradiction extraction (PROPcont) extracted one
million contradiction pairs with more than 70% pre-
cision, and that Excitation values are useful for con-
tradiction ranking. As input for PROPcont we took
the top 2,000 excitatory and the top 500 inhibitory
templates from the previous experiment (i.e., the
other templates were regarded as neutral).
Baselines Our baseline methods are RANDcont
and PROPcont-NE. RANDcont randomly combines
two phrases, each consisting of a template and a
noun that they share. It does not rank its output.
PROPcont-NE is the same as PROPcont except that it
does not use Excitation values; ranking is based only
on sim(t1, t2). PROPcont-NE does combine phrases
with opposite template polarities, just like PROPcont.

Results ‘Proposed’ in Figure 4 shows the preci-
sion curve of PROPcont. PROPcont achieved an esti-
mated 70% precision for its top one million results.
Readers might wonder whether PROPcont’s output
consists of a small number of template pairs that are
filled with many different nouns. If this were the
case, PROPcont’s performance would be somewhat
misleading. However, we found that PROPcont’s 200
samples contained 194 different template pairs, sug-
gesting that our method can acquire a large variety
of contradiction phrases. ‘Proposed-ne’ is the pre-
cision curve for PROPcont-NE. Its precision is more
than 10% lower than PROPcont at the top one million
results. ‘Random’ shows that RANDcont’s precision
is only 4%. Table 2 shows examples of PROPcont’s
outputs and their English translation. The labels
‘Cont,’ ‘Quasi’ and ‘X’ denote whether a pair is con-
tradictory, quasi-contradictory, or not contradictory.
Among PROPcont’s 145 samples judged by the an-
notators as contradiction, 46 were judged as quasi-
contradictory by one of the authors. The first X
case in Table 2 was caused by the template, X を改
善する (improve X). It is tricky since it is excitatory
when taking arguments like function, while it is in-
hibitory when taking arguments like disorder. How-
ever, PROPtmp currently cannot distinguish these us-
ages and judged it as inhibitory in our experiments
in Section 5.1, though it must be interpreted as ex-
citatory for the X case. The second X case was due
to PROPtmp’s error; it incorrectly judged the neutral
template, X が関係する (related to X), as inhibitory.

Summary PROPcont is a low cost but high perfor-
mance method, since it acquired one million con-
tradiction pairs with over 70% precision from only
the 46 initial seed templates. Besides, Excitation
contributes to contradiction ranking since PROPcont
outperformed PROPcont-NE by a 10% margin for the

Results ‘Proposed’ in Figure 5 is the precision

causal pairs since its 100 samples contained 91 dif-
ferent template pairs. Table 3 shows examples of
PROPcaus’s output along with English translations.
The labels ‘✓’ and ‘X’ denote whether a pair is
causality or not. The X cases in Table 3 were
exceptions to our assumption described in Section
4.2; even if two Excitation templates co-occur in a
sentence with an AND/THUS-type connective, they
sometimes do not constitute causality. Actually, the
first X case consists of two phrases that co-occurred
in a sentence with a (non-causal) AND/THUS-type
connective but described two events that happen as
the effects of introducing the RAID storage system;
both are caused by the third event. In the second X
case, the two phrases co-occurred in a sentence with
a (non-causal) AND/THUS-type connective but just
described two opposing events.
Summary PROPcaus performs well since it ex-
tracted 500,000 causality pairs with about 70%
precision. Moreover, Excitation values contribute
to causality ranking since PROPcaus outperformed
FREQ by a large margin. Then we conclude that our
assumption on causality extraction is confirmed.

While the semantic orientation involving good/bad
(or desirable/undesirable) has been extensively stud-
ied (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney,
2002; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009; Velikovich et
al., 2010), we believe Excitation represents a gen-
uinely new semantic orientation.
Most previous methods of contradiction extrac-
tion require either thesauri like Roget’s or WordNet
(Harabagiu et al., 2006; Mohammad et al., 2008; de
Marneffe et al., 2008) or large training data for su-
pervision (Turney, 2008). In contrast, our method
requires only a few seed templates. Lin et al. (2003)
used a few “incompatibility” patterns to acquire
antonyms, but they did not report their method’s per-
formance on the incompatibility identification task.
Many methods for extracting causality or script-
like knowledge between events exist (Girju, 2003;
Torisawa, 2005; Torisawa, 2006; Abe et al., 2008;
Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Do et al., 2011; Shi-
bata and Kurohashi, 2011), but none uses a notion
similar to Excitation. As we have shown, we expect
that Excitation will improve their performance.
Regarding the acquisition of semantic knowledge
that is not explicitly written in corpora, Tsuchida et
al. (2011) proposed a novel method to generate se-
mantic relation instances as hypotheses using auto-
matically discovered inference rules. We think that
automatically generating plausible semantic knowl-
edge that is not written (explicitly) in corpora as hy-
potheses and augmenting semantic knowledge base
is important for the discovery of so-called “unknown
unknowns” (Torisawa et al., 2010), among others.

We proposed a new semantic orientation, Excitation,
and its acquisition method. Our experiments showed
that Excitation allows to acquire one million con-
tradiction pairs with over 70% precision, as well as
causality pairs and causality hypotheses of the same
volume with reasonable precision from the Web. We
plan to make all our acquired knowledge resources
available to the research community soon (Visit
http://www.alagin.jp/index-e.html).
We will investigate additional applications of Ex-
citation in future work. For instance, we expect that
Excitation and its related semantic knowledge ac-
quired in this study will improve the performance
of Why-QA system like the one proposed by Oh et
al. (2012).

Excitation is a semantic property of predicates that classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory and neutral. We show that Excitation is useful extracting contradiction pairs (e.g., and causality pairs in crime Our experiments show that with automatically acquired Excitation knowledge we can extract one million contradiction pairs and 500,000 causality pairs with about 70% precision from a 600 million page Web corpus. Furthermore, by combining these extracted causality and contradiction pairs, we can generate one million plausible causality hypotheses that are not written in any single sentence in our corpus with reasonable precision.</abstract>

General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) deals with semantic factors some of which were proposed by Osgood et al. (1957). Their ‘activity’ factor involves binary opposition between ‘active’ and ‘passive.’ Notice that activity and Excitation are independent. In General Inquirer, both accelerate X and abolish X are active, but only the former is excitatory. Both accept X and abate X are passive, but only the latter is inhibitory. Pustejovsky (1995) proposed telic and agentive roles, which inspired our excitatory notion, but they have no corresponding notion of inhibitory. Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) acquired the increase/decrease semantic orientation, which is a subclass of Excitation. Excitation is inverted if a template’s predicate is negated. For example, preserve X is excitatory, while don’t preserve X is inhibitory. We acknowledge that this may seem somewhat counter-intuitive and will address this issue in future work. 3 Excitation Template Acquisition This section presents our acquisition method of Excitation templates.

Results for inhibitory ‘Proposed’ in the bottom graph in Figure 3 shows the precision curve drawn from the 100 samples of PROPtmp’s inhibitory candidates. Among the 100 samples, 41 were judged as inhibitory, 15 as excitatory, 32 as neutral, 4 as ‘undecided’, and 8 as ’split-votes’. Only the 41 inhibitory samples were regarded as correct. From the curve we estimate that PROPtmp achieved about 70% precision for the top 500. Note that SIM could not acquire any inhibitory templates, yet we can think of no other reasonable baseline for this task. Inter-annotator agreement The Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss, 1971) of annotator judgements was 0.48 (moderate agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977)). For training, the annotators were given a one-page annotation manual (see supplementary materials), which basically described the same contents in Section 2, in addition to 14 examples of excitatory, 14 examples of inhibitory, and 6 examples of neutral templates that were manually prepared by the authors. Using the manual and the examples, we instructed all the annotators face-to-face for a few hours. We also made sure the evaluation data did not contain any examples used during instruction.

If prevent X’s slot is filled with flu, the effect of flu is suppressed. In this study, we aim to acquire excitatory and inhibitory templates that are useful for extracting contradiction and causality, though neutral templates are the most frequent in our data (See Section 5.1). Collectively we call excitatory and inhibitory templates Excitation templates, and excitatory and inhibitory two opposite polarities. Excitation is independent of the good/bad semantic orientation. (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009). For example, sophisticate X and complicate X are both excitatory, but only the former has a positive connotation. Similarly, remedy X and degrade X are both inhibitory but only the latter is negative. General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) deals with semantic factors some of which were proposed by Osgood et al.

Among the 100 samples, 41 were judged as inhibitory, 15 as excitatory, 32 as neutral, 4 as ‘undecided’, and 8 as ’split-votes’. Only the 41 inhibitory samples were regarded as correct. From the curve we estimate that PROPtmp achieved about 70% precision for the top 500. Note that SIM could not acquire any inhibitory templates, yet we can think of no other reasonable baseline for this task. Inter-annotator agreement The Fleiss’ kappa (Fleiss, 1971) of annotator judgements was 0.48 (moderate agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977)). For training, the annotators were given a one-page annotation manual (see supplementary materials), which basically described the same contents in Section 2, in addition to 14 examples of excitatory, 14 examples of inhibitory, and 6 examples of neutral templates that were manually prepared by the authors. Using the manual and the examples, we instructed all the annotators face-to-face for a few hours. We also made sure the evaluation data did not contain any examples used during instruction.

Concretely, we wij = 622 extract two phrases as a contradiction pair if (a) their templates have opposite Excitation polarities, (b) they share the same argument noun, and (c) the part-of-speech of their predicates is the same. Then the contradiction pairs are ranked by Ct: Ct(p1,p2) = |s1 |X |s2 |X sim(t1,t2) Here p1 and p2 are two phrases that satisfy conditions (a), (b) and (c) above, t1 and t2 are their respective templates, and |s1 |and |s2 |are the absolute values of t1 and t2’s excitation values. sim(t1, t2) is the distributional similarity proposed by Lin (1998). Note that “contradiction” here includes what we call “quasi-contradiction.” This consists of two phrases such that, if the tendencies of the events they describe get stronger, they eventually become contradictions. For example, the pair emit smells L reduce smells is not logically contradictory since the two events can happen at the same time. However, they become almost contradictory when their tendencies get stronger (i.e., emit smells more strongly L thoroughly reduce smells).

Actually, in our data neutral templates represent the most frequent class, but since our objective is to acquire excitatory and inhibitory templates, a baseline marking all templates as neutral would make little sense. SIM is a distributional similarity baseline that takes as input the same 10,825 templates of PROPtmp above, constructs a network by connecting two templates whose distributional similarity is greater than zero, and regards two connected templates as having the same polarity. The weight of the links between templates is set to their distributional similarity based on Lin (1998). Then SIM is given the same initial seed templates as PROPtmp, by which it calculates the Excitation values of templates using Takamura et al.’s method. As a result, SIM assigned positive Excitation values to all templates, and except for the 10 inhibitory initial seed templates no templates were regarded inhibitory. Evaluation scheme We randomly sampled 100 templates each from PROPtmp’s 8,685 excitatory candidates, PROPtmp’s 2,140 inhibitory candidates, all the ALLEXC’s templates, and all the SIM’s templates, i.e., 400 templates in total.

If prevent X’s slot is filled with flu, the effect of flu is suppressed. In this study, we aim to acquire excitatory and inhibitory templates that are useful for extracting contradiction and causality, though neutral templates are the most frequent in our data (See Section 5.1). Collectively we call excitatory and inhibitory templates Excitation templates, and excitatory and inhibitory two opposite polarities. Excitation is independent of the good/bad semantic orientation. (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009). For example, sophisticate X and complicate X are both excitatory, but only the former has a positive connotation. Similarly, remedy X and degrade X are both inhibitory but only the latter is negative. General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) deals with semantic factors some of which were proposed by Osgood et al. (1957). Their ‘activity’ factor involves binary opposition between ‘active’ and ‘passive.’ Notice that activity and Excitation are independent. In General Inquirer, both accelerate X and abolish X are active, but only the former is excitatory. Both accept X</context>

Excitation is useful for extracting contradiction; if two templates with similar distributional profiles have opposite Excitation polarities, they tend to be contradictions (e.g., contaminate crops and preserve crops). With extracted contradictions we can distinguish paraphrases from contradictions among distributionally similar phrases. Furthermore, contradiction in itself is important knowledge for Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) (Voorhees, 2008). Excitation is also a powerful indicator of causality. In the physical world, the activation or deactivation of one thing often causes the activation or deactivation of another. Two excitatory or inhibitory templates that co-occur in some temporal or logical order in the same narrative often describe a causal chain of events, like “the Fukushima nuclear power plant caused radioactive pollution and contaminated crops in Japan”. In this paper we propose both the concept of Excitation and an automatic method for its acquisition. Our method acquires Excitation templates based on certain natural, </context>

<bodyText confidence="0.999492954545455">
In this paper, we propose a Connective-
driven Dependency Tree (CDT) scheme
to represent the discourse rhetorical
structure in Chinese language, with ele-
mentary discourse units as leaf nodes
and connectives as non-leaf nodes, large-
ly motivated by the Penn Discourse
Treebank and the Rhetorical Structure
Theory. In particular, connectives are
employed to directly represent the hier-
archy of the tree structure and the rhetor-
ical relation of a discourse, while the nu-
clei of discourse units are globally de-
termined with reference to the depend-
ency theory. Guided by the CDT scheme,
we manually annotate a Chinese Dis-
course Treebank (CDTB) of 500 docu-
ments. Preliminary evaluation justifies
the appropriateness of the CDT scheme
to Chinese discourse analysis and the
usefulness of our manually annotated
CDTB corpus.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998543022222222">
It is well-known that interpretation of a text re-
quires understanding of its rhetorical relation
hierarchy since discourse units rarely exist in
isolation. Such discourse structure is fundamen-
tal to many text-based applications, such as
summarization (Marcu, 2000) and question-
answering (Verberne et al., 2007). Due to the
wide and potential use of discourse structure,
constructing discourse resources has been at-
tracting more and more attention in recent years.
In comparison with English, there are much
fewer discourse resources for Chinese which
largely restricts the researches in Chinese dis-
course analysis.
The general notion of discourse structure
mainly consists of discourse unit, connective,
structure, relation and nuclearity. However, pre-
vious studies on discourse failed to fully express
these kinds of information. For example, the
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and
Thompson, 1988) represents a discourse as a
tree with phrases or clauses as elementary dis-
course units (EDUs). However, RST ignores the
importance of connectives to a great extent. Fig-
ure 1 gives an example tree structure with four
EDUs (e1-e4). In comparison, Penn Discourse
Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) adopts
the predicate-argument view of discourse rela-
tion, with discourse connective as predicate and
two text spans as its arguments. Example (1)
shows an explicit reason relation signaled by the
discourse connective “particularly if” and an
implicit result relation represented by the insert-
ed discourse connective “so”, with Arg1 in ital-
ics and Arg2 in bold. However, as a connective
and its arguments are determined in a local con-
textual window, it is normally difficult to deduce
a complete discourse structure from such a con-
nective-argument scheme. In this sense, the
PDTB at best only provides a partial solution to
the discourse structure.

Obviously, both RST and PDTB have their
own advantages and disadvantages in represent-
ing different characteristics of the discourse
structure. In this paper, we attempt to propose a
new scheme to Chinese discourse structure,
adopt advantages of the tree structure from RST
and connective from PDTB. Meanwhile, the
special characteristics of Chinese discourse
structure are well addressed.
First, it is difficult to define EDU in Chinese
due to the frequent occurrence of the ellipsis of
subjects, objects and predicates, and the lack of
functional marks for EDU. Second, the connec-
tives in Chinese omit much more frequently than
those in English with about 82.0% vs. 54.5% in
Zhou and Xue (2012). In Example (2), there are
even no explicit connectives. Third, previous
studies have shown the difference in classifying
Chinese discourse relations from English (Xing,
2001; Huang and Liao, 2011). This suggests that
the discourse relations defined for English (both
RST and PDTB) are not readily suitable for
Chinese. Finally, the nucleus of a Chinese dis-
course relation is normally not directly related to
a particular relation type but should be dynami-
cally determined from the global meaning of a
discourse.

In this paper, we present a Connective-driven
Dependency Tree (CDT) discourse representa-
tion scheme, which takes advantage of both RST
and PDTB, with elementary discourse units
(limited to clauses) as leaf nodes and connec-
tives as non-leaf nodes. Especially, we define
EDU from three aspects, and employ the con-
nective’ level and semantic to indicate the rhe-
torical structure and the discourse relation. Be-
sides, the nuclearity of discourse units in a dis-
course relation is decided on the overall dis-
course meaning. On the basis, we adopt the CDT
scheme to annotate a certain scale corpus, called
Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) thereafter
in this paper. Evaluation shows the appropriate-
ness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse
analysis.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 overviews related work. In Section 3,
we present the CDT discourse representation
scheme. In Section 4, we describe the annotation
of the CDTB corpus. Section 5 compares CDTB
with other major discourse corpora. Section 6
gives the experimental results on EDU recogni-
tion, the crucial step for discourse parsing. Final-
ly, conclusion is given in section 7.

<bodyText confidence="0.999877484848485">
In the past decade, several discourse corpora for
English have emerged, with the Rhetorical
Structure Theory Discourse Treebank (RST-DT)
(Carlson et al., 2003) and the Penn Discourse
Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) most
prevalent.
In the RST framework, a text is represented as
a discourse tree, with non-overlapping text spans
(either phrases or clauses) as leaves, and adja-
cent nodes are related through particular rhetori-
cal relations to form a discourse sub-tree, which
is then related to other adjacent nodes in the tree
structure. According to RST, there are two types
of discourse relations, mononuclear and multi-
nuclear. Figure 1 shows an example of discourse
tree representation, following the notational
convention of RST. Among the four EDUs (e1-
e4), e1 and e2 are connected by a mononuclear
relation “attribution”, where e1 is the nucleus,
the span (e1-e2) and the EDU e3 are further
connected by a multi-nuclear relation “same-
unit”, where they are equally salient. Annotated
according to the RST framework, the RST-DT
consists of 385 documents from the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ). Besides, the original 24 dis-
course relations defined by Mann and Thompson
(1988) are further divided into a set of 18 rela-
tion classes with 78 finer grained rhetorical rela-
tions in RST-DT.
As the largest discourse corpus so far, the
Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) contains over
one million words from WSJ. With EDUs lim-
ited to clauses, the PDTB adopts the predicate-

argument view of discourse relations, with con-
nective as predicate and two text spans as its
arguments. Example (1) shows two annotation
tokens for the connective “particularly if” and
“so”. The current version of PDTB 2.0 annotates
40600 tokens, including 18459 explicit relations
of 100 distinct types (e.g. “particularly if” and
“if” are the same type) and 16224 implicit dis-
course relations of 102 distinct token types. Be-
sides, PDTB provides a three level hierarchy of
relation tags with the first level consisting of
four major relation classes (Temporal, Contin-
gency, Comparison, and Expansion), which are
further divided into 16 types and 23 subtypes.
In comparison, there are few researches on
Chinese discourse annotation (Xue, 2005a; Chen,
2006; Yue, 2008; Huang and Chen, 2011; Zhou
and Xue, 2012), with no exception employing
existing RST or PDTB frameworks. For exam-
ple, Zhou and Xue (2012) use the PDTB annota-
tion guidelines to annotate Chinese discourse
with 98 files from Chinese Treebank (Xue et al.,
2005b) of Xinhua newswire. In particular, they
adopt a lexically grounded approach and make
some adaptation based on the linguistic and sta-
tistical characteristics of Chinese text, with Arg1
and Arg2 defined semantically and the senses of
discourse relations annotated besides connec-
tives and their lexical alternatives. The agree-
ment on relation types reaches 95.1% and the
agreement on implicit relations with exact span
match reaches 76.9%.
Instead, Chen (2006) and Yue (2008) use RST
to annotate Chinese discourse. Chen (2006) se-
lects comma as the segmentation signal of EDUs
(in Example (2), “据悉(According to reports)”
will be segmented as an EDU), and finds that
RST fails to deal with some special features of
Chinese. Yue (2008) manually annotates a set of
97 texts according to RST and shows the cross-
lingual transferability of RST to Chinese. How-
ever, it also shows that EDUs in Chinese are
much different from those in English, and many
relation types in Chinese have no correspond-
ence to English, and vice versa.

3 Connective-driven Dependency Tree

<bodyText confidence="0.999858844444445">
An appropriate representation scheme is funda-
mental to linguistic resource construction. With
reference to various theories and representation
scheme on the tree structure and nuclearity of
RST, the connective, relation and discourse
structure of Chinese complex sentence (Xing,
2001), the sentence-group theory (Cao, 1984),
the connective treatment of PDTB, the conjunc-
tion dependent analysis (Feng and Ji, 2011) and
the center theory of dependency grammar (Hays,
1964), we propose a new discourse representa-
tion scheme for Chinese, called Connective-
driven Dependency Tree (CDT), with EDUs as
leaf nodes and connectives as non-leaf nodes, to
accommodate the special characteristics of the
Chinese language in discourse structure.
For instance, Example (3) consists of 2 sen-
tences, which is part of a paragraph from
“chtb_0001”, and its corresponding CDT repre-
sentation is shown in Figure 2. Here, the number
of “|” in Example (3) stands for the level of
EDUs in CDT and the numbers marked in Fig-
ure 2 (such as 1, 2 etc.) distinguish EDUs. While
an arrow points to the main EDU or main dis-
course unit (called nucleus), the combination of
different EDUs can be considered as EDUs in a
higher level and the new discourse units can thus
be combined into higher-level units from bottom
to up. In this way, the discourse structure can be
expressed as a tree structure via bottom-up com-
bination of EDUs.
Obviously, such discourse structure is con-
structed by two kinds of basic units, EDUs (leaf
nodes) and connectives (non-leaf nodes). On the
one hand, connectives can represent the dis-
course structure by its hierarchical level in the
tree. The discourse structure is independent on
the connective level essentially, rather than the
reverse. On the other hand, connectives them-
selves can represent the discourse relation. This
is why we call the scheme “Connective-driven”.
As for the abstract discourse relation, we can
construct a set of discourse relations, mapping a
connective to discourse relation, according to the
users’ specific requirements.

3.1 Elementary Discourse Unit
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9966890625">
As the leaf nodes of CDT, EDUs are limited to
clauses. In principle, EDUs play a crucial role to
discourse analysis. Since from bottom-up dis-
course combination, EDUs are the start of dis-
course analysis, while from top-down discourse
segmentation, they are the end of discourse
analysis. Unfortunately, since there lacks obvi-
ous distinction between Chinese sentence struc-
ture and phrase structure, it is rather difficult to
define Chinese EDU (clause). Till now, there is
still no widely accepted definition in the Chinese
linguistics community (Wang, 2010). Inspired
by Li et al. (2013a), we give the definition of
Chinese EDU from three perspectives. First,
from the syntactic structure perspective, an EDU
should contain at least one predicate and express
at least one proposition. Second, from the func-
tional perspective, an EDU should be related to
other EDUs with some propositional function,
i.e. not act as a grammatical element of other
EDUs. Finally, from the morphological perspec-
tive, an EDU should be segmented by some
punctuation, e.g. comma, semicolon and period.
We use punctuation because there usually has a
pause between clauses (EDUs), which can be
shown in written commas, semicolons etc
(Huang and Liao, 2011). Normally, it is easy to
handle complex sentences and special sentence
patterns (e.g. serial predicate sentences). For
Example (4), A) is a single sentence with serial
predicate; B) is complex sentence with two
EDUs (clauses):

<bodyText confidence="0.999951857142857">
Take as example, there exist 7 EDUs in Ex-
ample (3), each marked with a number in front.
According to our definition, the fragment “干一
段 时 间 , ... 法 规 条 例 ”(“work for a short
time...has been accumulated” ) in EDU 3 is not
segmented as a EDU since: 1) it acts as a gram-
matical element of other EDUs and has no direct
relationship with other EDUs on propositional
function; 2) it is marked by a pair of quotation
marks and does not end with any punctuation. In
contrast, the fragment “而是借鉴发达...法制轨
道 ”(“but learn developed...legality track.”) is
segment as 4 EDUs since it meets the three crite-
ria in our EDU definition.

3.2 Connective

<bodyText confidence="0.959585066666667">
As non-leaf nodes in the CDT representation,
connectives connect EDUs or discourse units.
Thus, the main criterion of determining whether
an expression is a connective is to check wheth-
er the two fragments it connects are EDUs (or
discourse units). In our scheme, the list of ex-
plicit discourse connectives is judged by a data
driven approach, i.e. with any discourse-like
word or phrase marked as connective in the an-
notation practice, e.g. “因此(therefore)”, “对此
(to this)”, “不是...而是...(is not...but....)”, “使(so
that), “正因为(just because)” in Example (3),
“先...然后(first...then) ”, “同时也(and at the
same time)” in Example (5).

It is worthy of mention that from the part-of-
speech perspective, connectives are not
necessarily conjunctions. For example, in
Example (3) and (5), adverbs “先...然后(first...
then)”, verb phrases “不是...而是(is not...but)”,
and preposition phrases “ 对 此 (to this)” are
determined as connectives. From the
morphological perspective, a connective may
contain more than one word, even discontinuous.
As a common occurring phenomenon in Chinese
discourse, there exist many paired Chinese
connectives, e.g. “不是...而是 (is not...but)” in
Figure 2. Even in some paired connectives, such
as “因为...所以(because...so)”, a word in a
paired connective can appear independently as a
connective. Please note that this may not be
applied to other cases, e.g. “不是...而是 (is
not...but)” as appeared in Example (3). Moreo-
ver, in many cases whether an expression is a
connective or not depends on its meaning, e.g.,
“为 (in order to)” is a connective, while “为
(for)” is not. For the positional distribution, a
connective may appear anywhere, i.e. in the be-
ginning, middle, or the end of the first or second
EDU. Example (3) and (5) show some of cases
in different positions. The above characteristics
pose special challenges on connective determi-
nation in Chinese language.
According to the appearance of a connective
or not, a discourse relation can be either explicit
or implicit. Previous studies have shown the dif-
ficulty of implicit relation recognition in English
due to the omission of connectives (Pitler et al.,
2009; Lin et al., 2009). This becomes even
worse in Chinese since compared with the im-
plicit ratio of 54.5% in English connectives, this
ratio rises up to about 82% in Chinese (Zhou and
Xue, 2012). It is worth noting that the majority
of discourse relations in Chinese are implicit, so
the insertion of a connective in an implicit posi-
tion can significantly ease the understanding of
the discourse. That is, a connective driven repre-
sentation scheme is still applicable to a discourse
with implicit connectives. To help determine
implicit relations, two special strategies are pro-
posed.
First, for each explicit connective, a decision
is made whether or not it can be deleted without
changing the rhetorical relation of a discourse. It
should be emphasized that this constraint is
largely semantic. The motivation behind the re-
moval of explicit connectives is to enlarge im-
plicit instances and help recognize implicit rela-
tions. As shown in Figure 2, we use the paired
mark “()” to indicate that a connective can be
deleted, e.g. connectives “(对此 to this)”, “(因此
therefore)”, “(正因此 just because)”, and the
paired mark “{}” to indicate that a connective
cannot be deleted, e.g. connectives “{ 使 so
that}”, “{不是...而是 is not...but}”.
Second, since a connective can be inserted to
represent an implicit relation, our scheme tries to
insert a connective which can be easily inter-
preted from the semantic perspective with little
ambiguity into the most appropriate place. Most
of the connective insertions for implicit relations
occur between adjacent discourse spans. It is
worth noting that not all implicit connectives are
subjective to the language sense. To mark this
difference, we cluster implicit connectives into
two categories according to their language sens-
es, either “good language intuition” or “bad lan-
guage intuition”. In our scheme, we use the
paired mark “&lt;&gt;”to indicate inserted implicit
connectives, e.g. connectives“&lt;例如 e.g.&gt;”, “&lt;
却 but&gt;” with “good language sense”, connec-
tive “&lt;并且 and&gt;” with “bad language sense”, as
shown in Figure 2.
In some cases, it is possible that there exist
several insertion options for an implicit connec-
tive due to the ambiguity in a discourse. For ex-
ample, in Example (5A), connectives “如果 (if)”
and “只要 (as long as)” are inserted into the first
level to show the two discourse relation options.
As far as this happens, connectives are inserted
and ordered according to annotators’ first intui-
tion.

3.3 Discourse Structure

<bodyText confidence="0.9998508">
In Figure 2, the paragraph is organized as a tree
structure, in which EDUs appear in the leaf
nodes and the connectives appear in the non-leaf
ones. The adoption of tree structure conforms to
traditional Chinese discourse theories and prac-
tice. For example, a native Chinese speaker
tends to determine the overall level boundary
first and then the analysis goes on step by step to
the individual clauses, when understanding a
complex sentence. This process naturally forms
a tree structure. Besides, tree structure is easier
to formalize, compared with graph.
More specifically, the hierarchical structure of
connectives indicates the hierarchical structure
of discourse units. Apparently, discourse struc-

<bodyText confidence="0.999990333333333">
ture analysis can be viewed as hierarchical anal-
ysis of connectives, with hierarchical connective
structure reflecting hierarchical combination of
discourse units. Essentially, the discourse hierar-
chy indicates the correlation degrees of semantic
relations in the discourse, the deeper tree level of
two discourse units, the higher correlation de-
gree of their semantic relation. Therefore, a dis-
course relation is the ultimate factor for the
choice of hierarchical discourse structure. For a
reference, please take Sentence 2 in Figure 2 as
an example.

3.4 Discourse Relation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990384746031746">
For discourse relation representation, a general
approach is to assign an abstract relation type to
a discourse relation directly, such as cause, con-
junction, condition, purpose, etc, as done in
RST-DT and PDTB. In our CDT scheme, we
avoid to directly assign an abstract relation type
to a discourse relation. Instead, we use the con-
nective itself to express the discourse relation, as
shown in Figure 2. In this way, the difficulty of
pre-defining a set of acknowledged discourse
relations and selecting an exact discourse rela-
tion can be avoided during the corpus annotation
process. Since a Chinese discourse relation is
largely controlled by connective (Xing, 2001),
the key to determine a relation is to identify a
suitable connective. Normally, most of relation
annotations can easily map from connectives to
abstract semantic classes of relations, if neces-
sary, with the help of the discourse context. The
majority of discourse relations in Chinese are
implicit, but it makes sense to insist on a con-
nective driven representation. With connective
as a bridge, at least it makes discourse represen-
tation easier.
For the abstraction of discourse relations, we
leave it in a later separate stage. Of course, there
are cases where a connective may represent
more than one discourse relation. For example,
connective “而” can denotes the continuous rela-
tion “而 (especially)” and the transitional rela-
tion “而 (however)”. Compared with annotating
discourse relation directly, annotator&apos;s intuition
is more accurate for specific connective. We
don&apos;t object to label discourse relation, referring
to the general work and Chinese analysis prac-
tice, give a set of relations (Figure 3), regarding
it as connective&apos;s semantics, and then annotate
the connective with it. In this way, we can obtain
a general relation set and resolve the connec-
tive&apos;s polysemy problem. We believe that the
connective itself is the foundation of discourse
relation, and the relation set can be adjusted dy-
namically according to the application require-
ments.
Figure 3 shows a three-level set of discourse
relations example. In the first level, this set con-
tains four relations of causality, coordination,
transition and explanation, which are further
clustered into 17 sub-relations in the second lev-
el. For example, relation causality contains 6
sub-relations, i.e. cause-result, inference, hypo-
thetical, purpose, condition and background. In
the third level, the connectives are under each
sub-relation. For example, cause-result relation
can be represented by “because”, &apos;therefore&apos; etc.
The numbers shown in the parentheses illustrate
the distributions of different relations in our cor-
pus. For example, there are 1335 causality rela-
tions in the first level, including 686 cause-result
relations, 38 inference relations, 70 hypothetical
relations, 335 purpose relations, 72 condition
relations and 134 background relations.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999725272727273">
Once discourse units are determined, adjacent
spans are linked together via connectives to
build a hierarchical structure. As stated above,
discourse relations may be either mononuclear
or multi-nuclear. A mononuclear relation holds
between a nucleus and a satellite unit. Normally,
the nucleus usually reflects the intention focus of
the discourse and is thus more salient in the dis-
course structure, while the satellite usually rep-
resents supportive information for the nucleus.

weight in the discourse structure.
For nucleus determination, we adopt the de-
pendency grammar, and select the unit which
can stand for the relationship with other dis-
course units in a discourse. As shown in Figure
2, on the first level, discourse relation “Xfk (to
this)” has the latter unit “ N 34,� ... fi- $q % M
(Pudong...as soon as they appear.)” as nucleus and
the former unit “N.�j....,ff p7&apos; (Pudong ...new
problem)” as satellite, since the latter unit agrees
with the main purpose of the discourse, which
emphasizes some methods for the progress of
Pudong. Moreover, since the combination of 4, 5
and 6 has the cause relation with 7, we choose 7
as nucleus because it can stand for the combina-
tion of 4, 5, 6 and 7, and has the selection rela-
tionship with 3.

4 Chinese Discourse Treebank
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999879">
Given above the CDT scheme, we choose 500
Xinhua newswire documents from the Chinese
Treebank (Xue et al., 2005b) in our Chinese
Discourse Treebank (CDTB) annotation. In par-
ticular, we annotate one discourse tree for each
paragraph.
In this section, we address the key issues with
the CDTB annotation, such as annotator training,
tagging strategies, corpus quality, along with the
statistics of the CDTB corpus.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998914">
4.1 Annotator Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947823529412">
The annotator team consists of a Ph.D. in Chi-
nese linguistics as the supervisor (senior annota-
tor) and four undergraduate students in Chinese
linguistics as annotators (two pairs). The annota-
tion is done in four phases. In the first phase, the
annotators spend 3 months on learning the prin-
ciples of CDT and the use of our developed dis-
course annotation tool. In the second phase, the
annotators spend 2 months on independently
annotating the same 50 documents (about 260
paraphrases), and another 2 months on cross-
checking to resolve the difference and to revise
the guidelines. In the third phase, the annotators
spend 9 months on annotating the remaining 450
documents. In the final phase, the supervisor
spends 3 months carefully proofread all 500
documents.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999444">
4.2 Tagging Strategies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950216216216">
In the CDTB annotation, we employ a top-down
strategy. That is, we determine the overall level
first and then the analysis goes on step by step to
the individual EDUs. This strategy is adopted in
our annotation tool. The advantages of the top-
down strategy are three folds. First, such a strat-
egy can easily grasp the whole discourse struc-
ture. This conforms to the global nature of dis-
course analysis. Second, due to the lack of clear
difference between Chinese sentence and phrase
structure, such a strategy can largely avoid the
error propagation in Chinese EDU segmentation.
Since in such a top-down strategy, EDU seg-
mentation becomes an end question, and even if
an EDU segmentation error happens, its impact
is localized, i.e. with little impact on the whole
discourse structure. Our annotation practice
shows that such strategy is effective. Third, such
a strategy accords with the cognitive of Chinese
characteristics, and conforms to the mental pro-
cess of Chinese discourse understanding (Huang
and Liao, 2011). However, we do not exclude
the bottom-up strategy. In some cases, on the
cognitive psychological process, annotator is
combine top-down and bottom-up strategies.
Take Example (3) as an example, an annotator
first finds the first level, with the period at the
end of sentence 1, and chooses discourse rela-
tion (either explicit or implicit), connective, and
connective related information (e.g. whether can
be added, deleted, and the language sense, etc.),
nuclearity etc. Then, the annotator turns to sen-
tence 1 and marks the second comma as level 2
with necessary information annotated, and goes
on to sentence 2, recursively, until all EDUs are
marked. In this way, a discourse tree with the
CDT representation is constructed.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999688">
4.3 Quality Assurance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99971425">
A number of steps are taken to ensure the quality
of CDTB. These involve two tasks: checking the
validity of the trees and tracking inter-annotator
consistency.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.740626">
4.3.1 Tree validation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987222222222">
We first manually check if a tree has a single
root node and compare the tree with the docu-
ment to check for missing sentence or fragments
from the end of text. Then we check the attached
information such as connectives, relations and
nuclearity in the tree. We also check the tree
with a tree traversal program to find the errors
undetected by the manual validation process.
Finally, all of the trees work successfully.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.874537">
4.3.2 Consistency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993617">
To ensure the quality of CDTB, we adopt the
inter-annotator consistency using Agreement
and kappa on 60 documents (chtb0041-chtb

0100). Table 1 illustrates the inter-annotator
consistency in details.
As shown in Table 1, we measure the agree-
ment of EDU segmentation by determining
whether punctuation (all period, comma etc. are
considered) is treated as an EDU boundary. It
shows that the agreement reaches 91.7% with
Cohen&apos;s kappa value (Cohen, 1960) 0.91. This
justifies the appropriateness of our EDU defini-
tion. Explicit or Implicit agreement 94.7% is
calculate by the same EDU boundary (intersec-
tion) of two annotators. For the same explicit
relation, the connective identification agreement
is 82.3%, because this is strict measure when
two annotators choose the same connective word.
If we relax the measure to contain the same
word, the agreement can reach 98%. For exam-
ple, one annotate “t...#(also...and)”, and the
other annotate “#(and)” is wrong with our strict
measure.

It is not surprising that the agreement on im-
plicit connective insertion with the same posi-
tion and the same connective only reaches
74.6% since for some discourse relations, there
may existing several connective alternatives. For
example, both “so” and “therefore” can express
the same causation relation. If we relax the con-
straint to the compatible connective, the agree-
ment on implicit connective insertion can reach
up to 84.5%.
Finally, it shows that the agreement on overall
discourse structure (with the same connectives
as non-leaf nodes, the same EDUs as leaf nodes)
reaches 77.4%. This justifies the appropriateness
of our CDT scheme, given the inherent ambigui-
ty in Chinese discourse structure.

4.4 Corpus Statistics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999855861111111">
Currently, the CDTB corpus consists of 500
newswire articles from Chinese Treebank, which
are further divided into 2342 paragraphs with a
CDT representation for one paragraph.
➢ For EDUs, CDTB contains 10650 EDUs with
an average of 4.5 EDUs per tree. On average,
there are 2 EDUs per sentence and 22 Chi-
nese characters per EDU.
➢ For discourse relations, CDTB contains 7310
relations, of which 1812 are explicit relations
(24.8%) and 5498 are implicit relations
(75.2%). This indicates that implicit relations
occur much more frequently in Chinese than
in English, e.g. 75.2% in CDTB (Chinese) vs.
~50% in PDTB (English).
➢ With the deepest level of 9, most (98.5%) of
discourse relations occur in level 1 (2342),
level 2(2372), level 3(1532), level 4(712),
and level 5(242). It also shows that 3557
(48.7%) relations are mononuclear relations
with 2110 nucleus ahead, while the remain-
ing 3754 relations are multi-nuclear. The
numbers shown in the parentheses of Figure
3 illustrate the distributions of different rela-
tions. In comparison with the top 2 most fre-
quently occurring relations in PDTB (Eng-
lish), i.e. the coordination and explanation re-
lations, there exist 3503 (47.9%) and 911 in-
stances respectively, with regard to the ab-
stract relation set as shown in Figure 3.
➢ CDTB contains 282 connectives, among
which 274 (140 can be deleted) appears as
explicit connectives and 44 can be inserted in
place of implicit connectives. Table 2 lists
the top 10 frequent explicit connectives and

In order to evaluate the computability of CDTB,
we give the experimental results on EDU recog-

which are certainly EDU boundaries, there re-
mains 7625 punctuations as EDU boundaries
(positive instances) and 4876 punctuations as
non-EDU boundaries (negative instances). With
various features as adopted in Xue and Yang

7 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972555555556">
In this paper, we propose a Connective-driven
Dependency Tree (CDT) structure as a represen-
tation scheme for Chinese discourse structure.
CDT takes advantage of both RST and PDTB,
and well adapts to the special characteristics of
Chinese discourse. In particular, we describe
CDT in detail from various perspectives, such as
EDU, connective, structure, relation and nucle-
arity. Given the CDT scheme, we annotate 500
documents in a top-down segmentation process
to keep consistent with Chinese native’s cogni-
tive habit. Evaluation of the CDTB corpus on
EDU recognition justifies the appropriateness of
the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse structure
and the usefulness of our CDTB corpus.
In the future work, we will focus on enlarging
the scale of the corpus annotation and develop-
ing a complete Chinese discourse parser.

In particular, connectives are employed to directly represent the hierarchy of the tree structure and the rhetorical relation of a discourse, while the nuclei of discourse units are globally determined with reference to the dependency theory. Guided by the CDT scheme, we manually annotate a Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) of 500 documents.

Section 5 compares CDTB with other major discourse corpora. Section 6 gives the experimental results on EDU recognition, the crucial step for discourse parsing. Finally, conclusion is given in section 7. 2 Related Work In the past decade, several discourse corpora for English have emerged, with the Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) (Carlson et al., 2003) and the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) most prevalent. In the RST framework, a text is represented as a discourse tree, with non-overlapping text spans (either phrases or clauses) as leaves, and adjacent nodes are related through particular rhetorical relations to form a discourse sub-tree, which is then related to other adjacent nodes in the tree structure. According to RST, there are two types of discourse relations, mononuclear and multinuclear. Figure 1 shows an example of discourse tree representation, following the notational convention of RST.

Table 1 illustrates the inter-annotator consistency in details. As shown in Table 1, we measure the agreement of EDU segmentation by determining whether punctuation (all period, comma etc. are considered) is treated as an EDU boundary. It shows that the agreement reaches 91.7% with Cohen&apos;s kappa value (Cohen, 1960) 0.91. This justifies the appropriateness of our EDU definition. Explicit or Implicit agreement 94.7% is calculate by the same EDU boundary (intersection) of two annotators. For the same explicit relation, the connective identification agreement is 82.3%, because this is strict measure when two annotators choose the same connective word. If we relax the measure to contain the same word, the agreement can reach 98%. For example, one annotate “t...#(also...and)”, and the other annotate “#(and)” is wrong with our strict measure.

Meanwhile, the special characteristics of Chinese discourse structure are well addressed. First, it is difficult to define EDU in Chinese due to the frequent occurrence of the ellipsis of subjects, objects and predicates, and the lack of functional marks for EDU. Second, the connectives in Chinese omit much more frequently than those in English with about 82.0% vs. 54.5% in Zhou and Xue (2012). In Example (2), there are even no explicit connectives. Third, previous studies have shown the difference in classifying Chinese discourse relations from English (Xing, 2001; Huang and Liao, 2011). This suggests that the discourse relations defined for English (both RST and PDTB) are not readily suitable for Chinese. Finally, the nucleus of a Chinese discourse relation is normally not directly related to a particular relation type but should be dynamically determined from the global meaning of a discourse. Example (2): An example of discourse with 4 EDUs [ Q1&amp;quot;, 3T,n �)� A �-12 According to reports,Dongguan Customs total accept iLAL aH * A-: Pq-ff4; },]e1 [VL i4A company contract record 8400 plus class, than pilot rU M� ;q EFF,]e2 [ iLAL &amp;X ftff,]e3 before a slight increase, company res</context>

First, from the syntactic structure perspective, an EDU should contain at least one predicate and express at least one proposition. Second, from the functional perspective, an EDU should be related to other EDUs with some propositional function, i.e. not act as a grammatical element of other EDUs. Finally, from the morphological perspective, an EDU should be segmented by some punctuation, e.g. comma, semicolon and period. We use punctuation because there usually has a pause between clauses (EDUs), which can be shown in written commas, semicolons etc (Huang and Liao, 2011). Normally, it is easy to handle complex sentences and special sentence patterns (e.g. serial predicate sentences). For Example (4), A) is a single sentence with serial predicate; B) is complex sentence with two EDUs (clauses): Example (4): EDU examples A) He opened the door and went out. (single sentence, serial predicate, one EDU) B) 1 He opened the door, |2 and went out. (complex sentence, two EDUs) Take as example, there exist 7 EDUs in Example (3), each marked with a number in front.

Second, due to the lack of clear difference between Chinese sentence and phrase structure, such a strategy can largely avoid the error propagation in Chinese EDU segmentation. Since in such a top-down strategy, EDU segmentation becomes an end question, and even if an EDU segmentation error happens, its impact is localized, i.e. with little impact on the whole discourse structure. Our annotation practice shows that such strategy is effective. Third, such a strategy accords with the cognitive of Chinese characteristics, and conforms to the mental process of Chinese discourse understanding (Huang and Liao, 2011). However, we do not exclude the bottom-up strategy. In some cases, on the cognitive psychological process, annotator is combine top-down and bottom-up strategies. Take Example (3) as an example, an annotator first finds the first level, with the period at the end of sentence 1, and chooses discourse relation (either explicit or implicit), connective, and connective related information (e.g. whether can be added, deleted, and the language sense, etc.), nuclearity etc. Then, the annotator turns to sentence 1 and marks the second comma as level 2 with necessary information annotated, and goes on</context>

In principle, EDUs play a crucial role to discourse analysis. Since from bottom-up discourse combination, EDUs are the start of discourse analysis, while from top-down discourse segmentation, they are the end of discourse analysis. Unfortunately, since there lacks obvious distinction between Chinese sentence structure and phrase structure, it is rather difficult to define Chinese EDU (clause). Till now, there is still no widely accepted definition in the Chinese linguistics community (Wang, 2010). Inspired by Li et al. (2013a), we give the definition of Chinese EDU from three perspectives. First, from the syntactic structure perspective, an EDU should contain at least one predicate and express at least one proposition. Second, from the functional perspective, an EDU should be related to other EDUs with some propositional function, i.e. not act as a grammatical element of other EDUs.

The above characteristics pose special challenges on connective determination in Chinese language. According to the appearance of a connective or not, a discourse relation can be either explicit or implicit. Previous studies have shown the difficulty of implicit relation recognition in English due to the omission of connectives (Pitler et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009). This becomes even worse in Chinese since compared with the implicit ratio of 54.5% in English connectives, this ratio rises up to about 82% in Chinese (Zhou and Xue, 2012). It is worth noting that the majority of discourse relations in Chinese are implicit, so the insertion of a connective in an implicit position can significantly ease the understanding of the discourse.

Guided by the CDT scheme, we manually annotate a Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) of 500 documents. Preliminary evaluation justifies the appropriateness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse analysis and the usefulness of our manually annotated CDTB corpus. 1 Introduction It is well-known that interpretation of a text requires understanding of its rhetorical relation hierarchy since discourse units rarely exist in isolation. Such discourse structure is fundamental to many text-based applications, such as summarization (Marcu, 2000) and questionanswering (Verberne et al., 2007). Due to the wide and potential use of discourse structure, constructing discourse resources has been attracting more and more attention in recent years. In comparison with English, there are much fewer discourse resources for Chinese which largely restricts the researches in Chinese discourse analysis.

In comparison with English, there are much fewer discourse resources for Chinese which largely restricts the researches in Chinese discourse analysis. The general notion of discourse structure mainly consists of discourse unit, connective, structure, relation and nuclearity. However, previous studies on discourse failed to fully express these kinds of information. For example, the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) represents a discourse as a tree with phrases or clauses as elementary discourse units (EDUs). However, RST ignores the importance of connectives to a great extent. Figure 1 gives an example tree structure with four EDUs (e1-e4). In comparison, Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) adopts the predicate-argument view of discourse relation, with discourse connective as predicate and two text spans as its arguments.

Figure 1 shows an example of discourse tree representation, following the notational convention of RST. Among the four EDUs (e1- e4), e1 and e2 are connected by a mononuclear relation “attribution”, where e1 is the nucleus, the span (e1-e2) and the EDU e3 are further connected by a multi-nuclear relation “sameunit”, where they are equally salient. Annotated according to the RST framework, the RST-DT consists of 385 documents from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Besides, the original 24 discourse relations defined by Mann and Thompson (1988) are further divided into a set of 18 relation classes with 78 finer grained rhetorical relations in RST-DT. As the largest discourse corpus so far, the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) contains over one million words from WSJ. With EDUs limited to clauses, the PDTB adopts the predicate2106 argument view of discourse relations, with connective as predicate and two text spans as its arguments. Example (1) shows two annotation tokens for the connective “particularly if” and “so”.

However, RST ignores the importance of connectives to a great extent. Figure 1 gives an example tree structure with four EDUs (e1-e4). In comparison, Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) adopts the predicate-argument view of discourse relation, with discourse connective as predicate and two text spans as its arguments. Example (1) shows an explicit reason relation signaled by the discourse connective “particularly if” and an implicit result relation represented by the inserted discourse connective “so”, with Arg1 in italics and Arg2 in bold. However, as a connective and its arguments are determined in a local contextual window, it is normally difficult to deduce a complete discourse structure from such a connective-argument scheme. In this sense, the PDTB at best only provide</context>

In the RST framework, a text is represented as a discourse tree, with non-overlapping text spans (either phrases or clauses) as leaves, and adjacent nodes are related through particular rhetorical relations to form a discourse sub-tree, which is then related to other adjacent nodes in the tree structure. According to RST, there are two types of discourse relations, mononuclear and multinuclear. Figure 1 shows an example of discourse tree representation, following the notational convention of RST. Among the four EDUs (e1- e4), e1 and e2 are connected by a mononuclear relation “</context>

Guided by the CDT scheme, we manually annotate a Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) of 500 documents. Preliminary evaluation justifies the appropriateness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse analysis and the usefulness of our manually annotated CDTB corpus. 1 Introduction It is well-known that interpretation of a text requires understanding of its rhetorical relation hierarchy since discourse units rarely exist in isolation. Such discourse structure is fundamental to many text-based applications, such as summarization (Marcu, 2000) and questionanswering (Verberne et al., 2007). Due to the wide and potential use of discourse structure, constructing discourse resources has been attracting more and more attention in recent years. In comparison with English, there are much fewer discourse resources for Chinese which largely restricts the researches in Chinese discourse analysis. The general notion of discourse structure mainly consists of discourse unit, connective, structure, relation and nuclearity. However, previous studies on discourse failed to fully express these kinds of information. For example, the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) re</context>

In principle, EDUs play a crucial role to discourse analysis. Since from bottom-up discourse combination, EDUs are the start of discourse analysis, while from top-down discourse segmentation, they are the end of discourse analysis. Unfortunately, since there lacks obvious distinction between Chinese sentence structure and phrase structure, it is rather difficult to define Chinese EDU (clause). Till now, there is still no widely accepted definition in the Chinese linguistics community (Wang, 2010). Inspired by Li et al. (2013a), we give the definition of Chinese EDU from three perspectives. First, from the syntactic structure perspective, an EDU should contain at least one predicate and express at least one proposition. Second, from the functional perspective, an EDU should be related to other EDUs with some propositional function, i.e. not act as a grammatical element of other EDUs. Finally, from the morphological perspective, an EDU should be segmented by some punctuation, e.g. comma, semicolon and period. We use punctuation because there usually has a pause between clauses (EDUs), w</context>

In particular, we annotate one discourse tree for each paragraph. In this section, we address the key issues with the CDTB annotation, such as annotator training, tagging strategies, corpus quality, along with the statistics of the CDTB corpus. 4.1 Annotator Training The annotator team consists of a Ph.D. in Chinese linguistics as the supervisor (senior annotator) and four undergraduate students in Chinese linguistics as annotators (two pairs).

In this paper, we attempt to propose a new scheme to Chinese discourse structure, adopt advantages of the tree structure from RST and connective from PDTB. Meanwhile, the special characteristics of Chinese discourse structure are well addressed. First, it is difficult to define EDU in Chinese due to the frequent occurrence of the ellipsis of subjects, objects and predicates, and the lack of functional marks for EDU. Second, the connectives in Chinese omit much more frequently than those in English with about 82.0% vs. 54.5% in Zhou and Xue (2012). In Example (2), there are even no explicit connectives. Third, previous studies have shown the difference in classifying Chinese discourse relations from English (Xing, 2001; Huang and Liao, 2011). This suggests that the discourse relations defined for English (both RST and PDTB) are not readily suitable for Chinese. Finally, the nucleus of a Chinese discourse relation is normally not directly related to a particular relation type but should be dynamically determined from the global meaning of a discourse.

The above characteristics pose special challenges on connective determination in Chinese language. According to the appearance of a connective or not, a discourse relation can be either explicit or implicit. Previous studies have shown the difficulty of implicit relation recognition in English due to the omission of connectives (Pitler et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009). This becomes even worse in Chinese since compared with the implicit ratio of 54.5% in English connectives, this ratio rises up to about 82% in Chinese (Zhou and Xue, 2012). It is worth noting that the majority of discourse relations in Chinese are implicit, so the insertion of a connective in an implicit position can significantly ease the understanding of the discourse. That is, a connective driven representation scheme is still applicable to a discourse with implicit connectives. To help determine implicit relations, two special strategies are proposed. First, for each explicit connective, a decision is made whether or not it can be deleted without changing the rhetorical relation of a discourse. It should be emphasized that this constraint is largely semanti</context>

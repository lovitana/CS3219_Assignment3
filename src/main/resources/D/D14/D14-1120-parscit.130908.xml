<bodyText confidence="0.975923">
In this paper we first exploit cash-tags (“$” fol-
lowed by stocks’ ticker symbols) in Twitter to
build a stock network, where nodes are stocks
connected by edges when two stocks co-occur
frequently in tweets. We then employ a labeled
topic model to jointly model both the tweets and
the network structure to assign each node and
each edge a topic respectively. This Semantic
Stock Network (SSN) summarizes discussion
topics about stocks and stock relations. We fur-
ther show that social sentiment about stock
(node) topics and stock relationship (edge) topics
are predictive of each stock’s market. For predic-
tion, we propose to regress the topic-sentiment
time-series and the stock’s price time series. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate that topic senti-
ments from close neighbors are able to help im-
prove the prediction of a stock markedly.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999969422222223">
Existing research has shown the usefulness of
public sentiment in social media across a wide
range of applications. Several works showed so-
cial media as a promising tool for stock market
prediction (Bollen et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2012;
Si et al., 2013). However, the semantic relation-
ships between stocks have not yet been explored.
In this paper, we show that the latent semantic
relations among stocks and the associated social
sentiment can yield a better prediction model.
On Twitter, cash-tags (e.g., $aapl for Apple
Inc.) are used in a tweet to indicate that the tweet
talks about the stocks or some other related in-
formation about the companies. For example,
one tweet containing cash-tags: $aapl and $goog
(Google Inc.), is “$AAPL is loosing customers.
everybody is buying android phones! $GOOG”.
Such joint mentions directly reflect some kind of
latent relationship between the involved stocks,
which motivates us to exploit such information
for the stock prediction.
We propose a notion of Semantic Stock Net-
work (SSN) and use it to summarize the latent
semantics of stocks from social discussions. To
our knowledge, this is the first work that uses
cash-tags in Twitter for mining stock semantic
relations. Our stock network is constructed based
on the co-occurrences of cash-tags in tweets.
With the SSN, we employ a labeled topic model
to jointly model both the tweets and the network
structure to assign each node and each edge a
topic respectively. Then, a lexicon-based senti-
ment analysis method is used to compute a sen-
timent score for each node and each edge topic.
To predict each stock’s performance (i.e., the
up/down movement of the stock’s closing price),
we use the sentiment time-series over the SSN
and the price time series in a vector autoregres-
sion (VAR) framework.
We will show that the neighbor relationships in
SSN give very useful insights into the dynamics
of the stock market. Our experimental results
demonstrate that topic sentiments from close
neighbors of a stock can help improve the predic-
tion of the stock market markedly.

Topic modeling has been widely used in social
media. Various extensions of the traditional LDA
model (Blei et al., 2003) has been proposed for
modeling social media data (Wang et al., 2011,

dicted the topic popularity based on hash-tags on
Twitter in a classification framework.

Financial network models study the correlations
of stocks in a graph-based view (Tse et al., 2010;
Mantegna, 1999; Vandewalle et al., 2001; On-
nela et al., 2003; Bonanno et al., 2001). The usu-
al approach is to measure the pairwise correla-
tion of stocks’ historical price series and then
connect the stocks based on correlation strengths
to build a correlation stock network (CSN).
However, our approach leverages social media
posts on stock tickers. The rationale behind is
that micro-blogging activities have been shown
to be highly correlated with the stock market
(Ruiz et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2012). It is more
informative, granular to incorporate latest devel-
opments of the market as reflected in social me-
dia instead of relying on stocks’ historical price.

Figure 2 illustrates our annotation for each tweet.
For a tweet, 𝑑 with three cash-tags: {𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣3},
we annotate ݀ with the label set, 𝐿𝑑 =
{𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣3, 𝑒1,2, 𝑒1,3, 𝑒2,3}. (𝑒1,2 is “aapl_goog”
if 𝑣1is “aapl” and 𝑣2 is “goog”). Then, the topic
assignments of words in 𝑑 are constrained to top-
ics indexed by its label set, 𝐿𝑑. Given the annota-
tions as labels, we use the Labeled LDA model
(Ramage et al., 2009) to jointly learn the topics
over nodes and edges. Labeled-LDA assumes
that the set of topics are the distinct labels in a
labeled set of documents, and each label corre-
sponds to a unique topic. Similar to LDA (Blei et
al., 2003), Labeled-LDA models each document
as an admixture of latent topics and generates
each word from a chosen topic. Moreover, La-
beled-LDA incorporates supervision by simply
constraining the model to use only those topics
that correspond to a document’s observed label
set (Ramage et al., 2009). For model inference,
we use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Bishop, 2006)
and the symmetric Dirichlet Priors are set to:
𝜂 = 0.01, 𝛼 = 0.01 as suggested in (Ramage et
al., 2010). The Gibbs Sampler is given as:

where 𝑁(𝑑𝑖, 𝑘) is the number of words in 𝑑𝑖 as-

con contributed by Hu and Liu (2004).
Considering the inherent dynamics of both the
stock markets and social sentiment, we organize
the tweets into daily based sub-sets according to
their timestamps to construct one 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 ( 𝑡 ∈
[1, 𝑇]) for each day. Then, we apply a Labeled
LDA for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 and compute the sentiment
scores for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡’s nodes and edges. This
yields a sentiment time series for the node, 𝑣,
{𝑆(𝑣)1, 𝑆(𝑣)2, ... , 𝑆(𝑣)𝑇} and for the edge, 𝑒𝑢,𝑣,
{𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)1,𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)2, ... , 𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)𝑇} . We intro-
duce a vector autoregression model (VAR)
(Shumway and Stoffer, 2011) by regressing sen-
timent time series together with the stock price
time series to predict the up/down movement of
the stock’s daily closing price.
As usual in time series analysis, the regression
parameters are learned during a training phase
and then are used for forecasting under sliding
windows, i.e., to train in period [𝑡, 𝑡 + 𝑤] and to
predict on time 𝑡 + 𝑤 + 1. Here the window size
𝑤 refers to the number of days in series used in
model training. A VAR model for two variables
{𝑥𝑡} and {𝑦𝑡} can be written as:

where {𝜀} are white noises, {𝜗} are model pa-
rameters, and lag notes the time steps of histori-
cal information to use. In our experiment, {𝑦𝑡} is
the target stock’s price time series, {𝑥𝑡} is the
covariate sentiment/price time series, and we will
try lag E {2,3}. We use the “dse” library in R
language to fit our VAR model based on least

with the stock market. Figure 3 shows us how the
Twitter activities response to a report announce-
ment of $aapl (Jan. 23 2013). The report was
made public soon after the market closed at
4:00pm, while the tweets volume rose about two
hours earlier and reached the peak at the time of

By further accumulating all days’ tweet volume
in our dataset as hourly based statistics, we plot
the volume distribution in Figure 4. Again, we
note that trading activities are well reflected by
tweet activities. The volume starts to rise drasti-

and then reaches a peak at 9:00pm. It drops dur-
ing the lunch time and reaches the second peak
around 2:00pm (after lunch). Above observations
clearly show that market dynamics are discussed
in tweets and the content in tweets’ discussion
very well reflects the fine-grained aspects of
stock market trading, opening and closing.

This section demonstrates the effectiveness of
our SSN based approach for stock prediction.
We leverage the sentiment time-series on two
kinds of topics from SSN: 1). Node topic from
the target stock itself, 2). Neighbor node/edge
topics. We note that the price correlation stock
network (CSN) (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2001; Man-
tegna, 1999) also defines neighbor relationships
based on the Pearson&apos;s correlation coefficient
(Tse et al., 2010) between pair of past price se-
ries (We get the stock dataset from Yahoo! Fi-
nance, between Nov. 2 2012 and Apr. 3 2013).
We build a two variables VAR model to pre-
dict the movement of a stock’s daily closing
price. One variable is the price time series of the
target stock ({yj in Eq.5); another is the covari-
ate sentiment/price time series ({xt} in Eq.5).
We setup two baselines according to the sources
of the covariate time series as follows:

ferent training window sizes of [15, 60] and lags.
{S(aapl), S(goog), S(msft), S(aapl_goog)} are
from SSN, P(dell) is from CSN ($dell (Dell
Inc.) takes the maximum price correlation score
of 0.92 with $aapl), and P* = P(aapl) is the
univariate AR model, using the target stock’s
price time series only. Table 2 further summariz-
es the performance comparison of different ap-
proaches reporting the average (and best) predic-
tion accuracies over all time windows and dif-
ferent lag settings. Comparing to the univariate
AR model (P* only), we see that the sentiment
based time-series improve performances signifi-
cantly. Among SSN sentiment based approach-
es, the S(goog) helps improve the performance
mostly and gets the best accuracy of 0.78 on lag
2 and training window size of 53. On average,
S(goog) achieves a net gain over S(aapl) in the
range of 29% with lag 2 (0.62 = 1.29 x 0.48) and
14% with lag 3 (0.57 = 1.14 x 0.50). Also,
S(aapl_goog) performs better than S(aapl) .
The result indicates that $aapl’s stock perfor-
mance is highly influenced by its competitor.
P(dell) also performs well, but we will see rela-
tionships from CSN may not be so reliable.
We further summarize some other prediction
cases in Table 3 to show how different covariate
sentiment sources ( S(. ) ) and price sources
(P(.)) from their closest neighbor nodes help
predict their stocks, which gives consistent con-
clusions. We compute the t-test for SSN based
prediction accuracies against that of CSN or

<listItem confidence="0.69790804">
1. CSN may find some correlated stock pairs
like $ebay and $amzn, $wmt and $tgt, but some-
times, it also produces pairs without real-world
relationships like $tgt and $vz, $qcom and $pfe,
etc. In contrast, SSN is built on large statistics of
human recognition in social media, which is like-
ly to be more reliable as shown.
2. Sentiment based approaches {S(•)} consist-
ently perform better than all price based ones
{P*, P(•)}. For S(•) based predictions, senti-
ment discovered from the target stock’s closest
neighbors in SSN performs best in general. This
empirical finding dovetails with qualitative re-
sults in the financial analysis community (Mizik
&amp; Jacobson, 2003; Porter, 2008), where compa-
nies’ market performances are more likely to be
influenced by their competitors. But for Google,
its stock market is not so much influenced by
other companies (it gets the best prediction accu-
racy on S(goog), i.e., the internal factor). It can
be explained by Google Inc.’s relatively stable
revenue structure, which is well supported by its
leading position in the search engine market.
3. The business of offline companies like Target

Although competition exists between $tag and
$wmt, their performances seem to be affected
more by a third-party like $amzn (In Table 3,
S(amzn) predicts the best for both). Not surpris-
ingly, these offline companies have already been
trying to establish their own online stores and

This paper proposed to build a stock network

The properties of SSN reveal some close rela-

that SSN is more robust than CSN in capturing
the neighbor relationships, and topic sentiments
from close neighbors of a stock significantly im-

<abstract confidence="0.999105315789474">In this paper we first exploit cash-tags (“$” followed by stocks’ ticker symbols) in Twitter to build a stock network, where nodes are stocks connected by edges when two stocks co-occur frequently in tweets. We then employ a labeled topic model to jointly model both the tweets and the network structure to assign each node and each edge a topic respectively. This Semantic Stock Network (SSN) summarizes discussion topics about stocks and stock relations. We further show that social sentiment about stock (node) topics and stock relationship (edge) topics are predictive of each stock’s market. For prediction, we propose to regress the topic-sentiment time-series and the stock’s price time series. Experimental results demonstrate that topic sentiments from close neighbors are able to help improve the prediction of a stock markedly.</abstract>

Experimental results demonstrate that topic sentiments from close neighbors are able to help improve the prediction of a stock markedly. 1 Introduction Existing research has shown the usefulness of public sentiment in social media across a wide range of applications. Several works showed social media as a promising tool for stock market prediction (Bollen et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2012; Si et al., 2013). However, the semantic relationships between stocks have not yet been explored. In this paper, we show that the latent semantic relations among stocks and the associated social sentiment can yield a better prediction model. On Twitter, cash-tags (e.g., $aapl for Apple Inc.) are used in a tweet to indicate that the tweet talks about the stocks or some other related information about the companies. For example, one tweet containing cash-tags: $aapl and $goog (Google Inc.), is “$AAPL is loosing customers. everybody is buying android phones! $GOOG”. Such joint</context>

The usual approach is to measure the pairwise correlation of stocks’ historical price series and then connect the stocks based on correlation strengths to build a correlation stock network (CSN). However, our approach leverages social media posts on stock tickers. The rationale behind is that micro-blogging activities have been shown to be highly correlated with the stock market (Ruiz et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2012). It is more informative, granular to incorporate latest developments of the market as reflected in social media instead of relying on stocks’ historical price. 3 Semantic Stock I</context>

We leverage the sentiment time-series on two kinds of topics from SSN: 1). Node topic from the target stock itself, 2). Neighbor node/edge topics. We note that the price correlation stock network (CSN) (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2001; Mantegna, 1999) also defines neighbor relationships based on the Pearson&apos;s correlation coefficient (Tse et al., 2010) between pair of past price series (We get the stock dataset from Yahoo! Finance, between Nov. 2 2012 and Apr. 3 2013). We build a two variables VAR model to predict the movement of a stock’s daily closing price. One variable is the price time series of the target stock ({yj in Eq.5); another is the covariate sentiment/price time series ({xt} in Eq.5). We setup two baselines according to the sources of the covariate time series as follows: 1. Covariate price time series from C</context>

Based on an opinion lexicon 𝑂, 𝑙(𝑤) = +1 if 𝑤 ∈ 𝑂𝑝𝑜𝑠, 𝑙 (𝑤) = -1 if 𝑤 ∈ 𝑂𝑛𝑒𝑔 and 𝑙 (𝑤) = 0 otherwise. We use the opinion English lexicon contributed by Hu and Liu (2004). Considering the inherent dynamics of both the stock markets and social sentiment, we organize the tweets into daily based sub-sets according to their timestamps to construct one 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 ( 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑇]) for each day. Then, we apply a Labeled LDA for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 and compute the sentiment scores for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡’s nodes and edges. This yields a sentiment time series for the node, 𝑣, {𝑆(𝑣)1, 𝑆(𝑣)2, ... , 𝑆(𝑣)𝑇} and for the edge, 𝑒𝑢,𝑣, {𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)1,𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)2, ... , 𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)𝑇} .

We leverage the sentiment time-series on two kinds of topics from SSN: 1). Node topic from the target stock itself, 2). Neighbor node/edge topics. We note that the price correlation stock network (CSN) (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2001; Mantegna, 1999) also defines neighbor relationships based on the Pearson&apos;s correlation coefficient (Tse et al., 2010) between pair of past price series (We get the stock dataset from Yahoo! Finance, between Nov. 2 2012 and Apr. 3 2013). We build a two variables VAR model to predict the movement of a stock’s daily closing price. One variable is the price time series of the target stock ({yj in Eq.5); another is the covariate sentiment/price time series ({xt} in Eq.5). We setup two baselines according to the sources of the covariate time series as follows: 1. Covariate price time series from CSN, we try the pr</context>

Sentiment based approaches {S(•)} consistently perform better than all price based ones {P*, P(•)}. For S(•) based predictions, sentiment discovered from the target stock’s closest neighbors in SSN performs best in general. This empirical finding dovetails with qualitative results in the financial analysis community (Mizik &amp; Jacobson, 2003; Porter, 2008), where companies’ market performances are more likely to be influenced by their competitors. But for Google, its stock market is not so much influenced by other companies (it gets the best prediction accuracy on S(goog), i.e., the internal factor). It can be explained by Google Inc.’s relatively stable revenue structure, which is well supported by its leading position in the search engine market. 3.

Sentiment based approaches {S(•)} consistently perform better than all price based ones {P*, P(•)}. For S(•) based predictions, sentiment discovered from the target stock’s closest neighbors in SSN performs best in general. This empirical finding dovetails with qualitative results in the financial analysis community (Mizik &amp; Jacobson, 2003; Porter, 2008), where companies’ market performances are more likely to be influenced by their competitors. But for Google, its stock market is not so much influenced by other companies (it gets the best prediction accuracy on S(goog), i.e., the internal factor). It can be explained by Google Inc.’s relatively stable revenue structure, which is well supported by its leading position in the search engine market. 3. The business of offline companies like Target Corp. ($tgt) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ($wmt) are highly affected by online companies like $amzn.

The usual approach is to measure the pairwise correlation of stocks’ historical price series and then connect the stocks based on correlation strengths to build a correlation stock network (CSN). However, our approach leverages social media posts on stock tickers. The rationale behind is that micro-blogging activities have been shown to be highly correlated with the stock market (Ruiz et al., 2012; Mao et al., 2012). It is more informative, granular to incorporate latest developments of the market as reflected in social media instead of relying on stocks’ historical price. 3 Semantic Stock Ietwork (SSI) 3.1 Construction of SSI We collected five months (Nov. 2 2012 - Apr. 3 2013) of English tweets for a set of stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s 100 list via Twitter’s REST API, using cash-tags as query keywords.

Considering the inherent dynamics of both the stock markets and social sentiment, we organize the tweets into daily based sub-sets according to their timestamps to construct one 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 ( 𝑡 ∈ [1, 𝑇]) for each day. Then, we apply a Labeled LDA for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡 and compute the sentiment scores for each 𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑡’s nodes and edges. This yields a sentiment time series for the node, 𝑣, {𝑆(𝑣)1, 𝑆(𝑣)2, ... , 𝑆(𝑣)𝑇} and for the edge, 𝑒𝑢,𝑣, {𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)1,𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)2, ... , 𝑆(𝑒𝑢,𝑣)𝑇} . We introduce a vector autoregression model (VAR) (Shumway and Stoffer, 2011) by regressing sentiment time series together with the stock price time series to predict the up/down movement of the stock’s daily closing price. As usual in time series analysis, the regression parameters are learned during a training phase and then are used for forecasting under sliding windows, i.e., to train in period [𝑡, 𝑡 + 𝑤] and to predict on time 𝑡 + 𝑤 + 1. Here the window size 𝑤 refers to the number of days in series used in model training. A VAR model for two variables {𝑥𝑡} and {𝑦𝑡} can be written as: 𝑦𝑡 — = ∑𝑖𝑎9 (V 𝑖 𝑥𝑡−𝑖 + V𝑖𝑦𝑦𝑡−𝑖) + 𝜀𝑡 (5) where {𝜀} are white noises, {𝜗} are mod</context>

We note that the price correlation stock network (CSN) (e.g., Bonanno et al., 2001; Mantegna, 1999) also defines neighbor relationships based on the Pearson&apos;s correlation coefficient (Tse et al., 2010) between pair of past price series (We get the stock dataset from Yahoo! Finance, between Nov. 2 2012 and Apr. 3 2013). We build a two variables VAR model to predict the movement of a stock’s daily closing price.

The ability to learn from user interactions
can give systems access to unprecedented
amounts of knowledge. This is evident
in search engines, recommender systems,
and electronic commerce, and it can be
the key to solving other knowledge in-
tensive tasks. However, extracting the
knowledge conveyed by user interactions
is less straightforward than standard ma-
chine learning, since it requires learning
systems that explicitly account for human
decision making, human motivation, and
human abilities.
In this talk, I argue that the design space of
such interactive learning systems encom-
passes not only the machine learning algo-
rithm itself, but also the design of the inter-
action under an appropriate model of user
behavior. To this effect, the talk explores
how integrating microeconomic models of
human behavior into the learning process
leads to new interaction models and their
associated learning algorithms, leading to
systems that have provable guarantees and
that perform robustly in practice.

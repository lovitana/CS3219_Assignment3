The rise of “Big Data” analytics over unstruc-
tured text has led to renewed interest in infor-
mation extraction (IE). We surveyed the land-
scape of IE technologies and identified a major
disconnect between industry and academia:
while rule-based IE dominates the commercial
world, it is widely regarded as dead-end tech-
nology by the academia. We believe the dis-
connect stems from the way in which the two
communities measure the benefits and costs of
IE, as well as academia’s perception that rule-
based IE is devoid of research challenges. We
make a case for the importance of rule-based
IE to industry practitioners. We then lay out a
research agenda in advancing the state-of-the-
art in rule-based IE systems which we believe
has the potential to bridge the gap between
academic research and industry practice.

The recent growth of “Big Data” analytics over large
quantities of unstructured text has led to increased
interest in information extraction technologies from
both academia and industry (Mendel, 2013).
Most recent academic research in this area starts
from the assumption that statistical machine learn-
ing is the best approach to solving information ex-
traction problems. Figure 1 shows empirical ev-
idence of this trend drawn from a survey of re-
cent published research papers. We examined the
EMNLP, ACL, and NAACL conference proceedings
from 2003 through 2012 and identified 177 different
EMNLP research papers on the topic of entity ex-
traction. We then classified these papers into three
categories, based on the techniques used: purely

is a classical IE task, and most industrial IE systems
offer this feature.

Only six papers relied solely on rules to perform the

that attitudes regarding the relative importance of the
different techniques have remained constant.

from pure machine learning systems was quite chal-
lenging. The papers that use a mixture of rule-
based and machine learning techniques were gener-
ally written so as to obfuscate the use of rules, em-
phasizing the machine learning aspect of the work.
Authors hid rules behind euphemisms such as “de-
pendency restrictions” (Mausam et al., 2012), “en-
tity type constraints” (Yao et al., 2011), or “seed dic-
tionaries” (Putthividhya and Hu, 2011).
In the commercial world, the situation is largely
reversed. The right side of Figure 1 shows the result
of a parallel survey of commercial entity extraction
products from 54 different vendors listed in (Yuen
and Koehler-Kruener, 2012). We studied analyst
reports and product literature, then classified each
product according to the same three categories. Ta-

year after the ten-year run of NLP papers we stud-
ied. One would expect the industrial landscape to
reflect the research efforts of the previous 10 years,
as mature technology moved from academia to in-
dustry. Instead, results of this second survey showed
the opposite effect, with rule-based systems com-
prising the largest fraction of those surveyed. Only
1/3 of the vendors relied entirely on machine learn-
ing. Among public companies and private compa-

2 Explaining the Disconnect
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878273972603">
What is the source of this disconnect between re-
search and industry? There does not appear to be
a lack of interaction between the two communities.
Indeed, many of the smaller companies we surveyed
were founded by NLP researchers, and many of the
larger vendors actively publish in the NLP literature.
We believe that the disconnect arises from a differ-
ence in how the two communities measure the costs
and benefits of information extraction.
Table 2 summarizes the pros and cons of machine
learning (ML) and rule-based IE technologies (Atz-
mueller and Kluegl, 2008; Grimes, 2011; Leung et
al., 2011; Feldman and Rosenfeld, 2006; Guo et
al., 2006; Krishnan et al., 2005; Yakushiji et al.,
2006; Kluegl et al., 2009). On the surface, both
academia and commercial vendors acknowledge es-
sentially the same pros and cons for the two ap-
proaches. However, the two communities weight the
pros and cons significantly differently, leading to the
drastic disconnect in Figure 1.
Evaluating the benefits of IE. Academic papers
evaluate IE performance in terms of precision and
recall over standard labeled data sets. This simple,
clean, and objective measure is useful for judging
competitions, but the reality of the business world is
much more fluid and less well-defined.
In a business context, definitions of even basic en-
tities like “product” and “revenue” vary widely from
one company to another. Within any of these ill-
defined categories, some entities are more important
to get right than others. For example, in electronic
legal discovery, correctly identifying names of ex-
ecutives is much more important than finding other
types of person names.
In real-world applications, the output of extrac-
tion is often the input to a larger process, and it
is the quality of the larger process that drives busi-
ness value. This quality may derive from an aspect
of extracted output that is only loosely correlated
with overall precision and recall. For example, does
extracted sentiment, when broken down and aggre-
gated by product, produce an unbiased estimate of
average sentiment polarity for each product?
To be useful in a business context, IE must func-
tion well with metrics that are ill-defined and sub-
ject to change. ML-based IE models, which require
a careful up-front definition of the IE task, are poor
fit for these metrics. The commercial world greatly
values rule-based IE for its interpretability, which
makes IE programs easier to adopt, understand, de-
bug, and maintain in the face of changing require-
ments (Kluegl et al., 2009; Atzmueller and Kluegl,
2008). Furthermore, rule-based IE programs are val-
ued for allowing one to easily incorporate domain
knowledge, which is essential for targeting specific
business problems (Grimes, 2011). As an example,
an application may pose simple requirements to its
entity recognition component to output only full per-
son names, and not include salutation. With a rule-
based system, such a requirement translates to re-
moving a few rules. On the other hand, a ML-based
approach requires a complete retrain.
Evaluating the costs of IE. In a business setting,
the most significant costs of using information ex-
traction are the labor cost of developing or adapting
extractors for a particular business problem, and the
hardware cost of compute resources required by the
system.
NLP researchers generally have a well-developed
sense of the labor cost of writing extraction rules,
viewing this task as a “tedious and time-consuming
process” that “is not really practical” (Yakushiji et
al., 2006). These criticisms are valid, and, as we

point out in the next section, they motivate a research
effort to build better languages and tools.
But there is a strong tendency in the NLP lit-
erature to ignore the complex and time-consuming
tasks inherent in solving an extraction problem using
machine learning. These tasks include: defining the
business problem to be solved in strict mathematical
terms; understanding the tradeoffs between different
types of models in the context of the NLP task def-
inition; performing feature engineering based on a
solid working understanding of the chosen model;
and gathering extensive labeled data — far more
than is needed to measure precision and recall —
often through clever automation.
All these steps are time-consuming; even highly-
qualified workers with postgraduate degrees rou-
tinely fail to execute them effectively. Not sur-
prisingly, in industry, ML-based systems are often
deemed risky to adopt and difficult to understand
and maintain, largely due to model opaqueness (Fry,
2011; Wagstaff, 2012; Malioutov and Varshney,
2013). The infeasibility of gathering labeled data in
many real-world scenarios further increases the risk
of committing to a ML-based solution.
A measure of the system’s scalability and run-
time efficiency, hardware costs are a function of two
metrics: throughput and memory footprint. These
figures, while extremely important for commercial
vendors, are typically not reported in NLP litera-
ture. Nevertheless, our experience in practice sug-
gests that ML-based approaches are much slower,
and require more memory compared to rule-based
approaches, whose throughput can be in the order
of MB/second/core for complex extraction tasks like
NER (Chiticariu et al., 2010).
The other explanation. Finally, we believe that the
most notable reason behind the academic commu-
nity’s steering away from rule-based IE systems is
the (false) perception of lack of research problems.
The general attitude is one of “What’s the research
in rule-based IE? Just go ahead and write the rules.”
as indicated by anecdotal evidence and only implic-
itly stated in the literature, where any usage of rules
is significantly underplayed as explained earlier. In
the next section, we strive to debunk this perception.

3 Bridging the Gap
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999882760869566">
As NLP researchers who also work regularly with
business customers, we have become increasingly
worried about the gap in perception between infor-
mation extraction research and industry. The recent
growth of Big Data analytics has turned IE into big
business (Mendel, 2013). If current trends continue,
the business world will move ahead with unprinci-
pled, ad-hoc solutions to customers’ business prob-
lems, while researchers pursue ever more complex
and impractical statistical approaches that become
increasingly irrelevant. Eventually, the gap between
research and practice will become insurmountable,
an outcome in neither community’s best interest.
The academic NLP community needs to stop
treating rule-based IE as a dead-end technology. As
discussed in Section 2, the domination of rule-based
IE systems in the industry is well-justified. Even in
their current form, with ad-hoc solutions built on
techniques from the early 1980’s, rule-based sys-
tems serve the industry needs better than the lat-
est ML techniques. Nonetheless, there is an enor-
mous untapped opportunity for researchers to make
the rule-based approach more principled, effective,
and efficient. In the remainder of this section, we
lay out a research agenda centered around captur-
ing this opportunity. Specifically, taking a systemic
approach to rule-based IE, one can identify a set of
research problems by separating rule development
and deployment. In particular, we believe research
should focus on: (a) data models and rule language,
(b) systems research in rule evaluation and (c) ma-
chine learning research for learning problems in this
richer target language.
Define standard IE rule language and data
model. If research on rule-based IE is to move
forward in a principled way, the community needs
a standard way to express rules. We believe that
the NLP community can replicate the success of
the SQL language in connecting data management
research and practice. SQL has been successful
largely due to: (1) expressivity: the language pro-
vides all primitives required for performing basic
manipulation of structured data, (2) extensibility: the
language can be extended with new features without
fundamental changes to the language, (3) declara-
tivity: the language allows the specification of com-

<bodyText confidence="0.999439767123288">
putation logic without describing its control flow,
thus allowing developers to code what the program
should accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it.
An earlier attempt in late 1980’s to formal-
ize a rule language resulted in the Common Pat-
tern Specification Language (CPSL) (Appelt and
Onyshkevych, 1998). While CPSL did not suc-
ceed due to multiple drawbacks, including expres-
sivity limitations, performance limitations, and its
lack of support for core operations such as part of
speech (Chiticariu et al., 2010), CPSL did gain some
traction, e.g., it powers the JAPE language of the
GATE open-source NLP system (Cunningham et al.,
2011). Meanwhile, a number of declarative IE lan-
guages developed in the database community, in-
cluding AQL (Chiticariu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011),
xLog (Shen et al., 2007), and SQL extensions (Wang
et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2009), have shown that for-
malisms of rule-based IE systems are possible, as
exemplified by (Fagin et al., 2013). However, they
largely remain unknown in the NLP community.
We believe now is the right time to establish a
standard IE rule language, drawing from existing
proposals and experience over the past 30 years. To-
wards this goal, IE researchers need to answer the
following questions: What is the right data model to
capture text, annotations over text, and their proper-
ties? Can we establish a standard declarative exten-
sible rule language for processing data in this model
with a clear set of constructs that is sufficiently ex-
pressive to solve most IE tasks encountered so far?
Systems research based on standard IE rule lan-
guage. Standard IE data model and language en-
ables the development of systems implementing the
standard. One may again wonder, “Where is the re-
search in that?” As in the database community, ini-
tial research should focus on systemic issues such
as data representation and speeding up rule evalua-
tion via automatic performance optimization. Once
baseline systems are established, system-related re-
search would naturally diverge in several directions,
such as extending the language with new primitives
(and corresponding optimizations), and exploring
modern hardware.
ML research based on standard IE rule language.
A standard rule language and corresponding execu-
tion engine enables researchers to use the standard
language as the expressivity of the output model,
and define learning problems for this target lan-
guage, including learning basic primitives such as
regular expressions and dictionaries, or complete
rule sets. (One need not worry about choosing the
language, nor runtime efficiency.) With an expres-
sive rule language, a major challenge is to prevent
the system from generating arbitrarily complex rule
sets, which would be difficult to understand or main-
tain. Some interesting research directions include
devising proper measures for rule complexity, con-
straining the search space such that the learnt rules
closely resemble those written by humans, active
learning techniques to cope with scarcity of labeled
data, and visualization tools to assist rule develop-
ers in exploring and choosing between different au-
tomatically generated rules. Finally, it is conceiv-
able that some problems will not fit in the target
language, and therefore will need alternative solu-
tions. However, the community would have shown
– objectively – that the problem is not learnable
with the available set of constructs, thus motivating
follow-on research on extending the standard with
new primitives, if possible, or developing novel hy-
brid IE solutions by leveraging the standard IE rule
language together with ML technology.

There does not appear to be a lack of interaction between the two communities. Indeed, many of the smaller companies we surveyed were founded by NLP researchers, and many of the larger vendors actively publish in the NLP literature. We believe that the disconnect arises from a difference in how the two communities measure the costs and benefits of information extraction. Table 2 summarizes the pros and cons of machine learning (ML) and rule-based IE technologies (Atzmueller and Kluegl, 2008; Grimes, 2011; Leung et al., 2011; Feldman and Rosenfeld, 2006; Guo et al., 2006; Krishnan et al., 2005; Yakushiji et al., 2006; Kluegl et al., 2009). On the surface, both academia and commercial vendors acknowledge essentially the same pros and cons for the two approaches. However, the two communities weight the pros and cons significantly differently, leading to the drastic disconnect in Figure 1. Evaluating the benefits of IE. Academic papers evaluate IE performance in terms of precision and recall over standard labeled data sets. This simple, clean, and objective measure is useful for jud</context>

For example, does extracted sentiment, when broken down and aggregated by product, produce an unbiased estimate of average sentiment polarity for each product? To be useful in a business context, IE must function well with metrics that are ill-defined and subject to change. ML-based IE models, which require a careful up-front definition of the IE task, are poor fit for these metrics. The commercial world greatly values rule-based IE for its interpretability, which makes IE programs easier to adopt, understand, debug, and maintain in the face of changing requirements (Kluegl et al., 2009; Atzmueller and Kluegl, 2008). Furthermore, rule-based IE programs are valued for allowing one to easily incorporate domain knowledge, which is essential for targeting specific business problems (Grimes, 2011). As an example, an application may pose simple requirements to its entity recognition component to output only full person names, and not include salutation. With a rulebased system, such a requirement translates to removing a few rules. On the other hand, a ML-based approach requires a complete retrain. Evaluating the costs of IE.

A measure of the system’s scalability and runtime efficiency, hardware costs are a function of two metrics: throughput and memory footprint. These figures, while extremely important for commercial vendors, are typically not reported in NLP literature. Nevertheless, our experience in practice suggests that ML-based approaches are much slower, and require more memory compared to rule-based approaches, whose throughput can be in the order of MB/second/core for complex extraction tasks like NER (Chiticariu et al., 2010). The other explanation. Finally, we believe that the most notable reason behind the academic community’s steering away from rule-based IE systems is the (false) perception of lack of research problems. The general attitude is one of “What’s the research in rule-based IE? Just go ahead and write the rules.” as indicated by anecdotal evidence and only implicitly stated in the literature, where any usage of rules is significantly underplayed as explained earlier. In the next section, we strive to debunk this perception. 3 Bridging the Gap As NLP researchers who also work regularly with business </context>

Not surprisingly, in industry, ML-based systems are often deemed risky to adopt and difficult to understand and maintain, largely due to model opaqueness (Fry, 2011; Wagstaff, 2012; Malioutov and Varshney, 2013).

There does not appear to be a lack of interaction between the two communities. Indeed, many of the smaller companies we surveyed were founded by NLP researchers, and many of the larger vendors actively publish in the NLP literature. We believe that the disconnect arises from a difference in how the two communities measure the costs and benefits of information extraction. Table 2 summarizes the pros and cons of machine learning (ML) and rule-based IE technologies (Atzmueller and Kluegl, 2008; Grimes, 2011; Leung et al., 2011; Feldman and Rosenfeld, 2006; Guo et al., 2006; Krishnan et al., 2005; Yakushiji et al., 2006; Kluegl et al., 2009). On the surface, both academia and commercial vendors acknowledge essentially the same pros and cons for the two approaches. However, the two communities weight the pros and cons significantly differently, leading to the drastic disconnect in Figure 1. Evaluating the benefits of IE. Academic papers evaluate IE performance in terms of precision and recall over standard labeled data sets. This simple, clean, and objective measure is useful for judging competitions, but the reality</context>

While CPSL did not succeed due to multiple drawbacks, including expressivity limitations, performance limitations, and its lack of support for core operations such as part of speech (Chiticariu et al., 2010), CPSL did gain some traction, e.g., it powers the JAPE language of the GATE open-source NLP system (Cunningham et al., 2011). Meanwhile, a number of declarative IE languages developed in the database community, including AQL (Chiticariu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011), xLog (Shen et al., 2007), and SQL extensions (Wang et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2009), have shown that formalisms of rule-based IE systems are possible, as exemplified by (Fagin et al., 2013). However, they largely remain unknown in the NLP community. We believe now is the right time to establish a standard IE rule language, drawing from existing proposals and experience over the past 30 years. Towards this goal, IE researchers need to answer the following questions: What is the right data model to capture text, annotations over text, and their properties? Can we establish a standard declarati</context>

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99829825">
Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in
sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical
models have been used for the task. However,
such models without any domain knowledge
often produce aspects that are not interpreta-
ble in applications. To tackle the issue, some
knowledge-based topic models have been
proposed, which allow the user to input some
prior domain knowledge to generate coherent
aspects. However, existing knowledge-based
topic models have several major shortcom-
ings, e.g., little work has been done to incor-
porate the cannot-link type of knowledge or
to automatically adjust the number of topics
based on domain knowledge. This paper pro-
poses a more advanced topic model, called
MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to ad-
dress these problems, which is based on an
Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU)
model (which is also proposed in this paper).
Experiments on real-life product reviews
from a variety of domains show that MC-
LDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
models markedly.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999701">
In sentiment analysis and opinion mining, aspect
extraction aims to extract entity aspects or features
on which opinions have been expressed (Hu and
Liu, 2004; Liu, 2012). For example, in a sentence
“The picture looks great,” the aspect is “picture.”
Aspect extraction consists of two sub-tasks: (1)
extracting all aspect terms (e.g., “picture”) from
the corpus, and (2) clustering aspect terms with
similar meanings (e.g., cluster “picture” and “pho-
to” into one aspect category as they mean the
same in the domain “Camera”). In this work, we
adopt the topic modeling approach as it can per-
form both sub-tasks simultaneously (see § 2).
Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003),
provide an unsupervised framework for extracting
latent topics in text documents. Topics are aspect
categories (or simply aspects) in our context.
However, in recent years, researchers have found
that fully unsupervised topic models may not pro-
duce topics that are very coherent for a particular
application. This is because the objective functions
of topic models do not always correlate well with
human judgments and needs (Chang et al., 2009).
To address the issue, several knowledge-based
topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA
model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates
two forms of prior knowledge, also called two
types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links.
A must-link states that two words (or terms)
should belong to the same topic whereas a cannot-
link indicates that two words should not be in the
same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more
general knowledge can be specified using first-
order logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et
al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu,
2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable
the user to specify prior knowledge as seed
words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010)
also used word similarity as priors for guidance.
However, none of the existing models is capable
of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge
except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Fur-
thermore, none of the existing models, including
DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the num-
ber of topics based on domain knowledge. The
domain knowledge, such as cannot-links, may
change the number of topics. There are two types
of cannot-links: consistent and inconsistent with
the domain corpus. For example, in the reviews of

domain “Computer”, a topic model may generate
two topics Battery and Screen that represent two
different aspects. A cannot-link {battery, screen}
as the domain knowledge is thus consistent with
the corpus. However, words Amazon and Price
may appear in the same topic due to their high co-
occurrences in the Amazon.com review corpus. To
separate them, a cannot-link {amazon, price} can
be added as the domain knowledge, which is in-
consistent with the corpus as these two words have
high co-occurrences in the corpus. In this case, the
number of topics needs to be increased by 1 since
the mixed topic has to be separated into two indi-
vidual topics Amazon and Price. Apart from the
above shortcoming, earlier knowledge-based topic
models also have some major shortcomings:
Incapability of handling multiple senses: A
word typically has multiple meanings or senses.
For example, light can mean “of little weight” or
“something that makes things visible.” DF-LDA
cannot handle multiple senses because its defini-
tion of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B
form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it
implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A,
B, and C should be in the same topic. This case
also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al.,
2011), (Petterson et al., 2010), and (Mukherjee and
Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et
al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that
each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed
set), which is restrictive as the amount of
knowledge should not be limited.
Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge:
When using must-links or seeds, existing models
basically try to ensure that the words in a must-
link or a seed set have similar probabilities under a
topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link com-
prises of a frequent word and an infrequent word,
due to the redistribution of probability mass, the
probability of the frequent word will decrease
while the probability of the infrequent word will
increase. This can harm the final topics because
the attenuation of the frequent (often domain im-
portant) words can result in some irrelevant words
being ranked higher (with higher probabilities).
To address the above shortcomings, we define
m-set (for must-set) as a set of words that should
belong to the same topic and c-set (cannot-set) as a
set of words that should not be in the same topic.
They are similar to must-link and cannot-link but
m-sets do not enforce transitivity. Transitivity is
the main cause of the inability to handle multiple
senses. Our m-sets and c-sets are also more con-
cise providing knowledge in the context of a set.
As in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), we assume that
there is no conflict between m-sets and c-sets, i.e.,
if w1 is a cannot-word of w2 (i.e., shares a c-set
with w2), any word that shares an m-set with w1 is
also a cannot-word of w2. Note that knowledge as
m-sets has also been used in (Chen et al., 2013a)
and (Chen et al., 2013b).
We then propose a new topic model, called MC-
LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), which is not on-
ly able to deal with c-sets and automatically adjust
the number of topics, but also deal with the multi-
ple senses and adverse effect of knowledge prob-
lems at the same time. For the issue of multiple
senses, a new latent variable s is added to LDA to
distinguish multiple senses (§ 3). Then, we employ
the generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model
(Mahmoud, 2008) to address the issue of adverse
effect of knowledge (§ 4). Deviating from the
standard topic modeling approaches, we propose
the Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU)
model (§ 5). E-GPU extends the GPU model to
enable multi-urn interactions. This is necessary for
handling c-sets and for adjusting the number of
topics. E-GPU is the heart of MC-LDA. Due to the
extension, a new inference mechanism is designed
for MC-LDA (§ 6). Note that E-GPU is generic
and can be used in any appropriate application.
In summary, this paper makes the following
three contributions:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998995736842105">
1. It proposed a new knowledge-based topic mod-
el called MC-LDA, which is able to use both
m-sets and c-sets, as well as automatically ad-
just the number of topics based on domain
knowledge. At the same time, it can deal with
some other major shortcomings of early exist-
ing models. To our knowledge, none of the ex-
isting knowledge-based models is as compre-
hensive as MC-LDA in terms of capabilities.
2. It proposed the E-GPU model to enable multi-
urn interactions, which enables c-sets to be nat-
urally integrated into a topic model. To the best
of our knowledge, E-GPU has not been pro-
posed and used before.
3. A comprehensive evaluation has been conduct-
ed to compare MC-LDA with several state-of-
the-art models. Experimental results based on
both qualitative and quantitative measures
demonstrate the superiority of MC-LDA.

recent years (Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee,

Other approaches include shallow semantic pars-
ing (Li et al., 2012b), bootstrapping (Xia et al.,
2009), Non-English techniques (Abu-Jbara et al.,
2013; Zhou et al., 2012), graph-based representa-
tion (Wu et al., 2011), convolution kernels
(Wiegand and Klakow, 2010) and domain adap-
tion (Li et al., 2012). Stoyanov and Cardie (2011),
Wang and Liu (2011), and Meng et al. (2012)
studied opinion summarization outside the reviews.
Some other works related with sentiment analysis
include (Agarwal and Sabharwal, 2012; Kennedy
and Inkpen, 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Mohammad et
al., 2009).
In this work, we focus on topic models owing to
their advantage of performing both aspect extrac-
tion and clustering simultaneously. All other ap-
proaches only perform extraction. Although there
are several related works on clustering aspect
terms (e.g., Carenini et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2009;
Zhai et al., 2011), they all assume that the aspect
terms have been extracted beforehand. We also
notice that some aspect extraction models in sen-
timent analysis separately discover aspect words
and aspect specific sentiment words (e.g., Sauper
and Barzilay, 2013; Zhao et al., 2010). Our pro-
posed model does not separate them as most sen-
timent words also imply aspects and most adjec-
tives modify specific attributes of objects. For ex-
ample, sentiment words expensive and beautiful
imply aspects price and appearance respectively.
Regarding the knowledge-based models, be-
sides those discussed in § 1, the model (Hu et al.,
2011) enables the user to provide guidance interac-
tively. Blei and McAuliffe (2007) and Ramage et
al. (2009) used document labels in supervised set-
ting. In (Chen et al., 2013a), we proposed MDK-
LDA to leverage multi-domain knowledge, which
serves as the basic mechanism to exploit m-sets in
MC-LDA. In (Chen et al., 2013b), we proposed a
framework (called GK-LDA) to explicitly deal
with the wrong knowledge when exploring the
lexical semantic relations as the general (domain
independent) knowledge in topic models. But
these models above did not consider the
knowledge in the form of c-sets (or cannot-links).
The generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model
(Mahmoud, 2008) was first introduced in LDA by
Mimno et al. (2011). However, Mimno et al. (2011)
did not use domain knowledge. Our results in § 7
show that using domain knowledge can signifi-
cantly improve aspect extraction. The GPU model
was also employed in topic models in our work of
(Chen et al., 2013a, 2013b). In this paper, we pro-
pose the Extended GPU (E-GPU) model. The E-
GPU model is more powerful in handling complex
situations in dealing with c-sets.

Since the proposed MC-LDA model is a major
extension to our earlier work in (Chen et al.,
2013a), which can deal with m-sets, we include
this earlier work here as the background.
To incorporate m-sets and deal with multiple
senses of a word, the MDK-LDA(b) model was
proposed in (Chen et al., 2013a), which adds a
new latent variable s into LDA. The rationale here
is that this new latent variable s guides the model
to choose the right sense represented by an m-set.
The generative process of MDK-LDA(b) is (the

The Pólya urn model involves an urn containing
balls of different colors. At discrete time intervals,
balls are added or removed from the urn according
to their color distributions.
In the simple Pólya urn (SPU) model, a ball is
first drawn randomly from the urn and its color is
recorded, then that ball is put back along with a
new ball of the same color. This selection process
is repeated and the contents of the urn change over
time, with a self-reinforcing property sometimes
expressed as “the rich get richer.” SPU is actually
exhibited in the Gibbs sampling for LDA.
The generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model differs
from the SPU model in the replacement scheme
during sampling. Specifically, when a ball is ran-
domly drawn, certain numbers of additional balls
of each color are returned to the urn, rather than
just two balls of the same color as in SPU.

To deal with the issue of sensitivity to the adverse
effect of knowledge, MDK-LDA(b) is extended to
MDK-LDA which employs the generalized Pólya
urn (GPU) sampling scheme.
As discussed in § 1, due to the problem of the
adverse effect of knowledge, important words may
suffer from the presence of rare words in the same
m-set. This problem can be dealt with the very
sampling scheme of the GPU model (Chen et al.,
2013a). Specifically, by adding additional 𝔸𝑠,𝑤′,𝑤
balls of color 𝑠 into 𝑈𝑡𝑆 while keeping the drawn
ball, we increase the proportion (probability) of
seeing the m-set 𝑠 under topic 𝑡 and thus promote
m-set 𝑠 as a whole. Consequently, each word in 𝑠
is more likely to be emitted. We define 𝔸𝑠,𝑤′,𝑤 as:

5.1 Extended Generalized Pólya urn Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968956071428572">
To handle the complex situation resulted from in-
corporating c-sets, we propose an Extended gener-
alized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model. Instead of
involving only one urn as in SPU and GPU, E-
GPU model considers a set of urns in the sampling
process. The E-GPU model allows a ball to be
transferred from one urn to another, enabling mul-
ti-urn interactions. Thus, during sampling, the
populations of several urns will evolve even if on-
ly one ball is drawn from one urn. This capability
makes the E-GPU model more powerful as it
models relationships among multiple urns.
We define three sets of urns which will be used
in the new sampling scheme in the proposed MC-
LDA model. The first set of urns is the topic urns
𝑈𝑚∈{1...𝑀}
𝑇 , where each topic urn contains 𝑇 colors
(topics) and each ball inside has a color 𝑡 ∈
{1 ... 𝑇}. It corresponds to the document-topic dis-
tribution 𝜃 in Table 1. The second set of urns (m-
set urn 𝑈𝑡∈ {1...𝑇}
𝑆 ) corresponds to the topic-m-set
distribution 𝜑 , with balls of colors (m-sets)
𝑠 ∈ {1 ... 𝑆} in each m-set urn. The third set of
urns is the word urns 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑊,where 𝑡 ∈ {1... 𝑇} and
𝑠 ∈ {1 ...𝑆}. Each ball inside a word urn has a
color (word) 𝑤 ∈ {1 ... 𝑉}. The distribution 𝜂 can
be reflected in this set of urns.

5.2 Handling C-sets using E-GPU
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986333333333">
As MDK-LDA can only use m-sets but not c-sets,
we now extend MDK-LDA to the MC-LDA model
in order to exploit c-sets. As pointed out in § 1, c-
sets may be inconsistent with the corpus domain,
which makes them considerably harder to deal
with. To tackle the issue, we utilize the proposed
E-GPU model and incorporate c-sets handling in-
side the E-GPU sampling scheme, which is also
designed to enable automated adjustment of the
number of topics based on domain knowledge.
Based on the definition of c-set, each pair of
words in a c-set cannot both have large probabili-
ties under the same topic. As the E-GPU model
allows multi-urn interactions, when sampling a
ball represents word 𝑤 from a word urn 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑊, we
want to transfer the balls representing cannot-
words of 𝑤 (sharing a c-set with 𝑤) to other urns
(see Step 3 a below). That is, decrease the proba-
bilities of those cannot-words under this topic
while increasing their corresponding probabilities
under some other topics. In order to correctly
transfer a ball that represents word 𝑤, it should be
transferred to an urn which has a higher proportion
of 𝑤 and its related words (i.e., words sharing m-
sets with 𝑤). That is, we randomly sample an urn
that has a higher proportion of any m-set of 𝑤 to
transfer 𝑤 to (Step 3 b below). However, the situa-
tion becomes more involved when a c-set is not
consistent with the corpus. For example, aspects
price and amazon may be mixed under one topic
(say 𝑡) in LDA. The user may want to separate
them by providing a c-set {price, amazon}. In this
case, according to LDA, word price has no topic
with a higher proportion of it (and its related
words) than topic 𝑡. To transfer it, we need to in-
crement the number of topics by 1 and then trans-
fer the word to this new topic urn (step 3 c below).
Based on these ideas, we propose the E-GPU sam-
pling scheme for the MC-LDA model below:

<listItem confidence="0.95609575">
1. Sample a topic 𝑡 from 𝑈𝑚𝑇 , an m-set 𝑠 from 𝑈𝑡𝑆 , and

to urn 𝑈𝑚𝑇, one ball of color 𝑠 into urn 𝑈𝑡𝑆, and two
balls of color 𝑤 into urn 𝑈𝑡,𝑠𝑊. Given the matrix 𝔸

𝔸𝑠,𝑤′,𝑤 number of balls of color 𝑠 into urn 𝑈𝑡𝑆 .

We now describe the collapsed Gibbs sampler
(Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) with the detailed
conditional distributions and algorithms for MC-
LDA. Inference of 𝑧 and 𝑠 can be computationally
expensive due to the non-exchangeability of words
under the E-GPU models. We take the approach of
(Mimno et al., 2011) which approximates the true
Gibbs sampling distribution by treating each word
as if it were the last.
For each word 𝑤𝑖 , we perform hierarchical
sampling consisting of the following three steps
(the detailed algorithms are given in Figures 2 and
3):
Step 1 (Lines 1-11 in Figure 2): We jointly
sample a topic 𝑧𝑖 and an m-set 𝑠𝑖 (containing 𝑤𝑖)
for 𝑤𝑖, which gives us a blocked Gibbs sampler
(Ishwaran and James, 2001), with the conditional
probability given by:

Pre-processing: We ran the Stanford Core NLP
Tools1 to perform sentence detection and lemmati-
zation. Punctuations, stopwords 2 , numbers and
words appearing less than 5 times in each corpus
were removed. The domain name was also re-
moved, e.g., word camera in the domain “Camera”,
since it co-occurs with most words in the corpus,
leading to high similarity among topics/aspects.
Sentences as documents: As noted in (Titov and
McDonald, 2008), when standard topic models are
applied to reviews as documents, they tend to pro-
duce topics that correspond to global properties of
products (e.g., brand name), which make topics
overlapping with each other. The reason is that all
reviews of the same type of products discuss about
the same aspects of these products. Only the brand
names and product names are different. Thus, us-
ing individual reviews for modeling is not very
effective. Although there are approaches which
model sentences (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and
McDonald, 2008), we take the approach of (Brody
and Elhadad, 2010), dividing each review into sen-
tences and treating each sentence as an independ-
ent document. Sentences can be used by all three
baselines without any change to their models. Alt-
hough the relationships between sentences are lost,
the data is fair to all models.
Parameter settings: For all models, posterior in-
ference was drawn using 1000 Gibbs iterations
with an initial burn-in of 100 iterations. For all
models, we set a = 1 and fl = 0.1. We found that
small changes of a and fl did not affect the results
much, which was also reported in (Jo and Oh,
2011) who also used online reviews. For the num-
ber of topics T, we tried different values (see §7.2)
as it is hard to know the exact number of topics.
While non-parametric Bayesian approaches (Teh
et al., 2006) aim to estimate T from the corpus,
they are often sensitive to the hyper-parameters
(Heinrich, 2009).

For DF-LDA, we followed (Andrzejewski et al.,
2009) to generate must-links and cannot-links
from our domain knowledge. We then ran DF-
LDA3 while keeping its parameters as proposed in
(Andrzejewski et al., 2009) (we also experimented
with different parameter settings but they did not
produce better results). For our proposed model,
we estimated the thresholds using cross validation
in our pilot experiments. Estimated value 𝜎 = 0.2
in equation 3 yielded good results. The second
stage (steps 2 and 3) of the Gibbs sampler for MC-
LDA (for dealing with c-sets) is applied after
burn-in phrase.
Domain knowledge: User knowledge about a do-
main can vary a great deal. Different users may
have very different knowledge. To reduce this var-
iance for a more reliable evaluation, instead of
asking a human user to provide m-sets, we obtain
the synonym sets and the antonym sets of each
word that is a noun or adjective (as words of other
parts-of-speech usually do not indicate aspects)
from WordNet (Miller, 1995) and manually verify
the words in those sets for the domain. Note that if
a word 𝑤 is not provided with any m-set, it is
treated as a singleton m-set {𝑤}. For c-sets, we ran
LDA in each domain and provide c-sets based on
the wrong results of LDA as in (Andrzejewski et
al., 2009). Then, the knowledge is provided to
each model in the format required by each model.
The numbers of m-sets and c-sets are listed in col-
umns 4 and 5 of Table 2. Duplicate sets have been
removed.

LDA model objectively. Topic models are often
evaluated using perplexity on held-out test data.
However, the perplexity metric does not reflect the
semantic coherence of individual topics learned by
a topic model (Newman et al., 2010). Recent re-
search has shown potential issues with perplexity
as a measure: (Chang et al., 2009) suggested that
the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human
judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect
our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate
semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of
how well the model fits the data.
The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al.,
2011) (also called the “UMass” measure (Stevens
and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alter-
native for assessing topic quality. This metric re-
lies upon word co-occurrence statistics within the
documents, and does not depend on external re-
sources or human labeling. It was shown that topic
coherence is highly consistent with human expert
labeling by Mimno et al. (2011). Higher topic co-
herence score indicates higher quality of topics,
i.e., better topic interpretability.

in § 1. It is slightly better than LDA when T =
15, but worse than LDA in other cases. We will
further analyze the effects of knowledge on
MC-LDA and DF-LDA shortly.
3. LDA-GPU does not perform well due to its use
of co-document frequency. As frequent words
usually have high co-document frequency with
many other words, the frequent words are
ranked top in many topics. This shows that the
guidance using domain knowledge is more ef-
fective than using co-document frequency.
In terms of improvements, MC-LDA outperforms
M-LDA significantly ( p &lt; 0.03 ) and all other
baseline models significantly (p &lt; 0.01) based on
a paired t-test. It is important to note that by no
means do we say that LDA-GPU and DF-LDA are
not effective. We only say that for the task of as-
pect extraction and leveraging domain knowledge,
these models do not generate as coherent aspects
as ours because of their shortcomings discussed in
§ 1. In general, with more topics, the Topic Coher-
ence scores increase. We found that when T is
larger than 15, aspects found by each model be-
came more and more overlapping, with several
aspects expressing the same features of products.
So we fix T = 15 in the subsequent experiments.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996522">
Effects of Knowledge
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973">
To further analyze the effects of knowledge on
models, in each domain, we randomly sampled
different proportions of knowledge (i.e., different
numbers of m-sets/must-links and c-sets/cannot-
links) as shown in Figure 5, where 0% means no
knowledge (same as LDA and LDA-GPU, which
do not incorporate knowledge) and 100% means
all knowledge. From Figure 5, we see that MC-
LDA and M-LDA both perform consistently better
than DF-MC and DF-M across different propor-
tions of knowledge. With the increasing number of
knowledge sets, MC-LDA and M-LDA achieve
higher Topic Coherence scores (i.e., produce more
coherent aspects). In general, MC-LDA performs
the best. For both DF-MC and DF-M, the Topic
Coherence score increases from 0% to 25%
knowledge, but decreases with more knowledge
(50% and 100%). This shows that with limited
amount of knowledge, the shortcomings of DF-
LDA are not very obvious, but with more
knowledge, these issues become more serious and
thus degrade the performance of DF-LDA.

7.3 Human Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999821208333333">
Since our aim is to make topics more interpretable
and conformable to human judgments, we worked
with two judges who are familiar with Amazon
products and reviews to evaluate the models sub-
jectively. Since topics from topic models are rank-
ings based on word probability and we do not
know the number of correct topical words, a natu-
ral way to evaluate these rankings is to use Preci-
sion@n (or p@n) which was also used in
(Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010),
where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n =
5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation:
topic labeling and word labeling.
Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in
(Mimno et al., 2011) and asked the judges to label
each topic as good or bad. Each topic was present-
ed as a list of 10 most probable words in descend-
ing order of their probabilities under that topic.
The models which generated the topics for label-
ing were obscure to the judges. In general, each
topic was annotated as good if it had more than
half of its words coherently related to each other
representing a semantic concept together; other-
wise bad. Agreement of human judges on topic

labeling using Cohen’s Kappa yielded a score of
0.92 indicating almost perfect agreements accord-
ing to the scale in (Landis and Koch, 1977). This
is reasonable as topic labeling is an easy task and
semantic coherence can be judged well by humans.
Word Labeling: After topic labeling, we chose
the topics, which were labeled as good by both
judges, as good topics. Then, we asked the two
judges to label each word of the top 10 words in
these good topics. Each word was annotated as
correct if it was coherently related to the concept
represented by the topic; otherwise incorrect.
Since judges already had the conception of each
topic in mind when they were labeling topics, la-
beling each word was not difficult which explains
the high Kappa score for this labeling task (score =
0.892).

Coherence results in §7.2. MC-LDA improves
over M-LDA significantly (𝑝 &lt; 0.01) and both
MC-LDA and M-LDA outperforms the other base-
line models significantly ( 𝑝 &lt; 0.005 ) using a
paired t-test. We also found that when the domain
knowledge is simple with one word usually ex-
pressing only one meaning/sense (e.g., in the do-
main “Computer”), DF-LDA performs better than
LDA. In other domains, it performs similarly or
worse than LDA. Again, it shows that DF-LDA is
not effective to handle complex knowledge, which
is consistent with the results of effects of
knowledge on DF-LDA in §7.2.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999388125">
This paper proposed a new model to exploit do-
main knowledge in the form of m-sets and c-sets
to generate coherent aspects (topics) from online
reviews. The paper first identified and character-
ized some shortcomings of the existing
knowledge-based models. A new model called
MC-LDA was then proposed, whose sampling
scheme was based on the proposed Extended GPU
(E-GPU) model enabling multi-urn interactions. A
comprehensive evaluation using real-life online
reviews from multiple domains shows that MC-
LDA outperforms the state-of-the-art models sig-
nificantly and discovers aspects with high seman-
tic coherence. In our future work, we plan to
incorporate aspect specific sentiments in the MC-
LDA model.

<abstract confidence="0.99902084">Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an generalized Pólya urn model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MC- LDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</abstract>

Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), provide an unsupervised framework for extracting latent topics in text documents. Topics are aspect categories (or simply aspects) in our context. However, in recent years, researchers have found that fully unsupervised topic models may not produce topics that are very coherent for a particular application. This is because the objective functions of topic models do not always correlate well with human judgments and needs (Chang et al., 2009). To address the issue, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates two forms of prior knowledge, also called two types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. A must-link states that two words (or terms) should belong to the same topic whereas a cannotlink indicates that two words should not be in the same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more general knowledge can be specified using firstorder logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable the user to specify prior knowledge as seed words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010) also u</context>
<context position="6614" citStr="Andrzejewski et al., 2009" startWordPosition="1055" endWordPosition="1058">ttenuation of the frequent (often domain important) words can result in some irrelevant words being ranked higher (with higher probabilities). To address the above shortcomings, we define m-set (for must-set) as a set of words that should belong to the same topic and c-set (cannot-set) as a set of words that should not be in the same topic. They are similar to must-link and cannot-link but m-sets do not enforce transitivity. Transitivity is the main cause of the inability to handle multiple senses. Our m-sets and c-sets are also more concise providing knowledge in the context of a set. As in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), we assume that there is no conflict between m-sets and c-sets, i.e., if w1 is a cannot-word of w2 (i.e., shares a c-set with w2), any word that shares an m-set with w1 is also a cannot-word of w2. Note that knowledge as m-sets has also been used in (Chen et al., 2013a) and (Chen et al., 2013b). We then propose a new topic model, called MCLDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), which is not only able to deal with c-sets and automatically adjust the number of topics, but also deal with the multiple senses and adverse effect of knowledge problems at the same time. For the issue of multiple senses, a ne</context>

And then assign T to zb . The counts and parameters are also updated accordingly. 7 Experiments We now evaluate the proposed MC-LDA model and compare it with state-of-the-art existing models. Two unsupervised baseline models that we compare with are: • LDA: LDA is the basic unsupervised topic model (Blei et al., 2003). • LDA-GPU: LDA with GPU (Mimno et al., 2011). Specifically, LDA-GPU applies GPU in LDA using co-document frequency. As for knowledge-based models, we focus on comparing with DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), which is perhaps the best known knowledge-based model and it allows both mustlinks and cannot-links. For a comprehensive evaluation, we consider the following variations of MC-LDA and DF-LDA: • MC-LDA: MC-LDA with both m-sets and csets. This is the newly proposed model. • M-LDA: MC-LDA with m-sets only. This is the MDK-LDA model in (Chen et al., 2013a). • DF-M: DF-LDA with must-links only. • DF-MC: DF-LDA with both must-links and cannot-links. This is the full DF-LDA model in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). We do not compare with seeded models in (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; L</context>

To reduce this variance for a more reliable evaluation, instead of asking a human user to provide m-sets, we obtain the synonym sets and the antonym sets of each word that is a noun or adjective (as words of other parts-of-speech usually do not indicate aspects) from WordNet (Miller, 1995) and manually verify the words in those sets for the domain. Note that if a word 𝑤 is not provided with any m-set, it is treated as a singleton m-set {𝑤}. For c-sets, we ran LDA in each domain and provide c-sets based on the wrong results of LDA as in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Then, the knowledge is provided to each model in the format required by each model. The numbers of m-sets and c-sets are listed in columns 4 and 5 of Table 2.

This is because the objective functions of topic models do not always correlate well with human judgments and needs (Chang et al., 2009). To address the issue, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates two forms of prior knowledge, also called two types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. A must-link states that two words (or terms) should belong to the same topic whereas a cannotlink indicates that two words should not be in the same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more general knowledge can be specified using firstorder logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable the user to specify prior knowledge as seed words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010) also used word similarity as priors for guidance. However, none of the existing models is capable of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Furthermore, none of the existing models, including DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the number of topic</context>

Apart from the above shortcoming, earlier knowledge-based topic models also have some major shortcomings: Incapability of handling multiple senses: A word typically has multiple meanings or senses. For example, light can mean “of little weight” or “something that makes things visible.” DF-LDA cannot handle multiple senses because its definition of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A, B, and C should be in the same topic. This case also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), (Petterson et al., 2010), and (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed set), which is restrictive as the amount of knowledge should not be limited. Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge: When using must-links or seeds, existing models basically try to ensure that the words in a mustlink or a seed set have similar probabilities under a topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link comprises of a frequent word and an infrequent word, due to the redistribution o</context>

Our proposed model does not separate them as most sentiment words also imply aspects and most adjectives modify specific attributes of objects. For example, sentiment words expensive and beautiful imply aspects price and appearance respectively. Regarding the knowledge-based models, besides those discussed in § 1, the model (Hu et al., 2011) enables the user to provide guidance interactively. Blei and McAuliffe (2007) and Ramage et al. (2009) used document labels in supervised setting. In (Chen et al., 2013a), we proposed MDKLDA to leverage multi-domain knowledge, which serves as the basic mechanism to exploit m-sets in MC-LDA. In (Chen et al., 2013b), we proposed a framework (called GK-LDA) to explicitly deal with the wrong knowledge when exploring the lexical semantic relations as the general (domain independent) knowledge in topic models.

For example, in a sentence “The picture looks great,” the aspect is “picture.” Aspect extraction consists of two sub-tasks: (1) extracting all aspect terms (e.g., “picture”) from the corpus, and (2) clustering aspect terms with similar meanings (e.g., cluster “picture” and “photo” into one aspect category as they mean the same in the domain “Camera”). In this work, we adopt the topic modeling approach as it can perform both sub-tasks simultaneously (see § 2). Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), provide an unsupervised framework for extracting latent topics in text documents. Topics are aspect categories (or simply aspects) in our context.

The counts and parameters are also updated accordingly. 7 Experiments We now evaluate the proposed MC-LDA model and compare it with state-of-the-art existing models.

The reason is that all reviews of the same type of products discuss about the same aspects of these products. Only the brand names and product names are different. Thus, using individual reviews for modeling is not very effective. Although there are approaches which model sentences (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and McDonald, 2008), we take the approach of (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), dividing each review into sentences and treating each sentence as an independent document. Sentences can be used by all three baselines without any change to their models. Although the relationships between sentences are lost, the data is fair to all models. Parameter settings: For all models, posterior inference was drawn using 1000 Gibbs iterations with an initial burn-in of 100 iterations. For all models, we set a = 1 and fl = 0.1. We found that small changes of a and fl did not affect the results much, which was also reported in (Jo and Oh, 2011) who also used online reviews. For the num</context>

Recent research has shown potential issues with perplexity as a measure: (Chang et al., 2009) suggested that the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of how well the model fits the data. The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al., 2011) (also called the “UMass” measure (Stevens and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alternative for assessing topic quality.

Our m-sets and c-sets are also more concise providing knowledge in the context of a set. As in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), we assume that there is no conflict between m-sets and c-sets, i.e., if w1 is a cannot-word of w2 (i.e., shares a c-set with w2), any word that shares an m-set with w1 is also a cannot-word of w2. Note that knowledge as m-sets has also been used in (Chen et al., 2013a) and (Chen et al., 2013b). We then propose a new topic model, called MCLDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), which is not only able to deal with c-sets and automatically adjust the number of topics, but also deal with the multiple senses and adverse effect of knowledge problems at the same time. For the issue of multiple senses, a new latent variable s is added to LDA to distinguish multiple senses (§ 3).

The GPU model was also employed in topic models in our work of (Chen et al., 2013a, 2013b). In this paper, we propose the Extended GPU (E-GPU) model. The EGPU model is more powerful in handling complex situations in dealing with c-sets. 3 Dealing with M-sets and Multiple Senses Since the proposed MC-LDA model is a major extension to our earlier work in (Chen et al., 2013a), which can deal with m-sets, we include this earlier work here as the background. To incorporate m-sets and deal with multiple senses of a word, the MDK-LDA(b) model was proposed in (Chen et al., 2013a), which adds a new latent variable s into LDA. The rationale here is that this new latent variable s guides the model to choose the right sense represented by an m-set. The generative process of MDK-LDA(b) is (the notations are explained in Table 1): 0 ~ Dirichlet(a) zi|0„ ~ Multinomial(0„) T ~ Dirichlet(fl) si|zi,T ~ Multinomial(TzL) 0 ~ Dirichlet(y) wi |zi, si, 0 ~ Multinomial (0zL,SL) 1657 Figure 1.

As discussed in § 1, due to the problem of the adverse effect of knowledge, important words may suffer from the presence of rare words in the same m-set. This problem can be dealt with the very sampling scheme of the GPU model (Chen et al., 2013a). Specifically, by adding additional 𝔸𝑠,𝑤′,𝑤 balls of color 𝑠 into 𝑈𝑡𝑆 while keeping the drawn ball, we increase the proportion (probability) of seeing the m-set 𝑠 under topic 𝑡 and thus promote m-set 𝑠 as a whole. Consequently, each word in 𝑠 is more likely to be emitted.

Some other works related with sentiment analysis include (Agarwal and Sabharwal, 2012; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Mohammad et al., 2009). In this work, we focus on topic models owing to their advantage of performing both aspect extraction and clustering simultaneously. All other approaches only perform extraction. Although there are several related works on clustering aspect terms (e.g., Carenini et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2009; Zhai et al., 2011), they all assume that the aspect terms have been extracted beforehand. We also notice that some aspect extraction models in sentiment analysis separately discover aspect words and aspect specific sentiment words (e.g., Sauper and Barzilay, 2013; Zhao et al., 2010). Our proposed model does not separate them as most sentiment words also imply aspects and most adjectives modify specific attributes of objects.

This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly. 1 Introduction In sentiment analysis and opinion mining, aspect extraction aims to extract entity aspects or features on which opinions have been expressed (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu, 2012). For example, in a sentence “The picture looks great,” the aspect is “picture.” Aspect extraction consists of two sub-tasks: (1) extracting all aspect terms (e.g., “picture”) from the corpus, and (2) clustering aspect terms with similar meanings (e.g., cluster “picture” and “photo” into one aspect category as they mean the same in the domain “Camera”). In this work, we adopt the topic modeling approach as it can perform both sub-tasks simultaneously (see § 2). Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), provide an unsupervised framework for extracting latent topics in text docu</context>

It proposed the E-GPU model to enable multiurn interactions, which enables c-sets to be naturally integrated into a topic model. To the best of our knowledge, E-GPU has not been proposed and used before. 3. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted to compare MC-LDA with several state-ofthe-art models. Experimental results based on both qualitative and quantitative measures demonstrate the superiority of MC-LDA. 1656 2 Related Work Sentiment analysis has been studied extensively in recent years (Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2008; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Wiebe et al., 2004). According to (Liu, 2012), there are three main approaches to aspect extraction: 1) Using word frequency and syntactic dependency of aspects and sentiment words for extraction (e.g., Blairgoldensohn et al., 2008; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ku et al., 2006; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2011; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Wu et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011; Zhang and Liu, 2011; Zhuang et al., 2006); 2) Using supervised sequence labeling/classification (e.g., Choi and Cardie, 2010; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Kobayashi et al., 2007; L</context>

We also notice that some aspect extraction models in sentiment analysis separately discover aspect words and aspect specific sentiment words (e.g., Sauper and Barzilay, 2013; Zhao et al., 2010). Our proposed model does not separate them as most sentiment words also imply aspects and most adjectives modify specific attributes of objects. For example, sentiment words expensive and beautiful imply aspects price and appearance respectively. Regarding the knowledge-based models, besides those discussed in § 1, the model (Hu et al., 2011) enables the user to provide guidance interactively. Blei and McAuliffe (2007) and Ramage et al. (2009) used document labels in supervised setting. In (Chen et al., 2013a), we proposed MDKLDA to leverage multi-domain knowledge, which serves as the basic mechanism to exploit m-sets in MC-LDA. In (Chen et al., 2013b), we proposed a framework (called GK-LDA) to explicitly deal with the wrong knowledge when exploring the lexical semantic relations as the general (domain independent) knowledge in topic models.

We take the approach of (Mimno et al., 2011) which approximates the true Gibbs sampling distribution by treating each word as if it were the last. For each word 𝑤𝑖 , we perform hierarchical sampling consisting of the following three steps (the detailed algorithms are given in Figures 2 and 3): Step 1 (Lines 1-11 in Figure 2): We jointly sample a topic 𝑧𝑖 and an m-set 𝑠𝑖 (containing 𝑤𝑖) for 𝑤𝑖, which gives us a blocked Gibbs sampler (Ishwaran and James, 2001), with the conditional probability given by: 𝑃(𝑧𝑖 = 𝑡, 𝑠𝑖 = 𝑠|𝒛−𝑖,𝒔−𝑖, 𝒘, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾,𝔸) ∝ ∑ ∑ 𝔸𝑠,𝑣′,𝑤′ ∙𝑛𝑡,𝑠,𝑣′ 𝑉 𝑉 −𝑖 +𝛽 𝑤′=1 𝑣′=1 × ∑ �∑ ∑ 𝔸𝑠′,𝑣′,𝑤′∙𝑛𝑡,𝑠′,𝑣′ 𝑆 𝑉 𝑉 −𝑖 +𝛽� 𝑠′=1 𝑤′=1 𝑣′=1 −𝑖 𝑛𝑡,𝑠,𝑤𝑖+𝛾𝑠 ∑ �𝑛𝑡,𝑠,𝑣′ 𝑉 −𝑖 +𝛾𝑠� 𝑣′=1 This step is the same as the Gibbs sampling for the MDK-LDA model.

To address the issue, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates two forms of prior knowledge, also called two types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. A must-link states that two words (or terms) should belong to the same topic whereas a cannotlink indicates that two words should not be in the same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more general knowledge can be specified using firstorder logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable the user to specify prior knowledge as seed words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010) also used word similarity as priors for guidance. However, none of the existing models is capable of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Furthermore, none of the existing models, including DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. The domain knowledge, such as cannot-links, may change the number of topics. There ar</context>
<context position="5320" citStr="Jagarlamudi et al., 2012" startWordPosition="834" endWordPosition="837">e major shortcomings: Incapability of handling multiple senses: A word typically has multiple meanings or senses. For example, light can mean “of little weight” or “something that makes things visible.” DF-LDA cannot handle multiple senses because its definition of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A, B, and C should be in the same topic. This case also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), (Petterson et al., 2010), and (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed set), which is restrictive as the amount of knowledge should not be limited. Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge: When using must-links or seeds, existing models basically try to ensure that the words in a mustlink or a seed set have similar probabilities under a topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link comprises of a frequent word and an infrequent word, due to the redistribution of probability mass, the probability of the frequent word will decrease while the probability of the infrequ</context>

For a comprehensive evaluation, we consider the following variations of MC-LDA and DF-LDA: • MC-LDA: MC-LDA with both m-sets and csets. This is the newly proposed model. • M-LDA: MC-LDA with m-sets only. This is the MDK-LDA model in (Chen et al., 2013a). • DF-M: DF-LDA with must-links only. • DF-MC: DF-LDA with both must-links and cannot-links. This is the full DF-LDA model in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). We do not compare with seeded models in (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) as seed sets are special cases of must-links and they also do not allow c-sets (or cannot-links). 7.1 Datasets and Settings Datasets: We use product reviews from four domains (types of products) from Amazon.com for evaluation. The corpus statistics are shown in Table 2 (columns 2 and 3). The domains are “Camera,” “Food,” “Computer,” and “Care” (short for “Personal Care”).

Sentences as documents: As noted in (Titov and McDonald, 2008), when standard topic models are applied to reviews as documents, they tend to produce topics that correspond to global properties of products (e.g., brand name), which make topics overlapping with each other. The reason is that all reviews of the same type of products discuss about the same aspects of these products. Only the brand names and product names are different. Thus, using individual reviews for modeling is not very effective. Although there are approaches which model sentences (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and McDonald, 2008), we take the approach of (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), dividing each review into sentences and treating each sentence as an independent document. Sentences can be used by all three baselines without any change to their models. Although the relationships between sentences are lost, the data is fair to all models. Parameter settings: For all models, posterior inference was drawn using 1000 Gibbs iterations with an initial burn-in of 100 iterations. For all models, we set a = 1 and fl = 0.1. We found that small changes of a and fl did not affect the results much, which wa</context>

This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly. 1 Introduction In sentiment analysis and opinion mining, aspect extraction aims to extract entity aspects or features on which opinions have been expressed (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu, 2012). For example, in a sentence “The picture looks great,” the aspect is “picture.” Aspect extraction consists of two sub-tasks: (1) extracting all aspect terms (e.g., “picture”) from the corpus, and (2) clustering aspect terms with similar meanings (e.g., cluster “picture” and “photo” into one aspect category as they mean the same in the domain “Camera”). In this work, we adopt the topic modeling approach as it can perform both sub-tasks simultaneously (see § 2). Topic models, such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003), provide an unsupervised framework for extracting latent topics in text documents. Topic</context>
<context position="3073" citStr="Liu, 2012" startWordPosition="474" endWordPosition="475"> and needs (Chang et al., 2009). To address the issue, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates two forms of prior knowledge, also called two types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. A must-link states that two words (or terms) should belong to the same topic whereas a cannotlink indicates that two words should not be in the same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more general knowledge can be specified using firstorder logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable the user to specify prior knowledge as seed words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010) also used word similarity as priors for guidance. However, none of the existing models is capable of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Furthermore, none of the existing models, including DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. The domain knowledge, such as cannot-links, may change the number of topics. There are two types of cannot-links: consistent and</context>
<context position="5270" citStr="Liu, 2012" startWordPosition="828" endWordPosition="829">ge-based topic models also have some major shortcomings: Incapability of handling multiple senses: A word typically has multiple meanings or senses. For example, light can mean “of little weight” or “something that makes things visible.” DF-LDA cannot handle multiple senses because its definition of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A, B, and C should be in the same topic. This case also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), (Petterson et al., 2010), and (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed set), which is restrictive as the amount of knowledge should not be limited. Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge: When using must-links or seeds, existing models basically try to ensure that the words in a mustlink or a seed set have similar probabilities under a topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link comprises of a frequent word and an infrequent word, due to the redistribution of probability mass, the probability of the frequent word </context>

To the best of our knowledge, E-GPU has not been proposed and used before. 3. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted to compare MC-LDA with several state-ofthe-art models. Experimental results based on both qualitative and quantitative measures demonstrate the superiority of MC-LDA. 1656 2 Related Work Sentiment analysis has been studied extensively in recent years (Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2008; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Wiebe et al., 2004). According to (Liu, 2012), there are three main approaches to aspect extraction: 1) Using word frequency and syntactic dependency of aspects and sentiment words for extraction (e.g., Blairgoldensohn et al., 2008; Hu and Liu, 2004; Ku et al., 2006; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Qiu et al., 2011; Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Wu et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011; Zhang and Liu, 2011; Zhuang et al., 2006); 2) Using supervised sequence labeling/classification (e.g., Choi and Cardie, 2010; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010); 3) Topic models (Branavan et al., 2008; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Fang and </context>

For a comprehensive evaluation, we consider the following variations of MC-LDA and DF-LDA: • MC-LDA: MC-LDA with both m-sets and csets. This is the newly proposed model. • M-LDA: MC-LDA with m-sets only. This is the MDK-LDA model in (Chen et al., 2013a). • DF-M: DF-LDA with must-links only. • DF-MC: DF-LDA with both must-links and cannot-links. This is the full DF-LDA model in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). We do not compare with seeded models in (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) as seed sets are special cases of must-links and they also do not allow c-sets (or cannot-links). 7.1 Datasets and Settings Datasets: We use product reviews from four domains (types of products) from Amazon.com for evaluation. The corpus statistics are shown in Table 2 (columns 2 and 3). The domains are “Camera,” “Food,” “Computer,” and “Care” (short for “Personal Care”). We have made the datasets publically available at the website of the first author.

Since topics from topic models are rankings based on word probability and we do not know the number of correct topical words, a natural way to evaluate these rankings is to use Precision@n (or p@n) which was also used in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010), where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n = 5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation: topic labeling and word labeling. Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in (Mimno et al., 2011) and asked the judges to label each topic as good or bad. Each topic was presented as a list of 10 most probable words in descending order of their probabilities under that topic. The models which generated the topics for labeling were obscure to the judges. In general, each topic was annotated as good if it had more than half of its words coherently related to each other </context>

This is the newly proposed model. • M-LDA: MC-LDA with m-sets only. This is the MDK-LDA model in (Chen et al., 2013a). • DF-M: DF-LDA with must-links only. • DF-MC: DF-LDA with both must-links and cannot-links.

Note that knowledge as m-sets has also been used in (Chen et al., 2013a) and (Chen et al., 2013b). We then propose a new topic model, called MCLDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), which is not only able to deal with c-sets and automatically adjust the number of topics, but also deal with the multiple senses and adverse effect of knowledge problems at the same time. For the issue of multiple senses, a new latent variable s is added to LDA to distinguish multiple senses (§ 3). Then, we employ the generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model (Mahmoud, 2008) to address the issue of adverse effect of knowledge (§ 4). Deviating from the standard topic modeling approaches, we propose the Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (§ 5). E-GPU extends the GPU model to enable multi-urn interactions. This is necessary for handling c-sets and for adjusting the number of topics. E-GPU is the heart of MC-LDA. Due to the extension, a new inference mechanism is designed for MC-LDA (§ 6). Note that E-GPU is generic and can be used in any appropriate application. In summary, this paper makes the following three contributions: 1. It proposed a new knowledge-</context>

In (Chen et al., 2013a), we proposed MDKLDA to leverage multi-domain knowledge, which serves as the basic mechanism to exploit m-sets in MC-LDA. In (Chen et al., 2013b), we proposed a framework (called GK-LDA) to explicitly deal with the wrong knowledge when exploring the lexical semantic relations as the general (domain independent) knowledge in topic models. But these models above did not consider the knowledge in the form of c-sets (or cannot-links). The generalized Pólya urn (GPU) model (Mahmoud, 2008) was first introduced in LDA by Mimno et al. (2011). However, Mimno et al. (2011) did not use domain knowledge. Our results in § 7 show that using domain knowledge can significantly improve aspect extraction. The GPU model was also employed in topic models in our work of (Chen et al., 2013a, 2013b). In this paper, we propose the Extended GPU (E-GPU) model.

The second stage (steps 2 and 3) of the Gibbs sampler for MCLDA (for dealing with c-sets) is applied after burn-in phrase. Domain knowledge: User knowledge about a domain can vary a great deal. Different users may have very different knowledge. To reduce this variance for a more reliable evaluation, instead of asking a human user to provide m-sets, we obtain the synonym sets and the antonym sets of each word that is a noun or adjective (as words of other parts-of-speech usually do not indicate aspects) from WordNet (Miller, 1995) and manually verify the words in those sets for the domain. Note that if a word 𝑤 is not provided with any m-set, it is treated as a singleton m-set {𝑤}. For c-sets, we ran LDA in each domain and provide c-sets based on the wrong results of LDA as in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Then, the knowledge is provided to each model in the format required by each model. The numbers of m-sets and c-sets are listed in columns 4 and 5 of Table 2.

Inference of 𝑧 and 𝑠 can be computationally expensive due to the non-exchangeability of words under the E-GPU models. We take the approach of (Mimno et al., 2011) which approximates the true Gibbs sampling distribution by treating each word as if it were the last. For each word 𝑤𝑖 , we perform hierarchical sampling consisting of the following three steps (the detailed algorithms are given in Figures 2 and 3): Step 1 (Lines 1-11 in Figure 2): We jointly sample a topic 𝑧𝑖 and an m-set 𝑠𝑖 (containing 𝑤𝑖) for 𝑤𝑖, which gives us a blocked Gibbs sampler (Ishwaran and James, 2001), with the conditional probability given by: 𝑃(𝑧𝑖 = 𝑡, 𝑠𝑖 = 𝑠|𝒛−𝑖,𝒔−𝑖, 𝒘, 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾,𝔸) ∝ ∑ ∑ 𝔸𝑠,𝑣′,𝑤′ ∙𝑛𝑡,𝑠,𝑣′ 𝑉 𝑉 −𝑖 +𝛽 𝑤′=1 𝑣′=1 × ∑ �∑ ∑ 𝔸𝑠′,𝑣′,𝑤′∙𝑛𝑡,𝑠′,𝑣′ 𝑆 𝑉 𝑉 −𝑖 +𝛽� 𝑠′=1 𝑤′=1 𝑣′</context>

The counts and parameters are also updated accordingly. 7 Experiments We now evaluate the proposed MC-LDA model and compare it with state-of-the-art existing models. Two unsupervised baseline models that we compare with are: • LDA: LDA is the basic unsupervised topic model (Blei et al., 2003). • LDA-GPU: LDA with GPU (Mimno et al., 2011). Specifically, LDA-GPU applies GPU in LDA using co-document frequency. As for knowledge-based models, we focus on comparing with DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), which is perhaps the best known knowledge-based model and it allows both mustlinks and cannot-links.

However, the perplexity metric does not reflect the semantic coherence of individual topics learned by a topic model (Newman et al., 2010). Recent research has shown potential issues with perplexity as a measure: (Chang et al., 2009) suggested that the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of how well the model fits the data. The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al., 2011) (also called the “UMass” measure (Stevens and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alternative for assessing topic quality. This metric relies upon word co-occurrence statistics within the documents, and does not depend on external resources or human labeling. It was shown that topic coherence is highly consistent with human expert labeling by Mimno et al. (2011). Higher topic coherence score indicates higher quality of topics, i.e., better topic interpretability.

Since topics from topic models are rankings based on word probability and we do not know the number of correct topical words, a natural way to evaluate these rankings is to use Precision@n (or p@n) which was also used in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010), where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n = 5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation: topic labeling and word labeling. Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in (Mimno et al., 2011) and asked the judges to label each topic as good or bad. Each topic was presented as a list of 10 most probable words in descending order of their probabilities under that topic. The models which generated the topics for labeling were obscure to the judges. In general, each topic was annotated as good if it had more than half of its words coherently related to each other representing a semantic concept together; otherwise bad.

To address the issue, several knowledge-based topic models have been proposed. The DF-LDA model (Andrzejewski et al., 2009) incorporates two forms of prior knowledge, also called two types of constraints: must-links and cannot-links. A must-link states that two words (or terms) should belong to the same topic whereas a cannotlink indicates that two words should not be in the same topic. In (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), more general knowledge can be specified using firstorder logic. In (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012), seeded models were proposed. They enable the user to specify prior knowledge as seed words/terms for some topics. Petterson et al. (2010) also used word similarity as priors for guidance. However, none of the existing models is capable of incorporating the cannot-link type of knowledge except DF-LDA (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). Furthermore, none of the existing models, including DF-LDA, is able to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. The domain knowledge, such as cannot-links, may change the number of topics. There are two types of cannot-links: consistent and</context>

For example, light can mean “of little weight” or “something that makes things visible.” DF-LDA cannot handle multiple senses because its definition of must-link is transitive. That is, if A and B form a must-link, and B and C form a must-link, it implies a must-link between A and C, indicating A, B, and C should be in the same topic. This case also applies to the models in (Andrzejewski et al., 2011), (Petterson et al., 2010), and (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012). Although the model in (Jagarlamudi et al., 2012) allows multiple senses, it requires that each topic has at most one set of seed words (seed set), which is restrictive as the amount of knowledge should not be limited. Sensitivity to the adverse effect of knowledge: When using must-links or seeds, existing models basically try to ensure that the words in a mustlink or a seed set have similar probabilities under a topic. This causes a problem: if a must-link comprises of a frequent word and an infrequent word, due to the redistribution of probability mass, the probability of the frequent word </context>

For a comprehensive evaluation, we consider the following variations of MC-LDA and DF-LDA: • MC-LDA: MC-LDA with both m-sets and csets. This is the newly proposed model. • M-LDA: MC-LDA with m-sets only. This is the MDK-LDA model in (Chen et al., 2013a). • DF-M: DF-LDA with must-links only. • DF-MC: DF-LDA with both must-links and cannot-links. This is the full DF-LDA model in (Andrzejewski et al., 2009). We do not compare with seeded models in (Burns et al., 2012; Jagarlamudi et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012) as seed sets are special cases of must-links and they also do not allow c-sets (or cannot-links). 7.1 Datasets and Settings Datasets: We use product reviews from four domains (types of products) from Amazon.com for evaluation. The corpus statistics are shown in Table 2 (columns 2 and 3). The domains are “Camera,” “Food,” “Computer,” and “Care” (short for “Personal Care”). We have made the datasets publically available at the website of the first author.

Since topics from topic models are rankings based on word probability and we do not know the number of correct topical words, a natural way to evaluate these rankings is to use Precision@n (or p@n) which was also used in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010), where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n = 5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation: topic labeling and word labeling. Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in (Mimno et al., 2011) and asked the judges to label each topic as good or bad. Each topic was presented as a list of 10 most probable words in descending order of their probabilities under that topic. The models which generated the topics for labeling were obscure to the judges. In general, each topic was annotated as good if it had more than half of its words coherently related to each other </context>

Topic Coherence score for different proportions of knowledge. LDA model objectively. Topic models are often evaluated using perplexity on held-out test data. However, the perplexity metric does not reflect the semantic coherence of individual topics learned by a topic model (Newman et al., 2010). Recent research has shown potential issues with perplexity as a measure: (Chang et al., 2009) suggested that the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of how well the model fits the data. The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al., 2011) (also called the “UMass” measure (Stevens and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alternative for assessing topic quality. This metric relies upon word co-occurrence statistics within the documents,</context>

However, the perplexity metric does not reflect the semantic coherence of individual topics learned by a topic model (Newman et al., 2010). Recent research has shown potential issues with perplexity as a measure: (Chang et al., 2009) suggested that the perplexity can sometimes be contrary to human judgments. Also, perplexity does not really reflect our goal of finding coherent aspects with accurate semantic clustering. It only provides a measure of how well the model fits the data. The Topic Coherence metric (Mimno et al., 2011) (also called the “UMass” measure (Stevens and Buttler, 2012)) was proposed as a better alternative for assessing topic quality. This metric relies upon word co-occurrence statistics within the documents, and does not depend on external resources or human labeling. It was shown that topic coherence is highly consistent with human expert labeling by Mimno et al. (2011). Higher topic coherence score indicates higher quality of topics, i.e., better topic interpretability. Effects of Number of Topics Since our proposed models and the baseline models are all parametric models, we first compare each model given different numbers of topics. Figure 4 shows the </context>

Although the relationships between sentences are lost, the data is fair to all models. Parameter settings: For all models, posterior inference was drawn using 1000 Gibbs iterations with an initial burn-in of 100 iterations. For all models, we set a = 1 and fl = 0.1. We found that small changes of a and fl did not affect the results much, which was also reported in (Jo and Oh, 2011) who also used online reviews. For the number of topics T, we tried different values (see §7.2) as it is hard to know the exact number of topics. While non-parametric Bayesian approaches (Teh et al., 2006) aim to estimate T from the corpus, they are often sensitive to the hyper-parameters (Heinrich, 2009). 1 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml 2 http://jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lewis04a/a11-smart-stop-list 1661 3 6 9 12 15 MC-LDA M-LDA LDA DF-M DF-MC LDA-GPU 0% 25% 50% 100% MC-LDA M-LDA DF-M DF-MC -1200 -1300 -1400 -1500 -1600 -1240 -1260 -1280 -1300 -1320 Figure 4.

Corpus statistics with #m-sets and #c-sets having at least two words. Pre-processing: We ran the Stanford Core NLP Tools1 to perform sentence detection and lemmatization. Punctuations, stopwords 2 , numbers and words appearing less than 5 times in each corpus were removed. The domain name was also removed, e.g., word camera in the domain “Camera”, since it co-occurs with most words in the corpus, leading to high similarity among topics/aspects. Sentences as documents: As noted in (Titov and McDonald, 2008), when standard topic models are applied to reviews as documents, they tend to produce topics that correspond to global properties of products (e.g., brand name), which make topics overlapping with each other. The reason is that all reviews of the same type of products discuss about the same aspects of these products. Only the brand names and product names are different. Thus, using individual reviews for modeling is not very effective. Although there are approaches which model sentences (Jo and Oh, 2011; Titov and McDonald, 2008), we take the approach of (Brody and Elhadad, 2010), dividing ea</context>

Although there are several related works on clustering aspect terms (e.g., Carenini et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2009; Zhai et al., 2011), they all assume that the aspect terms have been extracted beforehand. We also notice that some aspect extraction models in sentiment analysis separately discover aspect words and aspect specific sentiment words (e.g., Sauper and Barzilay, 2013; Zhao et al., 2010). Our proposed model does not separate them as most sentiment words also imply aspects and most adjectives modify specific attributes of objects. For example, sentiment words expensive and beautiful imply aspects price and appearance respectively. Regarding the knowledge-based models, besides those discussed in § 1, the model (Hu et </context>

Since topics from topic models are rankings based on word probability and we do not know the number of correct topical words, a natural way to evaluate these rankings is to use Precision@n (or p@n) which was also used in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Zhao et al., 2010), where n is the rank position. We give p@n for n = 5 and 10. There are two steps in human evaluation: topic labeling and word labeling. Topic Labeling: We followed the instructions in (Mimno et al., 2011) and asked the judges to label each topic as good or bad. Each topic was presented as a list of 10 most probable words in descending order of their probabilities under that topic. The models which generated the topics for labeling were obscure to the judges. In general, each topic was annotated as good if it had more than half of its words coherently related to each other representing a seman</context>

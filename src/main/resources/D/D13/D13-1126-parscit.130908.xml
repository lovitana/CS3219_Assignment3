Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999423533333333">
Building search engines that can respond to
spoken queries with spoken content requires
that the system not just be able to find useful
responses, but also that it know when it has
heard enough about what the user wants to be
able to do so. This paper describes a simula-
tion study with queries spoken by non-native
speakers that suggests that indicates that find-
ing relevant content is often possible within
a half minute, and that combining features
based on automatically recognized words with
features designed for automated prediction of
query difficulty can serve as a useful basis for
predicting when that useful content has been
found.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99948772">
Much of the early work on what has come to be
called “speech retrieval” has focused on the use of
text queries to rank segments that are automatically
extracted from spoken content. While such an ap-
proach can be useful in a desktop environment, half
of the world’s Internet users can access the global
information network only using a voice-only mobile
phone. This raises two challenges: 1) in such set-
tings, both the query and the content must be spo-
ken, and 2) the language being spoken will often be
one for which we lack accurate speech recognition.
The Web has taught us that the “ten blue links”
paradigm can be a useful response to short queries.
That works because typed queries are often fairly
precise, and tabular responses are easily skimmed.
However, spoken queries, and in particular open-
domain spoken queries for unrestricted spoken con-
tent, pose new challenges that call for new thinking
about interaction design. This paper explores the po-
tential of a recently proposed alternative, in which
the spoken queries are long, and only one response
can be played at a time by the system. This ap-
proach, which has been called Query by Babbling,
requires that the user ramble on about what they
are looking for, that the system be able to estimate
when it has found a good response, and that the user
be able to continue the search interaction by bab-
bling on if the first response does not fully meet their
needs (Oard, 2012).
One might question whether users actually will
“babble” for extended periods about their informa-
tion need. There are two reasons to believe that
some users might. First, we are particularly inter-
ested in ultimately serving users who search for in-
formation in languages for which we do not have us-
able speech recognition systems. Speech-to-speech
matching in such cases will be challenging, and we
would not expect short queries to work well. Sec-
ond, we seek to principally serve users who will be
new to search, and thus not yet conditioned to issue
short queries. As with Web searchers, we can ex-
pect them to explore initially, then to ultimately set-
tle on query strategies that work well enough to meet
their needs. If longer queries work better for them,
it seems reasonable to expect that they would use
longer queries. Likewise, if systems cannot effec-
tively use longer queries to produce useful results,
then people will not use them.
To get a sense for whether such an interaction
modality is feasible, we performed a simulation

study for this paper in which we asked people to
babble on some topic for which we already have rel-
evance judgments results. We transcribe those bab-
bles using automatic speech recognition (ASR), then
note how many words must be babbled in each case
before an information retrieval system is first able to
place a relevant document in rank one. From this
perspective, our results show that people are indeed
often able to babble usefully; and, moreover, that
current information retrieval technology could of-
ten place relevant results at rank one within half a
minute or so of babbling even with contemporary
speech recognition technology.
The question then arises as to whether a system
can be built that would recognize when an answer
is available at rank one. Barging in with an answer
before that point wastes time and disrupts the user;
barging in long after that point also wastes time, but
also risks user abandonment. We therefore want a
“Goldilocks” system that can get it just about right.
To this end, we introduce an evaluation measure that
differentially penalizes early and late responses. Our
experiments using such a measure show that systems
can be built that, on average, do better than could be
achieved by any fixed response delay.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: We begin in Section 2 with a brief review of
related work. Section 3 then describes the design
of the ranking component of our experiment; Sec-
tion 4 follows with some exploratory analysis of the
ranking results using our test collection. Section 6
completes the description of our methods with an
explanation of how the stopping classifier is built;
Section 7 then presents end-to-end evaluation results
using a new measure designed for this task. Sec-
tion 8 concludes the paper with some remarks on
future work.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999906897959184">
The rapid adoption of remarkably inexpensive mo-
bile telephone services among low-literacy users
in developing and emerging markets has generated
considerable interest in so-called “spoken forum”
projects (Sherwani et al., 2009; Agarwal et al., 2010;
Medhi et al., 2011; Mudliar et al., 2012). It is rel-
atively straightforward to collect and store spoken
content regardless of the language in which it is spo-
ken; organizing and searching that content is, how-
ever, anything but straightforward. Indeed, the cur-
rent lack of effective search services is one of the
key inhibitors that has, to date, limited spoken fo-
rums to experimental settings with at most a few
hundred users. If a “spoken web” is to achieve the
same degree of impact on the lives of low-literacy
users in the developing world that the World Wide
Web has achieved over the past decade in the devel-
oped world, we will need to develop the same key
enabler: an effective search engine.
At present, spoken dialog systems of conventional
design, such as Siri, rely on complex and expen-
sive language-specific engineering, which can eas-
ily be justified for the “languages of wealth” such
as English, German, and Chinese; but perhaps not
for many of the almost 400 languages that are each
spoken by a million or more people.1 An alterna-
tive would be to adopt more of an “information re-
trieval” perspective by directly matching words spo-
ken in the query with words that had been spoken in
the content to be searched. Some progress has been
made on this task in the MediaEval benchmark eval-
uation, which has included a spoken content match-
ing task each year since 2011 (Metze et al., 2012).
Results for six low-resource Indian and African lan-
guages indicate that miss rates of about 0.5 can be
achieved on individual terms, with false alarm rates
below 0.01, by tuning acoustic components that had
originally been developed for languages with rea-
sonably similar phonetic inventories. Our goal in
this paper is to begin to explore how such capabil-
ities might be employed in a complete search en-
gine for spoken forum content, as will be evaluated
for the first time at MediaEval 2013.2 The princi-
pal impediment to development in this first year of
that evaluation is the need for relevance judgments,
which are not currently available for spoken content
of the type we wish to search. That consideration
has motivated our design of the simulation study re-
ported in this paper.

3 Setup and Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966269230769">
The approach taken in this paper is to simulate, as
closely as possible, babbling about topics for which
we a) already have relevance judgments available,
and b) have the ability to match partial babbles with
potential answers in ways that reflect the errors in-
troduced by speech processing. To this end, we
chose to ask non-native English speakers to babble,
in English, about an information need that is stimu-
lated by an existing English Text Retrieval Confer-
ence (TREC) topic for which we already have rel-
evance judgments. An English Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) system was then used to gener-
ate recognized words for those babbles. Those rec-
ognized words, in turn, have been used to rank order
the (character-coded written text) news documents
that were originally used in TREC, the documents
for which we have relevance judgments. Our goal
then becomes twofold: to first rank the documents
in such a way as to get a relevant document into rank
one; and then to recognize when we have done so.
Figure 1 is a visual representation of retrieval re-
sults as a person babbles. For three different bab-
bles prompted by TREC Topic 274, it shows the re-
ciprocal rank for the query that is posed after each
additional word is recognized. We are primarily in-
terested in cases where the reciprocal rank is one.3

In these three babbles we see all cases that the re-
trieval system must take into account: babbles that
never yield a relevant first-ranked document (Bab-
ble 2); babbles that eventually yield a relevant first-
rank document, and that continue to do so as the
person speaks (Babble 1); and babbles that alternate
between good and bad results as the speaker contin-
ues (Babble 3).

study: 255, 257, 258, 260, 266, 271, 274, 276, 287,
and 297 based on our expectation of which of the 50
TREC 5 topics would be most suitable for prompted
babbles. In making this choice, we avoided TREC
topics that we felt would require specialized do-
main knowledge, experience with a particular cul-
ture, or detailed knowledge of an earlier time period,
such as when the topics had been crafted. For each
topic, three babbles were created by people speak-
ing at length about the same information need that
the TREC topic reflected. For convenience, the peo-
ple who created the babbles were second-language
speakers of English selected from information tech-
nology companies. There were a total of ten bab-
blers; each recorded, in English, babbles for three
topics, yielding a total of thirty babbles. We main-
tained a balance across topics when assigning topic
that the most highly ranked known relevant document is in po-

numbers to babblers. All babblers had more than
sixteen years of formal education, had a strong com-
mand on the English language, and had some in-
formation about the topics that they selected. They
were all briefed about our motivation for collecting
this data, and about the concept of query by bab-
bling.
The babbles were created using a phone interface.
Each subject was asked to call an interactive voice
response (IVR) system. The system prompted the
user for a three digit topic ID. After obtaining the
topic ID, the system then prompted the user to start
speaking about what they were looking for. TREC
topics contain a short title, a description, and a nar-
rative. The title is generally something a user might
post as an initial Web query; the description is some-
thing one person might say to another person who
might then help them search; the narrative is a few
sentences meant to reflect what the user might jot
down as notes to themselves on what they were actu-
ally looking for. For easy reference, the system pro-
vided a short description—derived from the descrip-
tion and narrative of the TREC topics—that gave
the user the context around which to speak. The
user was expected to begin speaking after hearing
a system-generated cue, at which time their speech
was recorded. Two text files were produced from the
audio babbles: one produced via manual transcrip-

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975">
The TREC-5 Associated Press (AP) and Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) news stories were indexed by In-
dri (Strohman et al., 2004) using the Krovetz stem-
mer (Krovetz, 1993), standard English stopword set-
tings, and language model matching. Each babble
was turned into a set of nested queries by sequen-
tially concatenating words. Specifically, the first
query contained only the first word from the bab-
ble, the second query only the first two words, and
so on. Thus, the number of queries presented to In-
dri for a given babble was equivalent to the num-
ber of words in the babble, with each query differ-
ing only by the number of words it contained. The
results were scored using trec eval version 9.0.
For evaluation, we were interested in the reciprocal
rank; in particular, where the reciprocal rank was
one. This measure tells us when Indri was able to
place a known relevant document at rank one.

4 Working with Babbles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971034482759">
Our experiment design presents three key chal-
lenges. The first is ranking well despite errors in
speech processing. Table 2 shows the average Word
Error Rate (WER) for each topic, over three babbles.
Averaging further over all thirty babbles, we see that
about half the words are correctly recognized. While
this may seem low, it is in line with observations
from other spoken content retrieval research: over
classroom lectures (Chelba et al., 2007), call center
recordings (Mamou et al., 2006), and conversational
telephone speech (Chia et al., 2010). Moreover, it is
broadly consistent with the reported term-matching
results for low density languages in MediaEval.
The second challenge lies in the scorability of the
system guesses. Table 3 provides an overview of
where relevance was found within our collection of
babbles. It includes only the subset of babbles for
which, during the babble, at least one known rele-
vant document was found at the top of the ranked
list. The table presents the number of recognized
words—a proxy for the number of potential stop-
ping points—and at how many of those potential
stopping points the document ranked in position 1
is known to be relevant, known not to be relevant, or
of unknown relevance. Because of the way in which
TREC relevance judgments were created, unknown
relevance indicates that no TREC system returned
the document near the top of their ranked list. At
TREC, documents with unknown relevance are typ-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.97297">
1274
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.987523553571429">
ically scored as if they are not relevant;5 we make
the same assumption.
Table 3 also shows how much we would need to
rely on that assumption: the “scorable” fraction for
which the relevance of the top-ranked document is
known, rather than assumed, ranges from 93 per cent
down to 5 per cent. In the averages that we report be-
low, we omit the five babbles with scorable fractions
of 30 per cent or less. On average, over the 10 top-
ics for which more than 30 per cent of the potential
stopping points are scorable, there are 37 stopping
points at which our system could have been scored
as successful based on a known relevant document
in position 1. In three of these cases, the challenge
for our stopping classifier is extreme, with only a
handful—between two and seven—of such opportu-
nities.
A third challenge is knowing when to interrupt
to present results. The ultimate goal of our work
is to predict when the system should interrupt the
babbler and barge-in to present an answer in which
they might be interested. Table 3 next presents
the word positions at which known relevant docu-
ments first and last appear in rank one (“First Rel”).
This are the earliest and latest scorable successful
stopping points. As can be seen, the first possi-
ble stopping point exhibits considerable variation,
as does the last. For some babbles—babble 274-3,
for example—almost any choice of stopping points
would be fine. In other cases—babble 258-1, for
example—a stopping point prediction would need to
be spot on to get any useful results at all. Moreover,
we can see both cases in different babbles for the
same topic despite the fact that both babblers were
prompted by the same topic; for example, babbles
257-1 and 257-3, which are, respectively, fairly easy
and fairly hard.
Finally, we can look for interaction effects be-
tween speech processing errors and scorability. The
rightmost column of Table 3 shows the measured
WER for each scorable babble. Of the 10 scorable
babbles for which more than 30 per cent of the po-
tential stopping points are scorable, three turned out
to be extremely challenging for ASR, with word er-
ror rates above 0.7. Overall, however, the WER for
5On the assumption that the TREC systems together span
the range of responses that are likely to be relevant.
the 10 babbles on which we focus is 0.56, which is
about the same as the average WER over all 30 bab-
bles.
In addition to the 15 babbles shown in Table 3,
there are another 15 babbles for which no relevant
document was retrievable. Of those, only a single
babble—babble 255-2, at 54 per cent scorable and
a WER of 0.402—had more than 30 per cent of the
potential stopping points scorable.

5 Learning to Stop
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998975">
There are several ways in which we could pre-
dict when to stop the search and barge-in with an
answer—in this paper, we consider a machine learn-
ing approach. The idea is that by building a clas-
sifier with enough information about known good
and bad babbles, a learner can make such predic-
tions better than other methods. Our stopping pre-
diction models uses four types of features for each
potential stopping point: the number of words spo-
ken so far, the average word length so far, some
“surface characteristics” of those words, and some
query performance prediction metrics. The surface
characteristics that we used were originally devel-
oped to quantify writing style—they are particularly
useful for generating readability grades of a given
document. Although many metrics for readability
have been proposed, we choose a subset: Flesch
Reading Ease (Flesch, 1948), Flesch-Kincaid Grade
Level (Kincaid et al., 1975), Automated Readabil-
ity Index (Senter and Smith, 1967), Coleman-Liau
index (Coleman and Liau, 1975), Gunning fog in-
dex (Gunning, 1968), LIX (Brown and Eskenazi,
2005), and SMOG Grading (McLaughlin, 1969).
Our expectation was that a better readability value
should correspond to use of words that are more suc-
cinct and expressive, and that a larger number of
more expressive words should help the search en-
gine to get good responses highly ranked.
As post-retrieval query difficulty prediction mea-
sures, we choose three that have been prominent
in information retrieval research: clarity (Cronen-
Townsend et al., 2002), weighted information
gain (Zhou and Croft, 2007), and normalized query
commitment (Shtok et al., 2012). Although each
takes a distinct approach, the methods all compare
some aspect of the documents retrieved by a query

with the complete collection of documents in the
collection from which that retrieval was performed.
They seek to provide some measure of information
about how likely a query is to have ranked the docu-
ments well when relevance judgments are not avail-
able. Clarity measures the difference in the language
models induced by the retrieved results and the cor-
pus as a whole. Weighted information gain and nor-
malized query commitment look at the scores of
the retrieved documents, the former comparing the
mean score of the retrieved set with that of the entire
corpus; the latter measuring the standard deviation
of the scores for the retrieved set.
Features of all four types were were created for
each query that was run for each babble; that is after
receiving each new word. A separate classifier was
then trained for each topic by creating a binary ob-
jective function for all 27 babbles for the nine other
topics, then using every query for every one of those
babbles as training instances. The objective func-
tion produces 1 if the query actually retrieved a rel-
evant document at first rank, and 0 otherwise. Fig-
ure 2 shows an example of how this training data
was created for one babble, and Table 4 shows the
resulting hold-one-topic-out cross-validation results
for intrinsic measures of classifier accuracy for three
Weka classifiers6. As can be seen, the decision tree
classifier seems to be a good choice, so in Section 7
we compare the stopping prediction model based
on a decision tree classifier trained using hold-one-
topic-out cross-validation with three baseline mod-
els.

<bodyText confidence="0.997950428571429">
To evaluate a stopping prediction model, the funda-
mental goal is to stop with a relevant document in
rank one, and to do so as close in time as possible
to the first such opportunity. If the first guess is bad,
it would be reasonable to score a second guess, with
some penalty.
Specifically, there are several things that we

would like our evaluation framework to describe.
Keeping in mind that ultimately the system will in-
terrupt the speaker to notify them of results, we first
want to avoid the interruption before we have found
a good answer. Our evaluation measure gives no
credit for such a guess. Second, we want to avoid
interrupting long after finding the first relevant an-
swer. Credit is reduced with increasing delays after
the first point where we could have barged in. Third,
when we do barge-in, there must indeed be a good
answer in rank one. This will be true if we barge-
in at the first opportunity, but if we barge-in later
the good answer we had found might have dropped
back out of the first position. No credit is given if
we barge-in such a case. Finally, if a bad position
for first barge-in is chosen, we would like at least to
get it right the second time. Thus, we limit ourselves
to two tries, awarding half the credit on the second
try that we could have received had we barged in at
the same point on the first try.
The delay penalty is modeled using an exponen-
tial distribution that declines with each new word
that arrives after the first opportunity. Let q0 be the
first point within a query where the reciprocal rank
is one. Let p� be the first “yes” guess of the predic-
tor after point q0. The score is thus eA(Q0−pi), where
A is the half-life, or the number of words by which
the exponential decay has dropped to one-half. The
equation is scaled by 0.5 if i is the second element
(guess) of p, and by 0.25 if it is the third. From Fig-
ure 1, some cases the potential stopping points are
consecutive, while in others they are intermittent—
we penalize delays from the first good opportunity
even when there is no relevant document in position
one because we feel that best models the user ex-
perience. Unjudged documents in position one are
treated as non-relevant.

We chose one deterministic and one random base-
line for comparison. The deterministic baseline
made its first guess at a calculated point in the bab-
ble, and continued to guess at each word thereafter.
The initial guess was determined by taking the aver-
age of the first scorable point of the other 27 out-of-
topic babbles.
The random baseline drew the first and second
words at which to guess “yes” as samples from a

Figure 3 shows the extent to which each classifiers
first guess is early, on time, or late. These points
falls, respectively, below the main diagonal, on the
main diagonal, or above the main diagonal. Early
guesses result in large penalties from our scoring
function, dropping the maximum score from 1.0 to
0.5; for late guesses the penalty depends on how
late the guess is. As can be seen, our decision tree
classifier (“trees”) guesses early more often than it
guesses late. For an additional four cases (not plot-
ted), the decision tree classifier never makes a guess.
Figure 4 shows the results for scoring at most
three guesses. These results are averaged over all
eleven babbles for which the decision tree classi-
fier made at least one guess; no guess was made on
babbles 257-3, 266-2, 260-3, or 274-3. These re-

sults are shown for a half-life of five words, which
is a relatively steep penalty function, essentially re-
moving all credit after about ten seconds at normal
speaking rates. The leftmost point in each figure,
plotted at a “window size” of one, shows the results
for the stopping prediction models as we have de-
scribed them. It is possible, and indeed not unusual,
for our decision tree classifier to make two or three
guesses in a row, however, in part because it has no
feature telling it how long is has been since its most
recent guess. To see whether adding a bit of patience
would help, we added a deterministic period follow-
ing each guess in which no additional guess would
be allowed. We call the point at which this delay ex-
pires, and a guess is again allowed, the delay “win-
dow.”
As can be seen, a window size of ten or eleven—
allowing the next guess no sooner than the tenth or
eleventh subsequent word—is optimal for the deci-
sion tree classifier when averaged over these eleven
babbles. The random classifier has an optimal point
between window sizes of 21 and 26, but is gener-
ally not as good as the other classifiers. The deter-
ministic classifier displays the most variability, but
for window sizes greater than 14, it is the best solu-
tion. Although it has fewer features available to it—
knowing only the mean number of words to the first
opportunity for other topics—it is able to outperform
the decision tree classifier for relatively large win-
dow sizes.
From this analysis we conclude that our decision
tree classifier shows promise; and that going for-
ward, it would likely be beneficial to integrate fea-
tures of the deterministic classifier. We can also
conclude that these results are, at best, suggestive—
a richer test collection will ultimately be required.
Moreover, we need some approach to accommodate
the four cases in which the decision tree classifier
never guesses. Setting a maximum point at which
the first guess will be tried could be a useful initial
heuristic, and one that would be reasonable to apply
in practice.

8 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985722222222">
We have used a simulation study to show that build-
ing a system for query by babbling is feasible. More-
over, we have suggested a reasonable evaluation
measure for this task, and we have shown that sev-
eral simple baselines for predicting stopping points
can be beaten by a decision tree classifier. Our next
step is to try these same techniques with spoken
questions and spoken answers in a low-resource lan-
guage using the test collection that is being devel-
oped for the MediaEval 2013 Question Answering
for the Spoken Web task.
Another potentially productive direction for fu-
ture work would be to somehow filter the queries
in ways that improve the rankings. Many potential
users of this technology in the actual developing re-
gion settings that we wish to ultimately serve will
likely have no experience with Internet search en-
gines, and thus they may be even less likely to fo-

cus their babbles on useful terms to the same extent
that our babblers did in these experiments. There
has been some work on techniques for recognizing
useful query terms in long queries, but of course we
will need to do that with spoken queries, and more-
over with queries spoken in a language for which
we have at lest limited speech processing capabili-
ties available. How best to model such a situation
in a simulation study is not yet clear, so we have
deferred this question until the MediaEval speech-
to-speech test collection becomes available.
In the long term, many of the questions we are ex-
ploring will also has implications for open-domain
Web search in other hands- or eyes-free applications
such as driving a car or operating an aircraft.

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999633375">
Personal profile information on social media
like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the
core of many interesting applications, such as
talent recommendation and contextual advertis-
ing. However, personal profiles usually lack or-
ganization confronted with the large amount of
available information. Therefore, it is always a
challenge for people to find desired information
from them. In this paper, we address the task of
personal profile summarization by leveraging
both personal profile textual information and so-
cial networks. Here, using social networks is
motivated by the intuition that, people with
similar academic, business or social connections
(e.g. co-major, co-university, and co-
corporation) tend to have similar experience and
summaries. To achieve the learning process, we
propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model
to incorporate all these resources of knowledge
to summarize personal profiles with local textual
attribute functions and social connection factors.
Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset
from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effective-
ness of the proposed approach.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999667714285714">
Web 2.0 has empowered people to actively interact
with each other, forming social networks around
mutually interesting information and publishing a
large amount of useful user-generated content
(UGC) online (Lappas et al., 2011; Tan et al.,
2011). One popular and important type of UGC is
the personal profile, where people post detailed

information on online portals about their education,
experiences and other personal information. Social
websites like Facebook.com and LinkedIn.com
have created a viable business as profile portals,
with the popularity and success partially attributed
to their comprehensive personal profiles.
Generally, online personal profiles provide val-
uable resources for businesses, especially for hu-
man resource managers to find talents, and help
people connect with others of similar backgrounds
(Yang et al., 2011a; Guy et al., 2010). However, as
there is always large-scale information of experi-
ence and education fields, it is hardly for us to find
useful information from the profile. Therefore, it is
always a challenge for people to find desired in-
formation from them. For this regard, it is highly
desirable to develop reliable methods to generate a
summary of a person through his profile automati-
cally.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first re-
search that explores automatic summarization of
personal profiles in social media. A straightfor-
ward approach is to consider personal profile
summarization as a traditional document summari-
zation problem, which treating each personal pro-
file independently and generate a summary for
each personal profile individually. For example,
the well-known extraction and ranking approaches
(e.g. PageRank, HITS) extract a certain amount of
important sentences from a document according to
some ranking measurements to form a summary
(Wan and Yang, 2008; Wan, 2011).
However, such straightforward approaches are
not sufficient to benefit from the carrier of person-
al profiles. As the centroid of social networking,
people are usually connected to others with similar

background in social media (e.g. co-major, co-
corporation). Therefore, it is reasonable to lever-
age social connection to improve the performance
of profile summarizing. For example if there are
co-major, co-university, co-corporation or other
academic and business relationships between two
persons, we consider them sharing similar experi-
ence and having similar summaries.
The remaining challenge is how to incorporate
both the profile textual information and the con-
nection knowledge in the social networks. In this
study, we propose a collective factor graph model
(CoFG) to summarize the text of personal profile
in social networks with local textual information
and social connection information. The CoFG
framework utilizes both the local textual attribute
functions of an individual person and the social
connection factor between different persons to col-
lectively summarize personal profile on one person.
In this study, we treat the profile summarization
as a supervised learning task. Specifically, we
model each sentence of the profile as a vector. In
the training phase, we use the vectors with the so-
cial connection between each person to build the
CoFG model; while in the testing phase, we per-
form collective inference for the importance of
each sentence and select a subset of sentences as
the summary according to the trained model. Eval-
uation on a large-scale data from LinkedIn.com
indicates that our proposed joint model and social
connection information improve the performance
of profile summarization.
The remainder of our paper is structured as fol-
lows. We go over the related work in Section 2. In
Section 3, we introduce the data we collected from
LinkedIn.com and the annotated corpus we con-
structed. In Section 4, we present some motiva-
tional analysis. In Section 5, we explain our pro-
posed model and describe algorithms for parame-
ter estimation and prediction. In Section 6, we pre-
sent our experimental results. We sum up our work
and discuss future directions in Section 7.

2 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993775">
In this section, we will introduce the related work
on the traditional topic-based summarization, so-
cial-based summarization and factor graph model
respectively.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.942267">
2.1 Topic-based Summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985">
Generally, traditional topic-based summarization
can be categorized into two categories: extractive
(Radev et al., 2004) and abstractive (Radev and
McKeown, 1998) summarization. The former se-
lects a subset of sentences from original docu-
ment(s) to form a summary; the latter reorganizes
some sentences to form a summary where several
complex technologies, such as information fusion,
sentence compression and reformulation are nec-
essarily employed (Wan and Yang, 2008; Celiky-
ilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2011; Wang and Zhou,
2012). This study focuses on extractive summari-
zation.
Radev et al. (2004) proposed a centroid-based
method to rank the sentences in a document set,
using various kinds of features, such as the cluster
centroid, position and TF-IDF features. Ryang and
Abekawa (2012) proposed a reinforcement learn-
ing approach on text summarization, which models
the summarization within a reinforcement learn-
ing-based framework.
Compared to unsupervised approaches, super-
vised learning for summarization is relatively rare.
A typical work is Shen et al., (2007) which present
a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based frame-
work to treat the summarization task as a sequence
labeling problem. However, different from all ex-
isting studies, our work is the first attempt to con-
sider both textual information and social relation-
ship information for supervised summarization.
</bodyText>

2.2 Social-based Summarization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999931117647059">
As web 2.0 has empowered people to actively in-
teract with each other, studies focusing on social
media have attracted much attention recently
(Meeder et al., 2011; Rosenthal and McKeown,
2011; Yang et al., 2011a). Social-based summari-
zation is exactly a special case of summarization
where the social connection is employed to help
obtaining the summarization. Although topic-
based summarization has been extensively studied,
studies on social-based summarization are relative
new and rare.
Hu et al., (2011) proposed an unsupervised Pag-
eRank-based social summarization approach by
incorporating both document context and user con-
text in the sentence evaluation process. Meng et al.,
(2012) proposed a unified optimization framework
to produce opinion summaries of tweets through

<bodyText confidence="0.999814333333333">
integrating information from dimensions of topic,
opinion and insight, as well as other factors (e.g.
topic relevancy, redundancy and language styles).
Unlike all the above studies, this paper focuses
on a novel task, profile summarization. Further-
more, we employ many other kinds of social in-
formation in profiles, such as co-major, and co-
corporation between two people. They are shown
to be very effective for profile summarization.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995944">
2.3 Factor Graph Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999556">
As social network has been investigated for sever-
al years (Leskovec et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2011;
Lu et al., 2010; Guy et al., 2010) and Factor Graph
Model (FGM) is a popular approach to describe
the relationship of social network (Tang et al.,
2011a; Zhuang et al., 2012). Factor Graph Model
builds a graph to represent the relationship of
nodes on the social networks, and the factor func-
tions are always considered to represent the rela-
tionship of the nodes.
Tang et al. (2011a) and Zhuang et al. (2012)
formalized the problem of social relationship
learning into a semi-supervised framework, and
proposed Partially-labeled Pairwise Factor Graph
Model (PLP-FGM) for learning to infer the type of
social ties. Dong et al. (2012) gave a formal defini-
tion of link recommendation across heterogeneous
networks, and proposed a ranking factor graph
model (RFG) for predicting links in social net-
works, which effectively improves the predictive
performance. Yang et al., (2011b) generated sum-
maries by modeling tweets and social contexts into
a dual wing factor graph (DWFG), which utilized
the mutual reinforcement between Web documents
and their associated social contexts.
Different from all above researches, this paper
proposes a pair-wise factor graph model to collec-
tively utilize both textual information and social
connection factor to generate summary of profile.

From Table 1, we can see that,
➢ The information of each profile is incom-
plete and inconsistent, That is, not all kinds
of fields are available in each personal’s
profile.
➢ Most people provide their experience and
education information. However, the Sum-
mary fields are popularly missing (Only
about 30% of people provide it). This is
mainly because writing summary is nor-
mally more difficult than other fields.
Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop
reliable automatic methods to generate a
summary of a person through his/her pro-
file.
➢ The length of the Experience field is the
longest one, and work experience always
could represent general information of

3.3 Corpus Construction and Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999882">
Among the 921 profiles that contain the summary,
we manually select 497 profiles with high quality
summary to construct the corpus for our research.
These high-quality summaries are all written by
the authors themselves. Here, the quality is meas-
ured by manually checking that whether they are
well capable of summarizing their profiles. That is,
they are written carefully, and could give an over-
view of a person and represent the education and
experience information of a person.
After carefully seeing the profiles, we observe
that the Experience field contains the most abun-
dant information of a person. Thus, we treat the
text of Experience field as the source of summary
for each profile. Besides, we collect social context
information from Education and Experience field,
and these social contexts are including by
LinkedIn explicitly. Table 2 shows the average
length of summary and experience fields we used
for evaluating our summarization approach.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99816429032258">
We first describe the social connections which
we used. Figure 2 shows an example of social
connection between people from the profiles of
LinkedIn. We find that people are sometimes con-
nected by several social connections. For example,
John and Lucy are connected by co_unvi relation-
ship, while Lily and Linda are connected by
co_corp relationship. From LinkedIn, four kinds of
social relationship between people are extracted
from the Education field and Experience field.
They are:
➢ co_major denotes that two persons have the
same major at school
➢ co_univ denotes that two persons are graduat-
ed from the same university
➢ co_title denotes that two persons have the
same title at corporation.
➢ co_corp denotes that two persons work at the
same corporation.
Our basic motivation of using social connection
lies in the fact that “connected” people will tend to
hold related experience and similar summaries.
We then give the statistics of edges of social
connection. Table 3 shows basic statistics across
these edges. From Table 3, we can see that the
number of users is 497 while the number of social
connection edges is 14,307. The latter is much
larger than the former. The number of the edges
from Education field is similar with the number of
the edges from Experience filed. Among all the
relationships, co_unvi is the most common one.

In this section, we propose a collective factor

the text of personal profile with local textual in-

5.1 Overview of Our Framework
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999862448275862">
To generate summaries for profiles, a straightfor-
ward approach is to treat each personal profile in-
dependently and generating a summary for each
personal profile individually. As we mentioned on
Section 3.3, we use the sentences of Experience
field as a text document and consider it as the
source of summary for each profile.
Instead, we formalize the problem of personal
profile summarization in a pair-wise factor graph
model and propose an approach referred to as
Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm to learn the
model for generating the summary of the profile.
Our basic idea is to define the correlations using
different types of factor functions. An objective
function is defined based on the joint probability
of the factor functions. Thus, the problem of col-
lective personal profile summarization model
learning is cast as learning model parameters that
maximizes the joint probability of the input con-
tinuous dynamic network.
The overview of the proposed method is a su-
pervised framework (as shown in Figure 3). First,
we treat each sentence of the training data and test-
ing data as vectors with textual information (local
textual attribute functions); Second, all the vectors
are connected by social connection relationships
(social connection factors) and we model these
vectors and their relationships into the collective
factor graph; third, we propose Loopy Belief Prop-

agation algorithm to learn the model and predict
the sentences of testing data; finally, we select a
subset of sentences of each testing profile as the
summary according to the models with top-n pre-
diction score. Thus, the core issues of our frame-
work are 1) how to define the collective factor
graph model to connection profiles with social
connection; 2) how to learn and predict the pro-
posed CoFG model; 3) how to predict the sentenc-
es from the testing data with the proposed CoFG
model, and generate the summary by the predict
scores. We will discuss these issues on the follow-

The textual attributes include following features
(Shen et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2011b):
Social connection factor function g(y, , y;) :
For the social correlation factor function, we de-
fine it through the pairwise network structure. That
is, if the person of sentence i and the person of
sentence j have a social relationship, a factor func-
tion for this social connection is defined (Tang et
al., 2011a; Tang et al., 2011b), i.e.,
The person-person social relationships are de-
fined on Section 4, e.g. co_major, co_univ, co_title,
and co_corp. We define that if two persons have at
least one social connection edge, they have a so-
cial relationship. In addition,Q is the weight of
the function, representing the influence degree of i
on j.
To better understand our model, one example of
factor decomposition is given in Figure 4. In this
example, there are six sentences from three pro-
files. Among them, four sentences are labeled (two

<bodyText confidence="0.999972761904762">
In the experiment, we use the corpus collected
from LinkedIn.com that contains 497 profiles (see
more details in Section 3). The existing summaries
in these profiles are served as the reference sum-
mary (the standard answers). As discussed in sub-
section 3.3, the average length of summary is
about 40 words. Thus, we extract 40 words to con-
struct the summary for each profile. We use 200
personal profiles as the testing data, and the re-
maining ones as the training data.
We use the ROUGE-1.5.5 (Lin and Hovy, 2004)
toolkit for evaluation, a popular tool that has been
widely adopted by several evaluations such as
DUC and TAC (Wan and Yang, 2008; Wan, 2011).
We provide four of the ROUGE F-measure scores
in the experimental results: ROUGE-2 (bigram-
based), ROUGE-L (based on longest common
subsequences), ROUGE-W (based on weighted
longest common subsequence, weight=1.2), and
ROUGE-SU4 (based on skip bigram with a maxi-
mum skip distance of 4).

We compare the proposed CoFG approach with
three baselines illustrated as follows:
➢ Random: we randomly select sentences of
each profile to generate the summary for the
profile.
➢ HITS: we employ the HITS algorithm to per-
form profile summarization (Wan and Yang,
2008). In detail, we first consider the words as
hubs the sentences as authorities; Then, we
rank the sentences with the authorities’ scores
for each profile individually; Finally, the
highest ranked sentences are chosen to consti-
tute the summary.
➢ PageRank: we employ the PageRank algo-
rithm to perform profile summarization (Wan
and Yang, 2008). In detail, we first connect
the sentences of the profile with cosine text-
based similar measure to construct a graph;
Then, we apply PageRank algorithm to rank
the sentence through the graph for each pro-
file individually; Finally, the highest ranked
sentences are chosen to constitute the sum-
mary.
➢ MaxEnt: as a supervised learning approach,
maximum entropy uses textual attribute as
features to train a classification model. Then,
the classification model is employed to pre-
dict which sentences can be selected to gener-
ate the summary. For the implementation of
MaxEnt, we employ the tool of mallent
toolkits4.
Table 4 shows the comparison results of our ap-
proach (CoFG) and the baseline approaches. From
Table 4, we can see that 1) either HITS or Pag-
eRank outperforms the approach of random selec-
tion; 2) The supervised approach i.e. MaxEnt, out-
performs both the HITS algorithm and the Pag-
eRank approach; 3) CoFG model performs best
and it greatly outperforms both the unsupervised
and supervised learning baseline approaches in
terms of the ROUGE-2 F-measure score. This re-
sult verifies the effectiveness of considering the
social connection between the sentences in differ-
ent profiles,
Figure 6 shows the performance of our proposed
CoFG model with different sizes of training data.
From Figure 6, we can see that CoFG model with
social connection always performs better than
MaxEnt, and the performance of our approach de-
scends slowly when the training dataset becomes
small. Specifically, the performance of CoFG us-
ing only 10% training data achieves better perfor-
mance than MaxEnt using 100% training data.

that the CoFG model considers the social edges of

From Table 5, we can see that all of our pro-
posed approaches, i.e., CoFG-edu, CoFG-exp, and
CoFG, outperform the baseline approach, i.e.,
MaxEnt. However, the performance of CoFG-edu,
CoFG-exp and CoFG are similar. This result is
mainly due to the fact that the information of so-
cial connection is redundant. For example, two
persons who are connected by co_major (educa-
tion field) might also be connected by co_corp
(experience field).

7 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987111111111">
In this paper, we present a novel task named pro-
file summarization and propose a novel approach
called collective factor graph model to address this
task. One distinguishing feature of the proposed
approach lies in its incorporating the social con-
nection. Empirical studies demonstrate that the
social connection is effective for profile summari-
zation, which enables our approach outperform
some competitive supervised and unsupervised
baselines.
The main contribution of this paper is to explore
social context information to help generate the
summary of the profiles, which represents an in-
teresting research direction in social network min-
ing. In the future work, we will explore more kinds
of social context information and investigate better
ways of incorporating them into profile summari-
zation and a wider range of social network mining.

<abstract confidence="0.99747164">Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections and cotend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</abstract>

The former selects a subset of sentences from original document(s) to form a summary; the latter reorganizes some sentences to form a summary where several complex technologies, such as information fusion, sentence compression and reformulation are necessarily employed (Wan and Yang, 2008; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2011; Wang and Zhou, 2012). This study focuses on extractive summarization. Radev et al. (2004) proposed a centroid-based method to rank the sentences in a document set, using various kinds of features, such as the cluster centroid, position and TF-IDF features. Ryang and Abekawa (2012) proposed a reinforcement learning approach on text summarization, which models the summarization within a reinforcement learning-based framework.

Social websites like Facebook.com and LinkedIn.com have created a viable business as profile portals, with the popularity and success partially attributed to their comprehensive personal profiles. Generally, online personal profiles provide valuable resources for businesses, especially for human resource managers to find talents, and help people connect with others of similar backgrounds (Yang et al., 2011a; Guy et al., 2010). However, as there is always large-scale information of experience and education fields, it is hardly for us to find useful information from the profile. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. For this regard, it is highly desirable to develop reliable methods to generate a summary of a person through his profile automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that explores automatic summarization of personal profiles in social media. A straightforward approach is to consider personal profile summarization as a traditional</context>

Factor Graph Model builds a graph to represent the relationship of nodes on the social networks, and the factor functions are always considered to represent the relationship of the nodes. Tang et al. (2011a) and Zhuang et al. (2012) formalized the problem of social relationship learning into a semi-supervised framework, and proposed Partially-labeled Pairwise Factor Graph Model (PLP-FGM) for learning to infer the type of social ties.

To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1 Introduction Web 2.0 has empowered people to actively interact with each other, forming social networks around mutually interesting information and publishing a large amount of useful user-generated content (UGC) online (Lappas et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2011). One popular and important type of UGC is the personal profile, where people post detailed * Corresponding author information on online portals about their education, experiences and other personal information. Social websites like Facebook.com and LinkedIn.com have created a viable business as profile portals, with the popularity and success partially attributed to their comprehensive personal profiles.

A straightforward approach is to consider personal profile summarization as a traditional document summarization problem, which treating each personal profile independently and generate a summary for each personal profile individually. For example, the well-known extraction and ranking approaches (e.g. PageRank, HITS) extract a certain amount of important sentences from a document according to some ranking measurements to form a summary (Wan and Yang, 2008; Wan, 2011). However, such straightforward approaches are not sufficient to benefit from the carrier of personal profiles.

The former selects a subset of sentences from original document(s) to form a summary; the latter reorganizes some sentences to form a summary where several complex technologies, such as information fusion, sentence compression and reformulation are necessarily employed (Wan and Yang, 2008; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2011; Wang and Zhou, 2012). This study focuses on extractive summarization. Radev et al. (2004) proposed a centroid-based method to rank the sentences in a document set, using various kinds of features, such as the cluster centroid, position and TF-IDF features. Ryang and Abekawa (2012) proposed a reinforcement learning approach on text summarization, which models the summarization within a reinforcement learning-based framework. Compared to unsupervised approaches, supervised learning for summarization is relatively rare. A typical work is Shen et al., (2007) wh</context>

Thus, we extract 40 words to construct the summary for each profile. We use 200 personal profiles as the testing data, and the remaining ones as the training data. We use the ROUGE-1.5.5 (Lin and Hovy, 2004) toolkit for evaluation, a popular tool that has been widely adopted by several evaluations such as DUC and TAC (Wan and Yang, 2008; Wan, 2011).

(2012) formalized the problem of social relationship learning into a semi-supervised framework, and proposed Partially-labeled Pairwise Factor Graph Model (PLP-FGM) for learning to infer the type of social ties. Dong et al. (2012) gave a formal definition of link recommendation across heterogeneous networks, and proposed a ranking factor graph model (RFG) for predicting</context>

A similar gradient can be derived for parameter ai . We approximate the marginal distribution Zhuang et al., 2012). With the marginal probabilities, the gradient can be obtained by summing over all triads. It is worth noting that we need to perform the LBP process twice for each iteration: one is to estimate the marginal distribution of unknown variables y; = ? and the other is to estimate the marginal distribution over all pairs.

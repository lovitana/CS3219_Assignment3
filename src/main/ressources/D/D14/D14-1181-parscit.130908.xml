We report on a series of experiments with
convolutional neural networks (CNN)
trained on top of pre-trained word vec-
tors for sentence-level classification tasks.
We show that a simple CNN with lit-
tle hyperparameter tuning and static vec-
tors achieves excellent results on multi-
ple benchmarks. Learning task-specific
vectors through fine-tuning offers further
gains in performance. We additionally
propose a simple modification to the ar-
chitecture to allow for the use of both
task-specific and static vectors. The CNN
models discussed herein improve upon the
state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which
include sentiment analysis and question
classification.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949169811321">
Deep learning models have achieved remarkable
results in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al.,
2012) and speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013)
in recent years. Within natural language process-
ing, much of the work with deep learning meth-
ods has involved learning word vector representa-
tions through neural language models (Bengio et
al., 2003; Yih et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013)
and performing composition over the learned word
vectors for classification (Collobert et al., 2011).
Word vectors, wherein words are projected from a
sparse, 1-of-V encoding (here V is the vocabulary
size) onto a lower dimensional vector space via a
hidden layer, are essentially feature extractors that
encode semantic features of words in their dimen-
sions. In such dense representations, semantically
close words are likewise close—in euclidean or
cosine distance—in the lower dimensional vector
space.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize
layers with convolving filters that are applied to
local features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally
invented for computer vision, CNN models have
subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP
and have achieved excellent results in semantic
parsing (Yih et al., 2014), search query retrieval
(Shen et al., 2014), sentence modeling (Kalch-
brenner et al., 2014), and other traditional NLP
tasks (Collobert et al., 2011).
In the present work, we train a simple CNN with
one layer of convolution on top of word vectors
obtained from an unsupervised neural language
model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et
al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News,
and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the
word vectors static and learn only the other param-
eters of the model. Despite little tuning of hyper-
parameters, this simple model achieves excellent
results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that
the pre-trained vectors are ‘universal’ feature ex-
tractors that can be utilized for various classifica-
tion tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through
fine-tuning results in further improvements. We
finally describe a simple modification to the archi-
tecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and
task-specific vectors by having multiple channels.
Our work is philosophically similar to Razavian
et al. (2014) which showed that for image clas-
sification, feature extractors obtained from a pre-
trained deep learning model perform well on a va-
riety of tasks—including tasks that are very dif-
ferent from the original task for which the feature
extractors were trained.

where ® is the concatenation operator. In gen-
eral, let xi:i+j refer to the concatenation of words
xi, xi+1, ... , xi+j. A convolution operation in-
volves a filter w E Rhk, which is applied to a
window of h words to produce a new feature. For
example, a feature ci is generated from a window
of words xi:i+h−1 by

Here b E R is a bias term and f is a non-linear
function such as the hyperbolic tangent. This filter
is applied to each possible window of words in the
sentence {x1:h, x2:h+1, . . . , xn−h+1:n} to produce
a feature map

with c E Rn−h+1. We then apply a max-over-
time pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011)
over the feature map and take the maximum value
cˆ = max{c} as the feature corresponding to this
particular filter. The idea is to capture the most im-
portant feature—one with the highest value—for
each feature map. This pooling scheme naturally
deals with variable sentence lengths.
We have described the process by which one
feature is extracted from one filter. The model
uses multiple filters (with varying window sizes)
to obtain multiple features. These features form
the penultimate layer and are passed to a fully con-
nected softmax layer whose output is the probabil-
ity distribution over labels.
In one of the model variants, we experiment
with having two ‘channels’ of word vectors—one
that is kept static throughout training and one that
is fine-tuned via backpropagation (section 3.2).2
In the multichannel architecture, illustrated in fig-
ure 1, each filter is applied to both channels and
the results are added to calculate ci in equation
(2). The model is otherwise equivalent to the sin-
gle channel architecture.

2.1 Regularization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984222222222">
For regularization we employ dropout on the
penultimate layer with a constraint on l2-norms of
the weight vectors (Hinton et al., 2012). Dropout
prevents co-adaptation of hidden units by ran-
domly dropping out—i.e., setting to zero—a pro-
portion p of the hidden units during foward-
backpropagation. That is, given the penultimate
layer z = [ˆc1, ... , ˆcm] (note that here we have m
filters), instead of using
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.982428">
y = w · z + b (4)
for output unit y in forward propagation, dropout
uses
y = w · (z o r) + b, (5)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.952915666666667">
where o is the element-wise multiplication opera-
tor and r E Rm is a ‘masking’ vector of Bernoulli
random variables with probability p of being 1.
Gradients are backpropagated only through the
unmasked units. At test time, the learned weight
vectors are scaled by p such that wˆ = pw, and
wˆ is used (without dropout) to score unseen sen-
tences. We additionally constrain l2-norms of the
weight vectors by rescaling w to have ||w||2 = s
whenever ||w||2 &gt; s after a gradient descent step.
2We employ language from computer vision where a color
image has red, green, and blue channels.

4 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896470588235">
Results of our models against other methods are
listed in table 2. Our baseline model with all ran-
domly initialized words (CNN-rand) does not per-
form well on its own. While we had expected per-
formance gains through the use of pre-trained vec-
tors, we were surprised at the magnitude of the
gains. Even a simple model with static vectors
(CNN-static) performs remarkably well, giving
competitive results against the more sophisticated
deep learning models that utilize complex pool-
ing schemes (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) or require
parse trees to be computed beforehand (Socher
et al., 2013). These results suggest that the pre-
trained vectors are good, ‘universal’ feature ex-
tractors and can be utilized across datasets. Fine-
tuning the pre-trained vectors for each task gives
still further improvements (CNN-non-static).

4.1 Multichannel vs. Single Channel Models
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991025">
We had initially hoped that the multichannel ar-
chitecture would prevent overfitting (by ensuring
that the learned vectors do not deviate too far
from the original values) and thus work better than
the single channel model, especially on smaller
datasets. The results, however, are mixed, and fur-
ther work on regularizing the fine-tuning process
is warranted. For instance, instead of using an
additional channel for the non-static portion, one
could maintain a single channel but employ extra
dimensions that are allowed to be modified during
training.

4.2 Static vs. Non-static Representations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995647058824">
As is the case with the single channel non-static
model, the multichannel model is able to fine-tune
the non-static channel to make it more specific to
the task-at-hand. For example, good is most sim-
ilar to bad in word2vec, presumably because
they are (almost) syntactically equivalent. But for
vectors in the non-static channel that were fine-
tuned on the SST-2 dataset, this is no longer the
case (table 3). Similarly, good is arguably closer
to nice than it is to great for expressing sentiment,
and this is indeed reflected in the learned vectors.
For (randomly initialized) tokens not in the set
of pre-trained vectors, fine-tuning allows them to
learn more meaningful representations: the net-
work learns that exclamation marks are associ-
ated with effusive expressions and that commas
are conjunctive (table 3).

We finally describe a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and task-specific vectors by having multiple channels. Our work is philosophically similar to Razavian et al. (2014) which showed that for image classification, feature extractors obtained from a pretrained deep learning model perform well on a variety of tasks—including tasks that are very different from the original task for which the feature extractors were trained. 2 Model The model architecture, shown in figure 1, is a slight variant of the CNN architecture of Collobert et al. (2011). Let xi ∈ Rk be the k-dimensional word vector corresponding to the i-th word in the sentence. A sentence of length n (padded where 1https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 1746 Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1746–1751, October 25-29, 2014, Doha, Qatar. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics wait for the video and do n&apos;t rent it n x k representation of Convolutional layer with Max-over-time Fully connected layer sentence with static and multiple filter widths and pooling with dropout and non-static channels feature ma</context>

A convolution operation involves a filter w E Rhk, which is applied to a window of h words to produce a new feature. For example, a feature ci is generated from a window of words xi:i+h−1 by ci = f(w · xi:i+h−1 + b). (2) Here b E R is a bias term and f is a non-linear function such as the hyperbolic tangent. This filter is applied to each possible window of words in the sentence {x1:h, x2:h+1, . . . , xn−h+1:n} to produce a feature map c = [c1, c2, ... , cn−h+1], (3) with c E Rn−h+1. We then apply a max-overtime pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) over the feature map and take the maximum value cˆ = max{c} as the feature corresponding to this particular filter. The idea is to capture the most important feature—one with the highest value—for each feature map. This pooling scheme naturally deals with variable sentence lengths. We have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one filter. The model uses multiple filters (with varying window sizes) to obtain multiple features. These features form the penultimate layer and are passed to a fully connected softmax layer whose output is the probability distribution over labe</context>

We do not otherwise perform any datasetspecific tuning other than early stopping on dev sets. For datasets without a standard dev set we randomly select 10% of the training data as the dev set. Training is done through stochastic gradient descent over shuffled mini-batches with the Adadelta update rule (Zeiler, 2012). 3.2 Pre-trained Word Vectors Initializing word vectors with those obtained from an unsupervised neural language model is a popular method to improve performance in the absence of a large supervised training set (Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2011; Iyyer et al., 2014). We use the publicly available word2vec vectors that were trained on 100 billion words from Google News. The vectors have dimensionality of 300 and were trained using the continuous bag-of-words architecture (Mikolov et al., 2013). Words not present in the set of pre-trained words are initialized randomly. 3.3 Model Variations We experiment with several variants of the model. • CNN-rand: Our baseline model where all words are randomly initialized and then modified during training. • CNN-static: A model with pre-trained vectors from word2vec. All words</context>
<context position="17709" citStr="Collobert et al. (2011)" startWordPosition="2878" endWordPosition="2881">ork and simply let dropout regularize it. Dropout consistently added 2%–4% relative performance. • When randomly initializing words not in word2vec, we obtained slight improvements by sampling each dimension from U[−a, a] where a was chosen such that the randomly initialized vectors have the same variance as the pre-trained ones. It would be interesting to see if employing more sophisticated methods to mirror the distribution of pre-trained vectors in the initialization process gives further improvements. • We briefly experimented with another set of publicly available word vectors trained by Collobert et al. (2011) on Wikipedia,8 and found that word2vec gave far superior performance. It is not clear whether this is due to Mikolov et al. (2013)’s architecture or the 100 billion word Google News dataset. • Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) gave similar results to Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) but required fewer epochs. 5 Conclusion In the present work we have described a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks built on top of word2vec. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, a simple CNN with one layer of convolution performs remarkably well. Our results add to the well-established evidence that u</context>

In one of the model variants, we experiment with having two ‘channels’ of word vectors—one that is kept static throughout training and one that is fine-tuned via backpropagation (section 3.2).2 In the multichannel architecture, illustrated in figure 1, each filter is applied to both channels and the results are added to calculate ci in equation (2). The model is otherwise equivalent to the single channel architecture. 2.1 Regularization For regularization we employ dropout on the penultimate layer with a constraint on l2-norms of the weight vectors (Hinton et al., 2012). Dropout prevents co-adaptation of hidden units by randomly dropping out—i.e., setting to zero—a proportion p of the hidden units during fowardbackpropagation. That is, given the penultimate layer z = [ˆc1, ... , ˆcm] (note that here we have m filters), instead of using y = w · z + b (4) for output unit y in forward propagation, dropout uses y = w · (z o r) + b, (5) where o is the element-wise multiplication operator and r E Rm is a ‘masking’ vector of Bernoulli random variables with probability p of being 1. Gradients are backpropagated only through the unmasked units. At test time, the lear</context>

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize layers with convolving filters that are applied to local features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing (Yih et al., 2014), search query retrieval (Shen et al., 2014), sentence modeling (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), and other traditional NLP tasks (Collobert et al., 2011).

Our baseline model with all randomly initialized words (CNN-rand) does not perform well on its own. While we had expected performance gains through the use of pre-trained vectors, we were surprised at the magnitude of the gains. Even a simple model with static vectors (CNN-static) performs remarkably well, giving competitive results against the more sophisticated deep learning models that utilize complex pooling schemes (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) or require parse trees to be computed beforehand (Socher et al., 2013). These results suggest that the pretrained vectors are good, ‘universal’ feature extractors and can be utilized across datasets. Finetuning the pre-trained vectors for each task gives still further improvements (CNN-non-static). 4.1 Multichannel vs. Single Channel Models We had initially hoped that the multichannel architecture would prevent overfitting (by ensuring that the learned vectors do not deviate too far from the original values) and thus work better than the single channel model, especially on smaller datasets.

Similarly, good is arguably closer to nice than it is to great for expressing sentiment, and this is indeed reflected in the learned vectors. For (randomly initialized) tokens not in the set of pre-trained vectors, fine-tuning allows them to learn more meaningful representations: the network learns that exclamation marks are associated with effusive expressions and that commas are conjunctive (table 3). 4.3 Further Observations We report on some further experiments and observations: • Kalchbrenner et al. (2014) report much worse results with a CNN that has essentially the same architecture as our single channel model. For example, their Max-TDNN (Time Delay Neural Network) with randomly initialized words obtains 37.4% on the SST-1 dataset, compared to 45.0% for our model. We attribute such discrepancy to our CNN having much more capacity (multiple filter widths and feature maps). • Dropout proved to be such a good regularizer that it was fine to use a larger than necessary network and simply let dropout regularize it. Dropout consistently added 2%–4% relative performance. • When randomly initializin</context>

We show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance. We additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both task-specific and static vectors. The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include sentiment analysis and question classification. 1 Introduction Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013) in recent years. Within natural language processing, much of the work with deep learning methods has involved learning word vector representations through neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Yih et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013) and performing composition over the learned word vectors for classification (Collobert et al., 2011).

We use the publicly available word2vec vectors that were trained on 100 billion words from Google News. The vectors have dimensionality of 300 and were trained using the continuous bag-of-words architecture (Mikolov et al., 2013). Words not present in the set of pre-trained words are initialized randomly. 3.3 Model Variations We experiment with several variants of the model. • CNN-rand: Our baseline model where all words are randomly initialized and then modified during training. • CNN-static: A model with pre-trained vectors from word2vec.

It would be interesting to see if employing more sophisticated methods to mirror the distribution of pre-trained vectors in the initialization process gives further improvements. • We briefly experimented with another set of publicly available word vectors trained by Collobert et al. (2011) on Wikipedia,8 and found that word2vec gave far superior performance. It is not clear whether this is due to Mikolov et al. (2013)’s architecture or the 100 billion word Google News dataset. • Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) gave similar results to Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) but required fewer epochs. 5 Conclusion In the present work we have described a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks built on top of word2vec. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, a simple CNN with one layer of convolution performs remarkably well. Our results add to the well-established evidence that unsupervised pre-training of word vectors is an important ingredient in deep learning for NLP. Acknowledgments We would like to than</context>

Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that the pre-trained vectors are ‘universal’ feature extractors that can be utilized for various classification tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning results in further improvements. We finally describe a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and task-specific vectors by having multiple channels. Our work is philosophically similar to Razavian et al. (2014) which showed that for image classification, feature extractors obtained from a pretrained deep learning model perform well on a variety of tasks—including tasks that are very different from the original task for which the feature extractors were trained. 2 Model The model architecture, shown in figure 1, is a slight variant of the CNN architecture of Collobert et al.

In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close—in euclidean or cosine distance—in the lower dimensional vector space. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize layers with convolving filters that are applied to local features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing (Yih et al., 2014), search query retrieval (Shen et al., 2014), sentence modeling (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), and other traditional NLP tasks (Collobert et al., 2011). In the present work, we train a simple CNN with one layer of convolution on top of word vectors obtained from an unsupervised neural language model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News, and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the word vectors static and learn only the other parameters of the model.

Training is done through stochastic gradient descent over shuffled mini-batches with the Adadelta update rule (Zeiler, 2012). 3.2 Pre-trained Word Vectors Initializing word vectors with those obtained from an unsupervised neural language model is a popular method to improve performance in the absence of a large supervised training set (Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2011; Iyyer et al., 2014).

Our baseline model with all randomly initialized words (CNN-rand) does not perform well on its own. While we had expected performance gains through the use of pre-trained vectors, we were surprised at the magnitude of the gains. Even a simple model with static vectors (CNN-static) performs remarkably well, giving competitive results against the more sophisticated deep learning models that utilize complex pooling schemes (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) or require parse trees to be computed beforehand (Socher et al., 2013). These results suggest that the pretrained vectors are good, ‘universal’ feature extractors and can be utilized across datasets. Finetuning the pre-trained vectors for each task gives still further improvements (CNN-non-static). 4.1 Multichannel vs. Single Channel Models We had initially hoped that the multichannel architecture would prevent overfitting (by ensuring that the learned vectors do not deviate too far from the original values) and thus work better than the single channel model, especially on smaller datasets. The results, however, are mixed, and further work on regularizing the fi</context>

The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include sentiment analysis and question classification. 1 Introduction Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013) in recent years. Within natural language processing, much of the work with deep learning methods has involved learning word vector representations through neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Yih et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013) and performing composition over the learned word vectors for classification (Collobert et al., 2011). Word vectors, wherein words are projected from a sparse, 1-of-V encoding (here V is the vocabulary size) onto a lower dimensional vector space via a hidden layer, are essentially feature extractors that encode semantic features of words in their dimensions. In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close—in euclidean or cosine distance—in the lower dimensional vector space.

In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close—in euclidean or cosine distance—in the lower dimensional vector space. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize layers with convolving filters that are applied to local features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved excellent results in semantic parsing (Yih et al., 2014), search query retrieval (Shen et al., 2014), sentence modeling (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), and other traditional NLP tasks (Collobert et al., 2011). In the present work, we train a simple CNN with one layer of convolution on top of word vectors obtained from an unsupervised neural language model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News, and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the word vectors static and learn only the other parameters of the model. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on </context>

These values were chosen via a grid search on the SST-2 dev set. We do not otherwise perform any datasetspecific tuning other than early stopping on dev sets. For datasets without a standard dev set we randomly select 10% of the training data as the dev set. Training is done through stochastic gradient descent over shuffled mini-batches with the Adadelta update rule (Zeiler, 2012). 3.2 Pre-trained Word Vectors Initializing word vectors with those obtained from an unsupervised neural language model is a popular method to improve performance in the absence of a large supervised training set (Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2011; Iyyer et al., 2014). We use the publicly available word2vec vectors that were trained on 100 billion words from Google News. The vectors have dimensionality of 300 and were trained using the continuous bag-of-words architecture (Mikolov et al., 2013). Words not present in the set of pre-trained words are initialized randomly. 3.3 Model Var</context>

It would be interesting to see if employing more sophisticated methods to mirror the distribution of pre-trained vectors in the initialization process gives further improvements. • We briefly experimented with another set of publicly available word vectors trained by Collobert et al. (2011) on Wikipedia,8 and found that word2vec gave far superior performance. It is not clear whether this is due to Mikolov et al. (2013)’s architecture or the 100 billion word Google News dataset. • Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) gave similar results to Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) but required fewer epochs. 5 Conclusion In the present work we have described a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks built on top of word2vec. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, a simple CNN with one layer of convolution performs remarkably well. Our results add to the well-established evidence that unsupervised pre-training of word vectors is an important ingredient in deep learning for NLP.

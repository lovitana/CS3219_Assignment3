Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99975848">
In this paper, we investigate a challeng-
ing task of automatic related work gener-
ation. Given multiple reference papers as
input, the task aims to generate a related
work section for a target paper. The gen-
erated related work section can be used
as a draft for the author to complete his
or her final related work section. We
propose our Automatic Related Work
Generation system called ARWG to ad-
dress this task. It first exploits a PLSA
model to split the sentence set of the giv-
en papers into different topic-biased parts,
and then applies regression models to
learn the importance of the sentences. At
last it employs an optimization frame-
work to generate the related work section.
Our evaluation results on a test set of 150
target papers along with their reference
papers show that our proposed ARWG
system can generate related work sec-
tions with better quality. A user study is
also performed to show ARWG can
achieve an improvement over generic
multi-document summarization baselines.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.996528836734694">
The related work section is an important part of a
paper. An author often needs to help readers to
understand the context of his or her research
problem and compare his or her current work
with previous works. A related work section is
often used for this purpose to show the differ-
ences and advantages of his or her work, com-
pared with related research works. In this study,
we attempt to automatically generate a related
work section for a target academic paper with its
reference papers. This kind of related work sec-
tions can be used as a basis to reduce the author’s
time and effort when he or she wants to complete
his or her final related work section.
Automatic related work section generation is a
very challenging task. It can be considered a top-
ic-biased, multiple-document summarization
problem. The input is a target academic paper,
which has no related work section, along with its
reference papers. The goal is to create a related
work section that describes the related works and
addresses the relationship between the target pa-
per and the reference papers. Here we assume
that the set of reference papers has been given as
part of the input. Existing works in the NLP and
recommendation systems communities have al-
ready focused on the task of finding reference
papers. For example, citation prediction (Nal-
lapati et al., 2008) aims at finding individual pa-
per citation patterns.
Generally speaking, automatic related work
section generation is a strikingly different prob-
lem and it is much more difficult in comparison
with general multi-document summarization
tasks. For example, multi-document summariza-
tion of news articles aims at synthesizing con-
tents of similar news and removing the redundant
information contained by the different news arti-
cles. However, each scientific paper has much
specific content to state its own work and contri-
bution. Even for the papers that investigate the
same research topic, their contributions and con-
tents can be totally different. The related work
section generation task needs to find the specific
contributions of individual papers and arrange
them into one or several paragraphs.
In this study, we focus on the problem of au-
tomatic related work section generation and pro-
pose a novel system called ARWG to address the

problem. For the target paper, we assume that the
abstract and introduction sections have already
been written by the author and they can be used
to help generate the related work section. For the
reference papers, we only consider and extract
the abstract, introduction, related work and con-
clusion sections, because other sections like the
method and evaluation sections always describe
the extreme details of the specific work and they
are not suitable for this task. Then we generate
the related work section using both sentence sets
which are extracted from the target paper and
reference papers, respectively.
Firstly, we use a PLSA model to group both
sentence sets of the target paper and its reference
papers into different topic-biased clusters. Sec-
ondly, the importance of each sentence in the
target paper and the reference papers is learned
by using two different Support Vector Regres-
sion (SVR) models. At last, a global optimization
framework is proposed to generate the related
work section by selecting sentences from both
the target paper and the reference papers. Mean-
while, the framework selects sentences from dif-
ferent topic-biased clusters globally.
Experimental results on a test set of 150 target
papers show our method can generate related
work sections with better quality than those of
several baseline methods. With the ROUGE
toolkit, the results indicate the related work sec-
tions generated by our system can get higher
ROUGE scores. Moreover, our related work sec-
tions can get higher rating scores based on a user
study. Therefore, our related work sections can
be much more suitable for the authors to prepare
their final related work sections.

There are few studies to directly address auto-
matic related work generation. Hoang and Kan
(2010) proposed a related work summarization
system given the set of keywords arranged in a
hierarchical fashion that describes the paper’s
topic. They used two different rule-based strate-
gies to extract sentences for general topics as
well as detailed ones.
A few studies focus on multi-document scien-
tific article summarization. Agarwal et al., (2011)
introduced an unsupervised approach to the prob-
lem of multi-document summarization. The input
is a list of papers cited together within the same
source article. The key point of this approach is a
topic based clustering of fragments extracted
from each co-cited article. They rank all the clus-
ters using a query generated from the context
surrounding the co-cited list of papers. Yeloglu
et al., (2011) compared four different approaches
for multi-document scientific articles summariza-
tion: MEAD, MEAD with corpus specific vo-
cabulary, LexRank and W3SS.
Other studies investigate mainly on the single-
document scientific article summarization. Early
works including (Luhn 1958; Baxendale 1958;
Edumundson 1969) tried to use various features
specific to scientific text (e.g., sentence position,
or rhetorical clues features). They have proved
that these features are effective for the scientific
article summarization. Citation information has
been already shown effective in summarize the
scientific articles. Works including (Mei and
Zhai 2008; Qazvinian and Radev 2008; Schwartz
and Hearst 2006; Mohammad et al., 2009) em-
ployed citation information for the single scien-
tific article summarization. Earlier work (Nakov
et al., 2004) indicated that citation sentences may
contain important concepts that can give useful
descriptions of a paper.
Various methods have been proposed for news
document summarization, including rule-based
methods (Barzilay and Elhadad 1997; Marcu and
Daniel 1997), graph-based methods (Mani and
Bloedorn 2000; Erkan and Radev 2004; Michal-
cea and Tarau 2005), learning-based methods
(Conroy et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2007; Ouyang
et al., 2007; Galanis et al., 2008), optimization-
based methods (McDonald 2007; Gillick et al.,
2009; Xie et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al.,
2011; Lei Huang et al., 2011; Woodsend et al.,
2012; Galanis 2012), etc.
The most relevant work is (Hoang and Kan,
2010) as mentioned above. They also assumed
the set of reference papers was given as part of
the input. They also adopt the hierarchical topic
tree that describes the topic structure in the target
paper as an essential input for their system.
However, it is non-trivial to build the hierar-
chical topic tree. Moreover, they do not consider
the content of the target paper to construct the
related work section, which is actually crucial in
the related work section. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous works have used super-
vised learning and optimization framework to
deal with the multiple scientific article summari-
zation tasks.

lated work sections. A specific related work ex-
ample is shown in Figure 1.
This related work section introduces previous
related works for a paper on Automatic Taxono-
my Induction. From Figure 1, we can have a
glance at the structure of related work sections.
Related work sections usually discuss several
different topics, such as “pattern-based” and
“cluster-based” approaches shown in the Figure
1. Besides the knowledge of previous works, the
author often compares his own work with the
previous works. The differences and advantages
are generally mentioned. The example in Figure
1 also indicates this phenomenon.
Therefore, we design our system to generate
related work sections according to the related
work section structure mentioned above. Our
system takes the target paper for which a related
work section needs to be drafted besides its ref-
erence papers as input. The goal of our system is
to generate a related work section with the above
structure. The generated related work section
should have several topic-biased parts. The au-
thor&apos;s own work is also needed to be described
and its difference with other works is needed to
be emphasized on.

We build a corpus that contains academic papers
and their corresponding reference papers. The
academic papers are selected from the ACL An-

over 24,500 papers from major conferences such
as ACL, EMNLP, COLING in the fields of com-
putational linguistics and natural language pro-
cessing. We remove the papers that contain relat-
ed work sections with very short length, and ran-
domly select 1050 target papers to construct our
whole corpus.
The papers are all in PDF format. We extract
their texts by using PDFlib 2 and detect their
physical structures of paragraphs, subsections
and sections by using ParsCit3. For the target
papers, the related work sections are directly ex-
tracted as the gold summaries. The references are
also extracted. For the references that can be
found in the ACL Anthology, we download them
from the ACL Anthology. The other reference
papers are searched and downloaded by using
Google Scholar. References to books and PhD
theses are discarded, for their verbosity may
change the problem drastically (Mihalcea and
Ceylan, 2007).
The input of our system includes the abstract
and introduction sections of the target paper, and
the abstract, introduction, related work and con-
clusion sections of the reference papers. As men-
tioned above, the method and evaluation sections
in the reference papers are not used as input be-
cause these sections usually describe extreme
details of the methods and evaluation results and
they are not suitable for related work generation.
Note that it is reasonable to make use of the ab-
stract and introduction sections of the target pa-
per to help generate the related work section,
because an author usually has already written the
abstract and introduction sections before he or
she wants to write the related work section for
the target paper. Otherwise, we cannot get any
information about the author’s own work. All
other sections in the target paper are not used.

ly. The importance scores for sentences in the
target paper and the reference papers are as-
signed by using two SVR based sentence scoring
models. The two SVR models are trained for
sentences in the target paper and the reference
papers, respectively. Meanwhile, a topic model is
applied to the whole set of sentences in both the
target paper and reference papers. The sentences
are grouped into several different topic-biased
clusters. The sentences with importance scores
and topic cluster information are taken as the
input for the global optimization framework. The
optimization framework extracts sentences to
describe both the author’s own work and back-
ground knowledge. More details of each part will
be discussed in the following sections.

As mentioned in the previous section, the related
work section usually addresses several different
topics. The topics may be different research
themes or different aspects of a broad research
theme. The related work section should describe
the specific details for each topic, respectively.
Therefore, we aim to discover the hidden top-
ics of the input papers, and we use the Probabil-
istic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann,
1999) to solve this problem.
The PLSA approach models each word in a
document as a sample from a mixture model.
The mixture components are multinomial ran-
dom variables that can be viewed as representa-
tions of “topics”. Different words in a document
may be generated from different topics. Each
document is represented a list of mixing propor-
tions for these mixture components and can be
reduced to a probability distribution on a fixed
set of topics.
Considering that the sentences in one paper
may relate to different topics, we treat each sen-
tence as a “document” d. We treat the noun
phases in the sentences as the “words” w. In or-
der to extract the noun phrases, chunking imple-
mented by the OpenNLP toolkit 4 is applied to
the sentences. Noun phrases that contain words
such as “paper” and “data” are discarded.
Then the sentences with their corresponding
noun phrases are taken as input into the PLSA
model. Here both the sentences in the target pa-
per and the sentences in the reference papers are
treated the same in the model. Finally, we can
get the sentence set with topic information and
use it in the subsequent steps. Each sentence has
a topic weight t in each topic.

4.3 Sentence Important Assessment

<bodyText confidence="0.999987052631579">
In our proposed system, sentence importance
assessment aims to assign an importance score to
each sentence in the target paper and reference
papers. The score of each sentence will be used
in the subsequent optimization framework. We
propose to use the support vector regression
model to achieve this goal. In the above topic
model learning process, we do not distinguish the
sentences in the target paper and reference pa-
pers. In contrast, we train two different support
vector regression models separately for the sen-
tences in the target paper and the sentences in the
reference papers. In the related work section, the
sentences that describe the author’s own work
usually address the differences from the related
works, while the sentences that describe the re-
lated works often focus on the specific details.
We think the two kinds of sentences should be
treated differently.

Scoring Method

<bodyText confidence="0.999777166666667">
To construct training data based on the papers
collected, we apply a similarity scoring method
to assign the importance scores to the sentences
in the papers. The main hypothesis is that the
sentences in the gold related work sections
should summarize the target paper and reference
papers as well. Thus the sentences in the papers
which are more similar to the sentences in the
gold related work sections should be considered
more important and suitable to be selected. Our
scoring method should assign higher scores to
them.

We define the importance score of a sentence
in the papers as below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.99772">
score(s) = max(sim(s, s� *)) (1)
�� *��*
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992866918367347">
where s is a sentence in the papers, S* is the set
of the sentences in the corresponding gold relat-
ed work section. The standard cosine measure is
employed as the similarity function.
Considering the difference between the sen-
tences that describe the author’s work and the
sentences that describe the related works, we
split the set of sentences in the gold related work
section into two parts: one discusses the author’s
own work and the other introduces the related
works. We observe that sentences related to the
author’s own work often feature specific words
or phrases (such as “we”, “our work”, “in this
paper” etc.) in the related work section. So we
check the sentences about whether they contain
clue words or phrases (i.e., “in this paper”, “our
work” and 18 other phrases). If the clue phrase
check fails, the sentence belongs to the related
work part. If not, it belongs the own work part.
Thus for the sentences in the target paper, S*
is the set of sentences in the own work part of the
gold related work section, while for the sentences
in the reference papers, S* is the set of sentences
in the related work part of the gold related work
section. Then we can use the scoring method to
compute the target scores of the sentences in the
training set. It is noteworthy that two SVR mod-
els can be trained on the two parts of the training
data, respectively.
Feature
Each sentence is represented by a set of features.
The common features used for the sentences of
the target paper and reference papers are shown
in Table 1. The additional features applied to the
sentences of the target paper are introduced in
Table 2.
Here, s is a sentence that needs to extract fea-
tures. th is paper title, section headings and sub-
section headings set of the reference papers or
target paper for the two SVR models, respective-
ly. Each feature with “*” represent a feature set
that contains similar features.
All the features are scaled into [0, 1]. Thus we
can learn SVR models based on the features and
importance scores of the sentences, and then use
the models to predict an importance score for
each sentence in the test set. The SVR models
are trained and applied for the target paper and
reference papers, respectively.

In the above steps, we can get the predicted im-

sentence in the target paper and reference papers.
Here, we introduce a global optimization frame-
work to generate the related work section.
According to the structure of the related work
section mentioned above, the related work sec-
tion usually discusses several topics. In each top-
ic, the related works and their details are intro-
duced. Besides, the author often compares his
own work with these previous works.
Therefore, we propose to formulate the genera-
tion as an optimization problem. Basically, we
will be searching for a set of sentences to opti-
mize the objective function.

<bodyText confidence="0.999861777777778">
To design the objective function, three aspects
should be considered:
1) First, the related work section we generate
should introduce the previous works well. In
our assumption, sentences with higher im-
portance scores are better to be selected. In
addition, very short sentences should be pe-
nalized. So we introduce the first part of our
objective function below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.990707">
∑ (𝑙𝑟𝑖𝑤𝑟𝑖 ∑ 𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑟𝑖𝑗)
𝑛𝑟 𝑚 (2)
𝑖=1 𝑗=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.982603238095238">
We add the sentence length as a multipli-
cation factor in order to penalize the very
short sentences, or the objective function
tends to select more and shorter sentences.
At the same time, the objective function does
not tend to select the very long sentences.
The total length of the sentences selected is
fixed. So if the objective function tends to
select the longer sentences, the fewer sen-
tences can be selected. A tradeoff needs to be
made between the number and the average
length of the sentences selected.
The constraints introduced below ensure
that the sentence can only be selected into
one topic and the topic weight is used to
measure the degree that the sentence is rele-
vant to the specific topic.
2) Second, similar to the first part, we should
consider the own work part of the related
work section. Thus the second part of our ob-
jective function is shown as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.989503333333333">
∑ (𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑤𝑡𝑖 ∑ 𝑡𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑡𝑖𝑗)
𝑛𝑡 𝑚 (3)
𝑖=1 𝑗=1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.800705">
3) At last, redundancy reduction should be con-
sidered in the objective function. The last
part of the objective function is shown below:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.947462333333333">
∑ 𝑐𝑏𝑖𝑦𝑖
|𝐵|
𝑖=1 (4)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.982519142857143">
The intuition is that the more unique bi-
grams the related work section contains, the
less redundancy the related work section has.

All the three parts in the objective function are
normalized to [0, 1] by using the maximum
length 𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥 and the total number of bigrams |𝐵∗|.
𝜆1, 𝜆2 and 𝜆3 are parameters for tuning the three
parts and we set 𝜆1+𝜆2+𝜆3 = 1.
We explain the constraints as follows:
Constraint (6): It ensures that the total word
count of the part of topic j does not exceed 𝐿𝑗.
Constraints (7), (8): The two constraints try to
balance the lengths of the previous works part
and the own work part, respectively. 𝛼 is set to
2/3.
Constraints (9), (10): These two constraints
guarantee that the sentence can only be included
into one topic.

Constraints (11), (12): When these two con-

Constraint (13): This constraint makes sure
that at least one sentence in Sr„ or St„ is select-
ed if bigram b„ is selected.
Therefore, we transform our optimization
problem into a linear programing problem. We
solve this linear programming problem by using
the IBM CPLEX optimizer5. It generally takes
tens of seconds to solve the problem and it is
very efficient.
Finally, ARWG post-processes sentences to
improve readability, including replacing agentive
forms with a citation to the specific article (e.g.,
“our work” → “(Hoang and Kan, 2010)”) for the
sentences extracted from reference papers. The
sentences belonging to different topics are placed
separately.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995948">
To set up our experiments, we divide our dataset
which contains 1050 target papers and their ref-
erence papers into two parts: 700 target papers
for training, 150 papers for test and the other 200
papers for validation. The PLSA topic model is
applied to the whole dataset. We train two SVR
regression models based on the own work part
and the previous work part of the training data
and apply the models to the test data. The global
optimization framework is used to generate the
related work sections. We set the maximum word
count of the generated related work section to be
equal to that of the gold related work section.
The parameter values of A1, A2 and A3 are set to
0.3, 0.1 and 0.6, respectively. The parameter val-
ues are tuned on the validation data.
We compare our system with five baseline sys-
tems: MEAD-WT, LexRank-WT, ARWG-WT,
MEAD and LexRank. MEAD 6 (Radev et al.,
2004) is an open-source extractive multi-
document summarizer. LexRank 7 (Eran and
Radev, 2004) is a multi-document summarization
system which is based on a random walk on the
similarity graph of sentences. We also implement
the MEAD, LexRank baselines and our method

7 In our experiments, LexRank performs much better than
the more complex variant - C-LexRank (Qazvinian and
Radev, 2008), and thus we choose LexRank, rather than C-
LexRank, to represent graph-based summarization methods
for comparison in this paper.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969384615385">
with only the reference papers (i.e. the target pa-
per’s content is not considered). Those methods
are signed by “-WT”.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the SVR mod-
els we employ, we implement a baseline system
RWGOF that uses the random walk scores as the
important scores of the sentences and take the
scores as inputs for the same global optimization
framework as our system to generate the related
work section. The random walk scores are com-
puted for the sentences in the reference papers
and the target paper, respectively.
We use the ROUGE toolkit to evaluate the
content quality of the generated related work sec-
tions. ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is a widely used au-
tomatic summarization evaluation method based
on n-gram comparison. Here, we use the F-
Measure scores of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and
ROUGE-SU4. The model texts are set as the
gold related work sections extracted from the
target papers, and word stemming is utilized.
ROUGE-N is an n-gram based measure between
a candidate text and a reference text. The recall
oriented score, the precision oriented score and
the F-measure score for ROUGE-N are comput-
ed as follows:

where n stands for the length of the n-gram

didate text and a reference text.
In addition, we conducted a user study to sub-
jectively evaluate the related work sections to get
more evidences. We selected the related work
sections generated by different methods for 15
random target papers in the test set. We asked
three human judges to follow an evaluation
guideline we design and evaluate these related
work sections. The human judges are graduate
students in the computer science field and they
did not know the identities of the evaluated relat-
ed work sections. They were asked to give a rat-
ing on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good)
for the correctness, readability and usefulness of
the related work sections, respectively:

The evaluation results over ROUGE metrics are
presented in Table 4. It shows that our proposed
system can get higher ROUGE scores, i.e., better
content quality. In our system, we split the sen-
tence set into different topic-biased parts, and the
importance scores of sentences in the target pa-
per and reference papers are learned differently.
So the obtained importance scores of the sen-
tences are more reliable.
The global optimization framework considers
the extraction of both the previous work part and
the own work part. We can see the importance of
the own work part by comparing the results of
the methods with or without considering the own
work part. MEAD, LexRank and our method all
get a significant improvement after considering
the own work part by extracting sentences from
the target paper. The results also prove our as-
sumption about the related work section structure.
Figure 3 presents the fluctuation of ROUGE
scores when tuning the parameters X1, X2 and X3.
We can see our method generally performs better
than the baselines. All the three parts in the ob-
jective function are useful to generate related
work sections with good quality.
The average scores rated by human judges for
each method are showed in Table 5. We can see
that the related work sections generated by our
system are more related to the target papers.
Moreover, because of the good structure of our
generated related work sections, our generated
related work sections are considered more reada-
ble and more useful for the author to prepare the
final related work sections.
T-test results show that the performance im-
provements of our method over baselines are
statistically significant on both automatic and
manual evaluations. Most of p-values for t-test
are far smaller than 0.01.
Overall, the results indicate that our method
can generate much better related work sections

than the baselines on both automatic and human
evaluations.
Table 6 shows the comparison results between
ARWG and RWGOF. We can see ARWG per-
forms better than RWGOF. It proves that the
SVR models can better estimate the importance
scores of the sentences. For the SVR models are
trained from the large dataset, the sentence
scores predicted by the SVR models can be more
reliable to be used in the global optimization
framework.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975684210526">
This paper proposes a novel system called
ARWG to generate related work sections for ac-
ademic papers. It first exploits a PLSA model to
split the sentence set of the given papers into dif-
ferent topic-biased parts, and then applies regres-
sion models to learn the importance scores of the
sentences. At last an optimization framework is
proposed to generate the related work section.
Evaluation results show that our system can gen-
erate much better related work sections than the
baseline methods.
In future work, we will make use of citation
sentences to improve our system. Citation sen-
tences are the sentences that contains an explicit
reference to another paper and they usually high-
light the most important aspects of the cited pa-
pers. So citation sentences are likely to contain
important and rich information for generating
related work sections.

Experimental results on a test set of 150 target papers show our method can generate related work sections with better quality than those of several baseline methods. With the ROUGE toolkit, the results indicate the related work sections generated by our system can get higher ROUGE scores. Moreover, our related work sections can get higher rating scores based on a user study. Therefore, our related work sections can be much more suitable for the authors to prepare their final related work sections. 2 Related Work There are few studies to directly address automatic related work generation. Hoang and Kan (2010) proposed a related work summarization system given the set of keywords arranged in a hierarchical fashion that describes the paper’s topic. They used two different rule-based strategies to extract sentences for general topics as well as detailed ones. A few studies focus on multi-document scientific article summarization.

Constraint (13): This constraint makes sure that at least one sentence in Sr„ or St„ is selected if bigram b„ is selected. Therefore, we transform our optimization problem into a linear programing problem. We solve this linear programming problem by using the IBM CPLEX optimizer5. It generally takes tens of seconds to solve the problem and it is very efficient. Finally, ARWG post-processes sentences to improve readability, including replacing agentive forms with a citation to the specific article (e.g., “our work” → “(Hoang and Kan, 2010)”) for the sentences extracted from reference papers. The sentences belonging to different topics are placed separately. 5 Evaluation 5.1 Evaluation Setup To set up our experiments, we divide our dataset which contains 1050 target papers and their reference papers into two parts: 700 target papers for training, 150 papers for test and the other 200 papers for validation. The PLSA topic model is applied to the whole dataset. We train two SVR regression models based on the own work part and the previous work part of the training data and apply the models to the test data. The global optimization</context>

The topics may be different research themes or different aspects of a broad research theme. The related work section should describe the specific details for each topic, respectively. Therefore, we aim to discover the hidden topics of the input papers, and we use the Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999) to solve this problem. The PLSA approach models each word in a document as a sample from a mixture model. The mixture components are multinomial random variables that can be viewed as representations of “topics”. Different words in a document may be generated from different topics. Each document is represented a list of mixing proportions for these mixture components and can be reduced to a probability distribution on a fixed set of topics. Considering that the sentences in one paper may relate to different topics, we treat each sentence as a “document” d. We treat the noun phases in the sent</context>

To evaluate the effectiveness of the SVR models we employ, we implement a baseline system RWGOF that uses the random walk scores as the important scores of the sentences and take the scores as inputs for the same global optimization framework as our system to generate the related work section. The random walk scores are computed for the sentences in the reference papers and the target paper, respectively. We use the ROUGE toolkit to evaluate the content quality of the generated related work sections. ROUGE (Lin, 2004) is a widely used automatic summarization evaluation method based on n-gram comparison. Here, we use the FMeasure scores of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-SU4. The model texts are set as the gold related work sections extracted from the target papers, and word stemming is utilized. ROUGE-N is an n-gram based measure between a candidate text and a reference text. The recall oriented score, the precision oriented score and the F-measure score for ROUGE-N are computed as follows: ROUGE − NRecaii G = CS SE{Reference Text}CC GS� gra.n COuntmatch (gramn ) GSE{Reference Text}GgramnCount(gramn) (15) ROUGE</context>

We extract their texts by using PDFlib 2 and detect their physical structures of paragraphs, subsections and sections by using ParsCit3. For the target papers, the related work sections are directly extracted as the gold summaries. The references are also extracted. For the references that can be found in the ACL Anthology, we download them from the ACL Anthology. The other reference papers are searched and downloaded by using Google Scholar. References to books and PhD theses are discarded, for their verbosity may change the problem drastically (Mihalcea and Ceylan, 2007). The input of our system includes the abstract and introduction sections of the target paper, and the abstract, introduction, related work and conclusion sections of the reference papers. As mentioned above, the method and evaluation sections in the reference papers are not used as input because these sections usually describe extreme details of the methods and evaluation results and they are not suitable for related work generation. Note that it is reasonable to make use of the abstract and introduction sections of the target paper to help generate the related work section, because an author</context>

The input is a target academic paper, which has no related work section, along with its reference papers. The goal is to create a related work section that describes the related works and addresses the relationship between the target paper and the reference papers. Here we assume that the set of reference papers has been given as part of the input. Existing works in the NLP and recommendation systems communities have already focused on the task of finding reference papers. For example, citation prediction (Nallapati et al., 2008) aims at finding individual paper citation patterns. Generally speaking, automatic related work section generation is a strikingly different problem and it is much more difficult in comparison with general multi-document summarization tasks. For example, multi-document summarization of news articles aims at synthesizing contents of similar news and removing the redundant information contained by the different news articles. However, each scientific paper has much specific content to state its own work and contribution. Even for the papers that investigate the same research topic, their contrib</context>

Agarwal et al., (2011) introduced an unsupervised approach to the problem of multi-document summarization. The input is a list of papers cited together within the same source article. The key point of this approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each co-cited article. They rank all the clusters using a query generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. Yeloglu et al., (2011) compared four different approaches for multi-document scientific articles summarization: MEAD, MEAD with corpus specific vocabulary, LexRank and W3SS. Other studies investigate mainly on the singledocument scientific article summarization. Early works including (Luhn 1958; Baxendale 1958; Edumundson 1969) tried to use various features specific to scientific text (e.g., sentence position, or rhetorical clues features). They have proved that these features are effective for the scientific article summarization. Citation information has been already shown effective in summarize the scientific ar</context>

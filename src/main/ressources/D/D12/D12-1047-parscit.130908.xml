In this paper, we propose a novel translation
model (TM) based cross-lingual data selec-
tion model for language model (LM) adapta-
tion in statistical machine translation (SMT),
from word models to phrase models. Given
a source sentence in the translation task, this
model directly estimates the probability that
a sentence in the target LM training corpus
is similar. Compared with the traditional ap-
proaches which utilize the first pass translation
hypotheses, cross-lingual data selection mod-
el avoids the problem of noisy proliferation.
Furthermore, phrase TM based cross-lingual
data selection model is more effective than
the traditional approaches based on bag-of-
words models and word-based TM, because
it captures contextual information in model-
ing the selection of phrase as a whole. Ex-
periments conducted on large-scale data set-
s demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on
both LM perplexity and SMT performance.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999736681818182">
Language model (LM) plays a critical role in sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT). It seems to be
a universal truth that LM performance can always
be improved by using more training data (Brants et
al., 2007), but only if the training data is reason-
ably well-matched with the desired output (Moore
and Lewis, 2010). It is also obvious that among the
large training data the topics or domains of discus-
sion will change (Eck et al., 2004), which causes the
mismatch problems with the translation task. For
this reason, most researchers preferred to select sim-
ilar training data from the large training corpus in the
past few years (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004;
Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod et
al., 2011). This would empirically provide more ac-
curate lexical probabilities, and thus better match the
translation task at hand (Axelrod et al., 2011).
Many previous data selection approaches for LM
adaptation in SMT depend on the first pass transla-
tion hypotheses (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004;
Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010), they selec-
t the sentences which are similar to the translation
hypotheses. These schemes are overall limited by
the quality of the translation hypotheses (Tam et al.,
2007 and 2008), and better initial translation hy-
potheses lead to better selected sentences (Zhao et
al., 2004). However, while SMT has achieved a
great deal of development in recent years, the trans-
lation hypotheses are still far from perfect (Wei and
Pal, 2010), which have many noisy data. The noisy
translation hypotheses mislead data selection pro-
cess (Xu et al., 2001; Tam et al., 2006 and 2007;
Wei and Pal, 2010), and thus take noisy data into the
selected training data, which causes noisy prolifera-
tion and degrades the performance of adapted LM.
Furthermore, traditional approaches for LM adap-
tation are based on bag-of-words models and con-
sidered to be context independent, despite of their
state-of-the-art performance, such as TF-IDF (Eck et
al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005;
Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007), centroid simi-
larity (Masskey and Sethy, 2010), and cross-lingual
similarity (CLS) (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011a).
They all perform at the word level, exact only ter-

m matching schemes, and do not take into account
any contextual information when modeling the se-
lection by single words in isolation, which degrade
the quality of selected sentences.
In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to mod-
el the data selection based on the source transla-
tion task directly and capture the contextual infor-
mation for LM adaptation. To this end, we propose
a more principled translation model (TM) based
cross-lingual data selection model for LM adapta-
tion, from word models to phrase models. We as-
sume that the data selection should be performed
by the cross-lingual model and at the phrase lev-
el. Given a source sentence in the translation task,
this model directly estimates the probability before
translation that a sentence in the target LM train-
ing corpus is similar. Therefore, it does not require
the translation task to be pre-translation as in mono-
lingual adaptation, and can address the problem of
noisy proliferation.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
extensive and empirical study of using phrase T-
M based cross-lingual data selection for LM adap-
tation. This model learns the transform probabili-
ty of a multi-term phrase in a source sentence giv-
en a phrase in the target sentence of LM training
corpus. Compared with bag-of-words models and
word-based TM that account for selecting single
words in isolation, this model performs at the phrase
level and captures some contextual information in
modeling the selection of phrase as a whole, thus it
is potentially more effective. More precise data se-
lection can be determined for phrases than for word-
s. In this model, we propose a linear ranking model
framework to further improve the performance, re-
ferred to the linear discriminant function (Duda et
al., 2001; Collins, 2002; Gao et al., 2005) in pattern
classification and information retrieval (IR), where
different models are incorporated as features, as we
will show in our experiments.
Unlike the general TM in SMT, we explore the
use of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea et al., 2004)
to identify and eliminate unimportant words (e.g.,
non-topical words, common words) for corpus pre-
processing, and construct TM by important words.
This reduces the average number of words in cross-
lingual data selection model, thus improving the ef-
ficiency. Moreover, TextRank utilizes the contex-
t information of words to assign term weights (Lee
et al., 2008), which makes phrase TM based cross-
lingual data selection model play its advantage of
capturing the contextual information, thus further
improving the performance.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 introduces the related work of
LM adaptation. Section 3 presents the framework
of cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation.
Section 4 describes our proposed TM based cross-
lingual data selection model: from word models to
phrase models. In section 5 we present large-scale
experiments and analyses, and followed by conclu-
sions and future work in section 6.

TF-IDF and cosine similarity have been widely used
for LM adaptation (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al.,
2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005; Kim, 2005; Foster
and Kuhn, 2007). Masskey and Sethy (2010) se-
lected the auxiliary data by computing centroid sim-
ilarity score to the centroid of the in-domain data.
The main idea of these methods is to select the sen-
tences which are similar to the first pass translation
hypotheses or in-domain corpus from the large LM
training corpus, and estimate the bias LM for SMT
system to improve the translation quality.
Tam et al. (2007 and 2008) proposed a bilingual-
LSA model for LM adaptation. They integrated
the LSA marginal into the target generic LM using
marginal adaptation which minimizes the Kullback-
Leibler divergence between the adapted LM and the
generic LM. Ananthakrishnan et al. (2011a) pro-
posed CLS to bias the count and probability of cor-
responding n-gram through weighting the LM train-
ing corpus. However, these two cross-lingual ap-
proaches focus on modify LM itself, which are d-
ifferent from data selection method for LM adap-
tation. In our comparable experiments, we apply
CLS for the first time to the task of cross-lingual
data selection for LM adaptation. Due to lack of
smoothing measure for sparse vector representation
in CLS, the similarity computation is not accurate
which degrades the performance of adapted LM. To
avoid this, we add smoothing measure like TF-IDF,
called CLS, as we will discuss in the experiments.
Snover et al. (2008) used a word TM based CLIR

system (Xu et al., 2001) to select a subset of tar-
get documents comparable to the source document
for adapting LM. Because of the data sparseness in
the document state and it operated at the document
level, this model selected large quantities of irrele-
vant text, which may degrade the adapted LM (Eck
et al., 2004; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011b). In our
word TM based cross-lingual data selection model,
we operate at the sentence level and add the smooth-
ing mechanism by integrating with the background
word frequency model, and these can significantly
improve the performance. Axelrod et al. (2011)
proposed a bilingual cross-entropy difference to se-
lect data from parallel corpus for domain adaptation
which captures the contextual information slightly,
and outperformed monolingual cross-entropy differ-
ence (Moore and Lewis, 2010), which first shows the
advantage of bilingual data selection. However, its
performance depends on the parallel in-domain cor-
pus which is usually hard to find, and its application
is assumed to be limited.

Our LM adaptation is an unsupervised similar train-
ing data selection guided by TM based cross-lingual
data selection model. For the source sentences in
the translation task, we estimate a new LM, the bias
LM, from the corresponding target LM training sen-
tences which are selected as the similar sentences.
Since the size of the selected sentences is small, the
corresponding bias LM is specific and more effec-
tive, giving high probabilities to those phrases that
occur in the desired output translations.
Following the work of (Zhao et al., 2004; Snover
et al., 2008), the generic LM Pg(wi|h) and the bias
LM Pb(wi|h) are combined using linear interpola-
tion as the adapted LM Pa(wi|h), which is shown to
improve the performance over individual model,

Cross-Lingual Data Selection (CLPTM)
4.2.1 Cross-Lingual Sentence Selection Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947366666667">
The phrase-based TM (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and
Ney, 2004) has shown superior performance com-
pared to the word-based TM. In this paper, the
goal of phrase-based TM is to transfer S into Q.
Rather than transferring single words in isolation,
the phrase model transfers one sequence of word-
s into another sequence of words, thus incorporat-
ing contextual information. Inspired by the work
of web search (Gao et al., 2010) and question re-
trieval in community question answer (Q&amp;A) (Zhou
et al., 2011), we assume the following generative
process: first the sentence S is broken into K non-
empty word sequences w1, ... , wk, then each is
transferred into a new non-empty word sequences
q1, ... , qk, and finally these phrases are permutat-
ed and concatenated to form the sentence Q, where
q and w denote the phrases or consecutive sequence
of words.
To formulate this generative process, let U denote
the segmentation of S into K phrases w1, ... , wk,
and let V denote the K phrases q1, ... , qk, we refer
to these (wz, qz) pairs as bi-phrases. Finally, let M
denote a permutation of K elements representing the
final ranking step.
Next we place a probability distribution over
rewrite pairs. Let B(S, Q) denote the set of U,
V , M triples that transfer S into Q. Here we as-
sume a uniform probability over segmentations, so
the phrase-based selection probability can be formu-
lated as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.76248">
P(Q|S) a 1: P(V |S, U) · P(M|S, U, V )
(U,V,M)E
B(S,Q)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.921847">
Then, we use the maximum approximation to the
sum:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.981628">
P(Q|S) Pz� max
(U,V,M)E
B(S,Q) P(V |S, U) · P(M|S, U, V )
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.99975192">
Although we have defined a generative model for
transferring S into Q, our goal is to calculate the
ranking score function over existing Q and S. How-
ever, this model can not be used directly for sen-
tence ranking because Q and S are often of different
lengths, the length of S is almost 1.5 times to that of
Q in our corpus, leaving many words in S unaligned
to any word in Q. This is another key difference be-
tween our task and SMT. As pointed out by the pre-
vious work (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Gao et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2011), sentence-query selection
requires a distillation of the sentence, while selec-
tion of natural language tolerates little being thrown
away. Thus we restrict our attention to those key sen-
tence words that form the distillation of S, do not
consider the unaligned words in S, and assume that
Q is transfered only from the key sentence words.
In this paper, the key sentence words are identi-
fied via word alignment. Let A = a1 ... aJ be the
”hidden” word alignment, which describes a map-
ping from a term position j in Q to a word position
aj in S. We assume that the positions of the key
sentence words are determined by the Viterbi align-
ment A, which can be obtained using IBM Model 1
(Brown et al., 1993) as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.748473">

Given A, when scoring a given Q/S pair, we re-
strict our attention to those U, V , M triples that are
consistent with A, which we denote as B(S, Q, A).
Here, consistency requires that if two words are
aligned in A, then they must appear in the same bi-
phrase (wZ, qZ). Once the word alignment is fixed,
the final permutation is uniquely determined, so we
can safely discard that factor. Then Equation (11)
can be written as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.993226">
P(V |S, U) (13)

For the sole remaining factor P(V |S, U), we

ring each phrase w1, ... , wk independently, as fol-

Ney, 2004): relative frequency and lexical weight-
ing, and has two format: phrase translation proba-
bility and lexical weight probability.
In order to find the maximum probability assign-
ment P(Q|S) efficiently, we use a dynamic pro-
gramming approach, somewhat similar to the mono-
tone decoding algorithm described in the work (Och,
2002). We consider quantity aj as the maximal
probability of the most likely sequence of phrases
in S covering the first j words in Q, therefore the

However, directly using the phrase-based TM, com-

cation and IR, we therefore propose a linear rank-

and we optimize these parameters using the Pow-

4.3 Eliminating Unimportant Words (EUW)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986756756757">
To improve the efficiency of cross-lingual data se-
lection process, we consider the translation task, the
LM training corpus and the parallel corpus in our
task are constructed by the key words or importan-
t words, and thus construct TM by the key words
or important words, which is another key difference
between our task and SMT. We identify and elimi-
nate unimportant words, somewhat similar to Q&amp;A
retrieval (Lee et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2011). Thus,
the average number of words (the total word number
in Q and 5) in cross-lingual sentence selection mod-
el would be minimized naturally, and the efficiency
of cross-lingual data selection would be improved.
In this paper, we adopt a variant of TextRank
algorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), a graph-
based ranking model for key word extraction which
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. It identifies and
eliminates unimportant words from the corpus, and
assumes that a word is unimportant if it holds a rela-
tively low significance in the corpus. Compared with
the traditional approaches, such as TF-IDF, Tex-
tRank utilizes the context information of words to
assign term weights (Lee et al., 2008), so it further
improves the performance of CLPTM, as we will
show in the experiments.
Following the work of (Lee et al., 2008), the rank-
ing algorithm proceeds as follows. First, all the
words in a given document are added as vertices in
a graph. Then edges are added between words (ver-
tices) if the words co-occur in a fixed-sized window.
The number of co-occurrences becomes the weight
of an edge. When the graph is constructed, the score
of each vertex is initialized as 1, and the PageRank
based ranking algorithm is run on the graph itera-
tively until convergence. The TextRank score Rk wi,D
of a word wi in document D at kth iteration is de-
fined as follows:

We conduct experiments on two Chinese-to-English
translation tasks: IWSLT-07 (dialogue domain) and
NIST-06 (news domain).
IWSLT-07. The bilingual training corpus comes
from BTEC3 and CJK4 corpus, which contain-
s 3.82K sentence pairs with 3.0M/3.1M Chi-
nese/English words. The LM training corpus is from
the English side of the parallel data (BTEC, CJK,
and CWMT20085), which consists of 1.34M sen-
tences and 15.2M English words. The test set is
IWSLT-07 test set which consists of 489 sentences,
and the development set is IWSLT-05 test set which
consists of 506 sentences.
NIST-06. The bilingual training corpus comes
from Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)6, which
consists of 3.4M sentence pairs with 64M/70M Chi-
nese/English words. The LM training corpus is from
the English side of the parallel data as well as the
English Gigaword corpus7, which consists of 11.3M

5.2 Perplexity Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999908166666667">
We randomly divide the development set into five
subsets and conduct 5-fold cross-validation experi-
ments. In each trial, we tune the parameter p in E-
quation (1) and parameter A in Equation (18) with
four of five subsets and then apply it to one re-
maining subset. The experiments reported below are
those averaged over the five trials.
We estimate the generic 4-gram LM with the en-
tire LM training corpus as the baseline. Then, we se-
lect the top-N sentences which are similar to the de-
velopment set, estimate the bias 4-gram LMs (with
n-gram cutoffs tuned as above) with these selected
sentences, and interpolate with the generic 4-gram
LM as the adapted LMs. All the LMs are estimated
by the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). Perplexity is
a metric of LM performance, and the lower perplexi-
ty value indicates the better performance. Therefore,
we estimate the perplexity of adapted LMs accord-
ing to English reference translations.
Figure 1 shows the perplexity of adapted LMs vs.
the size of selected data. In this paper, we choose
TF-IDF as the foundation of our solution since TF-
IDF has gained the state-of-the-art performance for
LM adaptation (Eck et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al.,
2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007). CLS
refers to the cross-lingual similarity of (Ananthakr-
ishnan et al., 2011a), and CLS, is our proposed im-
proved algorithm on CLS with optimization mea-
sure like TF-IDF. CLWTM(Q = 0) refers to S-

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955625">
In this paper, we propose a novel TM based cross-
lingual data selection model for LM adaptation in
SMT, from word models to phrase models, and aims
to find the LM training corpus which are similar to
the translation task at hand. Unlike the general TM
in SMT, we explore the use of TextRank algorithm
to identify and eliminate unimportant words for cor-
pus preprocessing, and construct TM by importan-
t words. Compared with the traditional approach-
es which utilize the first pass translation hypothe-
ses, cross-lingual data selection avoids the prob-
lem of noisy proliferation. Furthermore, phrase T-
M based cross-lingual data selection is more effec-
tive than the traditional approaches based on bag-
of-words models and word-based TM, because it
captures contextual information in modeling the s-
election of phrase as a whole. Large-scale exper-
iments are conducted on LM perplexity and SMT
performance, and the results demonstrate that our
approach solves the two aforementioned disadvan-
tages and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-
art methods for LM adaptation.
There are some ways in which this research could
be continued in the future. First, we will utilize our
approach to mine large-scale corpora by distributed
infrastructure system, and investigate the use of our
approach for other domains, such as speech transla-
tion system. Second, the significant improvement of
LM adaptation based on cross-lingual data selection
is exciting, so it will be instructive to explore oth-
er knowledge based cross-lingual data selection for
LM adaptation, such as latent semantic model.

It is also obvious that among the large training data the topics or domains of discussion will change (Eck et al., 2004), which causes the mismatch problems with the translation task. For this reason, most researchers preferred to select similar training data from the large training corpus in the past few years (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011). This would empirically provide more accurate lexical probabilities, and thus better match the translation task at hand (Axelrod et al., 2011). Many previous data selection approaches for LM adaptation in SMT depend on the first pass translation hypotheses (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010), they select the sentences which are similar to the translation hypotheses. These schemes are overall limited by the quality of the translation hypotheses (Tam et al., 2007 and 2008), and better initial translation hypotheses lead to better selected sentences (Zhao et</context>

Because of the data sparseness in the document state and it operated at the document level, this model selected large quantities of irrelevant text, which may degrade the adapted LM (Eck et al., 2004; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011b). In our word TM based cross-lingual data selection model, we operate at the sentence level and add the smoothing mechanism by integrating with the background word frequency model, and these can significantly improve the performance. Axelrod et al. (2011) proposed a bilingual cross-entropy difference to select data from parallel corpus for domain adaptation which captures the contextual information slightly, and outperformed monolingual cross-entropy difference (Moore and Lewis, 2010), which first shows the advantage of bilingual data selection. However, its performance depends on the parallel in-domain corpus which is usually hard to find, and its application is assumed to be limited. 3 Cross-Lingual Data Selection for Language Model Adaptation Our LM adaptation is an unsupervised similar training data selection guided by TM based cross-lingu</context>

However, this model can not be used directly for sentence ranking because Q and S are often of different lengths, the length of S is almost 1.5 times to that of Q in our corpus, leaving many words in S unaligned to any word in Q. This is another key difference between our task and SMT. As pointed out by the previous work (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Gao et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011), sentence-query selection requires a distillation of the sentence, while selection of natural language tolerates little being thrown away.

Experiments conducted on large-scale data sets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both LM perplexity and SMT performance. 1 Introduction Language model (LM) plays a critical role in statistical machine translation (SMT). It seems to be a universal truth that LM performance can always be improved by using more training data (Brants et al., 2007), but only if the training data is reasonably well-matched with the desired output (Moore and Lewis, 2010).

Thus we restrict our attention to those key sentence words that form the distillation of S, do not consider the unaligned words in S, and assume that Q is transfered only from the key sentence words. In this paper, the key sentence words are identified via word alignment. Let A = a1 ... aJ be the ”hidden” word alignment, which describes a mapping from a term position j in Q to a word position aj in S. We assume that the positions of the key sentence words are determined by the Viterbi alignment A, which can be obtained using IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) as follows: A� = arg maxP(Q, A|S) A IP(qj|waj) J 1arg maxP(qj|waj)1j=1(12) aj = arg max { J A P(J|I) j=1 515 Given A, when scoring a given Q/S pair, we restrict our attention to those U, V , M triples that are consistent with A, which we denote as B(S, Q, A). Here, consistency requires that if two words are aligned in A, then they must appear in the same biphrase (wZ, qZ). Once the word alignment is fixed, the final permutation is uniquely determined, so we can safely discard that factor. Then Equation (11) can be written as P(V |S, U) (13) For the sole remaining factor P(V |S, U), we assume </context>

We use these adapted LMs for next translation experiments to show the detailed performance of selected training data for LM adaptation. 5.3 Translation Experiments We carry out translation experiments on the test set by hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) SMT (Chiang, 2005 and 2007) system to demonstrate the utility of LM adaptation on improving SMT performance by BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002).

Compared with bag-of-words models and word-based TM that account for selecting single words in isolation, this model performs at the phrase level and captures some contextual information in modeling the selection of phrase as a whole, thus it is potentially more effective. More precise data selection can be determined for phrases than for words. In this model, we propose a linear ranking model framework to further improve the performance, referred to the linear discriminant function (Duda et al., 2001; Collins, 2002; Gao et al., 2005) in pattern classification and information retrieval (IR), where different models are incorporated as features, as we will show in our experiments. Unlike the general TM in SMT, we explore the use of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea et al., 2004) to identify and eliminate unimportant words (e.g., non-topical words, common words) for corpus preprocessing, and construct TM by important words.

It seems to be a universal truth that LM performance can always be improved by using more training data (Brants et al., 2007), but only if the training data is reasonably well-matched with the desired output (Moore and Lewis, 2010). It is also obvious that among the large training data the topics or domains of discussion will change (Eck et al., 2004), which causes the mismatch problems with the translation task. For this reason, most researchers preferred to select similar training data from the large training corpus in the past few years (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011). This would empirically provide more accurate lexical probabilities, and thus better match the translation task at hand (Axelrod et al., 2011). Many previous data selection approaches for LM adaptation in SMT depend on the first pass translation hypotheses (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Kim, 2005; Massk</context>

The noisy translation hypotheses mislead data selection process (Xu et al., 2001; Tam et al., 2006 and 2007; Wei and Pal, 2010), and thus take noisy data into the selected training data, which causes noisy proliferation and degrades the performance of adapted LM. Furthermore, traditional approaches for LM adaptation are based on bag-of-words models and considered to be context independent, despite of their state-of-the-art performance, such as TF-IDF (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007), centroid similarity (Masskey and Sethy, 2010), and cross-lingual similarity (CLS) (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011a).

To avoid this, we add smoothing measure like TF-IDF, called CLS, as we will discuss in the experiments. Snover et al. (2008) used a word TM based CLIR 513 system (Xu et al., 2001) to select a subset of target documents comparable to the source document for adapting LM. Because of the data sparseness in the document state and it operated at the document level, this model selected large quantities of irrelevant text, which may degrade the adapted LM (Eck et al., 2004; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011b). In our word TM based cross-lingual data selection model, we operate at the sentence level and add the smoothing mechanism by integrating with the background word frequency model, and these can significantly improve the performance. Axelrod et al. (2011) proposed a bilingual cross-entropy difference to select data from parallel corpus for domain adaptation which captures the contextual information slightly, and outperformed monolingual cross-entropy difference (Moore and Lewis, 2010), which first shows the advantage of bilingual data selection.

Perplexity is a metric of LM performance, and the lower perplexity value indicates the better performance. Therefore, we estimate the perplexity of adapted LMs according to English reference translations. Figure 1 shows the perplexity of adapted LMs vs. the size of selected data. In this paper, we choose TF-IDF as the foundation of our solution since TFIDF has gained the state-of-the-art performance for LM adaptation (Eck et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007).

In this paper, the goal of phrase-based TM is to transfer S into Q. Rather than transferring single words in isolation, the phrase model transfers one sequence of words into another sequence of words, thus incorporating contextual information. Inspired by the work of web search (Gao et al., 2010) and question retrieval in community question answer (Q&amp;A) (Zhou et al., 2011), we assume the following generative process: first the sentence S is broken into K nonempty word sequences w1, ... , wk, then each is transferred into a new non-empty word sequences q1, ... , qk, and finally these phrases are permutated and concatenated to form the sentence Q, where q and w denote the phrases or consecutive sequence of words.

However, this model can not be used directly for sentence ranking because Q and S are often of different lengths, the length of S is almost 1.5 times to that of Q in our corpus, leaving many words in S unaligned to any word in Q. This is another key difference between our task and SMT. As pointed out by the previous work (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Gao et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011), sentence-query selection requires a distillation of the sentence, while selection of natural language tolerates little being thrown away. Thus we restrict our attention to those key sentence words that form the distillation of S, do not consider the unaligned words in S, and assume that Q is transfered only from the key sentence words. In this paper, the key sentence words are identified via word alignment. Let A = a1 ... aJ be the ”hidden” word alignment, which describes a mapping from a term position j in Q to a word position aj in S. We assume that the positions of the</context>

It seems to be a universal truth that LM performance can always be improved by using more training data (Brants et al., 2007), but only if the training data is reasonably well-matched with the desired output (Moore and Lewis, 2010). It is also obvious that among the large training data the topics or domains of discussion will change (Eck et al., 2004), which causes the mismatch problems with the translation task. For this reason, most researchers preferred to select similar training data from the large training corpus in the past few years (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011).

Here, β is interpolation weight; notice that letting β = 0 in Equation (8) reduces the model to the un-smoothed model in Equation (4). 4.2 Phrase-Based Translation Model for Cross-Lingual Data Selection (CLPTM) 4.2.1 Cross-Lingual Sentence Selection Model The phrase-based TM (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) has shown superior performance compared to the word-based TM. In this paper, the goal of phrase-based TM is to transfer S into Q. Rather than transferring single words in isolation, the phrase model transfers one sequence of words into another sequence of words, thus incorporating contextual information. Inspired by the work of web search (Gao et al., 2010) and question retrieval in community question answer (Q&amp;A) (Zhou et al., 2011), we assume the following generative process: first the sentence S is broken into K nonempty word sequences w1, ... , wk, then each is transfe</context>

Once the word alignment is fixed, the final permutation is uniquely determined, so we can safely discard that factor. Then Equation (11) can be written as P(V |S, U) (13) For the sole remaining factor P(V |S, U), we assume that a segmented queried question V = q1, ... , qk is generated from left to right by transferring each phrase w1, ... , wk independently, as follows: K P(V |S, U) = H P(qk|wk) (14) k=1 where P(qk|wk) is a phrase translation probability computed from the parallel corpus, which can be estimated in two ways (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004): relative frequency and lexical weighting, and has two format: phrase translation probability and lexical weight probability. In order to find the maximum probability assignment P(Q|S) efficiently, we use a dynamic programming approach, somewhat similar to the monotone decoding algorithm described in the work (Och, 2002).

Unlike the general TM in SMT, we explore the use of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea et al., 2004) to identify and eliminate unimportant words (e.g., non-topical words, common words) for corpus preprocessing, and construct TM by important words. This reduces the average number of words in crosslingual data selection model, thus improving the efficiency. Moreover, TextRank utilizes the context information of words to assign term weights (Lee et al., 2008), which makes phrase TM based crosslingual data selection model play its advantage of capturing the contextual information, thus further improving the performance.

We identify and eliminate unimportant words, somewhat similar to Q&amp;A retrieval (Lee et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2011).

Experiments conducted on large-scale data sets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both LM perplexity and SMT performance. 1 Introduction Language model (LM) plays a critical role in statistical machine translation (SMT). It seems to be a universal truth that LM performance can always be improved by using more training data (Brants et al., 2007), but only if the training data is reasonably well-matched with the desired output (Moore and Lewis, 2010). It is also obvious that among the large training data the topics or domains of discussion will change (Eck et al., 2004), which causes the mismatch problems with the translation task.

In our word TM based cross-lingual data selection model, we operate at the sentence level and add the smoothing mechanism by integrating with the background word frequency model, and these can significantly improve the performance. Axelrod et al. (2011) proposed a bilingual cross-entropy difference to select data from parallel corpus for domain adaptation which captures the contextual information slightly, and outperformed monolingual cross-entropy difference (Moore and Lewis, 2010), which first shows the advantage of bilingual data selection. However, its performance depends on the parallel in-domain corpus which is usually hard to find, and its application is assumed to be limited. 3 Cross-Lingual Data Selection for Language Model Adaptation Our LM adaptation is an unsupervised similar training data selection guided by TM based cross-lingual data selection model. For the source sentences in the translation task, we estimate a new LM, the bias LM, from the corresponding target LM training sentences which are selected as the similar sentences.

In this paper, the goal of phrase-based TM is to transfer S into Q. Rather than transferring single words in isolation, the phrase model transfers one sequence of words into another sequence of words, thus incorporating contextual information. Inspired by the work of web search (Gao et al., 2010) and question retrieval in community question answer (Q&amp;A) (Zhou et al., 2011), we assume the following generative process: first the sentence S is broken into K nonempty word sequences w1, ... , wk, then each is transferred into a new non-</context>

Once the word alignment is fixed, the final permutation is uniquely determined, so we can safely discard that factor. Then Equation (11) can be written as P(V |S, U) (13) For the sole remaining factor P(V |S, U), we assume that a segmented queried question V = q1, ... , qk is generated from left to right by transferring each phrase w1, ... , wk independently, as follows: K P(V |S, U) = H P(qk|wk) (14) k=1 where P(qk|wk) is a phrase translation probability computed from the parallel corpus, which can be estimated in two ways (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004): relative frequency and lexical weighting, and has two format: phrase translation probability and lexical weight probability. In order to find the maximum probability assignment P(Q|S) efficiently, we use a dynamic programming approach, somewhat similar to the monotone decoding algorithm described in the work (Och, 2002). We consider quantity aj as the maximal probability of the most likely sequence of phrases in S covering the first j words in Q, therefore the probability can be calculated using the following recursion: step (1).

An for n = 1... N is the corresponding parameters of each feature, and we optimize these parameters using the Powell Search algorithm (Press et al., 1992) via crossvalidation.

However, these two cross-lingual approaches focus on modify LM itself, which are different from data selection method for LM adaptation. In our comparable experiments, we apply CLS for the first time to the task of cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation. Due to lack of smoothing measure for sparse vector representation in CLS, the similarity computation is not accurate which degrades the performance of adapted LM. To avoid this, we add smoothing measure like TF-IDF, called CLS, as we will discuss in the experiments. Snover et al. (2008) used a word TM based CLIR 513 system (Xu et al., 2001) to select a subset of target documents comparable to the source document for adapting LM. Because of the data sparseness in the document state and it operated at the document level, this model selected large quantities of irrelevant text, which may degrade the adapted LM (Eck et al., 2004; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011b). In our word TM based cross-lingual data selection model, we operate at the sentence level and add the smoothing mechanism by integrating with the background word frequency model, and these can significantly improve the pe</context>

Since the size of the selected sentences is small, the corresponding bias LM is specific and more effective, giving high probabilities to those phrases that occur in the desired output translations.

Masskey and Sethy (2010) selected the auxiliary data by computing centroid similarity score to the centroid of the in-domain data. The main idea of these methods is to select the sentences which are similar to the first pass translation hypotheses or in-domain corpus from the large LM training corpus, and estimate the bias LM for SMT system to improve the translation quality.

Because of the data sparseness in the document state and it operated at the document level, this model selected large quantities of irrelevant text, which may degrade the adapted LM (Eck et al., 2004; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011b). In our word TM based cross-lingual data selection model, we operate at the sentence level and add the smoothing mechanism by integrating with the background word frequency model, and these can significantly improve the performance.

By Bayes’ rule, P(S)P(Q|S) P(S|Q) = (2) P(Q) where the prior probability P(S) can be viewed as uniform, and the P(Q) is constant across all sentences. Therefore, selecting a sentence to maximize P(S|Q) is equivalent to selecting a sentence that maximizes P(Q|S). 4.1 Word-Based Translation Model for Cross-Lingual Data Selection (CLWTM) 4.1.1 Cross-Lingual Sentence Selection Model Following the work of (Xu et al., 2001; Snover et al., 2008), CLWTM can be described as P(Q|S) = � P(q|S) (3) qEQ P(q|S) = αP(q|Cq) + (1− α) � P(q|w)P(w|S) wES (4) where α is the interpolation weight empirically set as a constant1, P(q|w) is the word-based TM which is estimated by IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) from the parallel corpus, P(q|Cq) and P(w|S) are the un-smoothed background and sentence model, respectively, estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) as P(q|Cq) = freq(q, Cq) (5) |Cq| P(w|S) = freq(w, S) (6) |S| where Cq refers to the translation task, freq(q, Cq) refers to the number of times q occurs in Cq, </context>

It seems to be a universal truth that LM performance can always be improved by using more training data (Brants et al., 2007), but only if the training data is reasonably well-matched with the desired output (Moore and Lewis, 2010). It is also obvious that among the large training data the topics or domains of discussion will change (Eck et al., 2004), which causes the mismatch problems with the translation task. For this reason, most researchers preferred to select similar training data from the large training corpus in the past few years (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011). This would empirically provide more accurate lexical probabilities, and thus better match the translation task at hand (Axelrod et al., 2011). Many previous data selection approaches for LM adaptation in SMT depend on the first pass translation hypotheses (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010), they select the sentences which are similar to the translation hypotheses. These schemes are overall limited by the quality of the translation hypotheses (Tam et al., 2007 and 2008), and better initial transl</context>

The noisy translation hypotheses mislead data selection process (Xu et al., 2001; Tam et al., 2006 and 2007; Wei and Pal, 2010), and thus take noisy data into the selected training data, which causes noisy proliferation and degrades the performance of adapted LM. Furthermore, traditional approaches for LM adaptation are based on bag-of-words models and considered to be context independent, despite of their state-of-the-art performance, such as TF-IDF (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007), centroid similarity (Masskey and Sethy, 2010), and cross-lingual similarity (CLS) (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011a).

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work of LM adaptation. Section 3 presents the framework of cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation. Section 4 describes our proposed TM based crosslingual data selection model: from word models to phrase models. In section 5 we present large-scale experiments and analyses, and followed by conclusions and future work in section 6. 2 Related Work TF-IDF and cosine similarity have been widely used for LM adaptation (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007). Masskey and Sethy (2010) selected the auxiliary data by computing centroid similarity score to the centroid of the in-domain data. The main idea of these methods is to select the sentences which are similar to the first pass translation hypotheses or in-domain corpus from the large LM training corpus, and estimate the bias LM for SMT system to improve the translation quality. Tam et al. (2007 and 2008) proposed a bilingualLSA model for LM adaptation. They integrated the LSA marginal into the target generic LM using marginal adaptati</context>

For the source sentences in the translation task, we estimate a new LM, the bias LM, from the corresponding target LM training sentences which are selected as the similar sentences. Since the size of the selected sentences is small, the corresponding bias LM is specific and more effective, giving high probabilities to those phrases that occur in the desired output translations. Following the work of (Zhao et al., 2004; Snover et al., 2008), the generic LM Pg(wi|h) and the bias LM Pb(wi|h) are combined using linear interpolation as the adapted LM Pa(wi|h), which is shown to improve the performance over individual model, Pa(wi|h) = µPg(wi|h) + (1 − µ)Pb(wi|h) (1) where the interpolation factor µ can be simply estimated using the Powell Search algorithm (Press et al., 1992) via cross-validation. Our work focuses on TM based cross-lingual data selection model, from word model to phrase models, and the quality of this model is crucial to the performance of adapted LM. 4 Translation Model for Cross-Lingual Data </context>

In this paper, the goal of phrase-based TM is to transfer S into Q. Rather than transferring single words in isolation, the phrase model transfers one sequence of words into another sequence of words, thus incorporating contextual information. Inspired by the work of web search (Gao et al., 2010) and question retrieval in community question answer (Q&amp;A) (Zhou et al., 2011), we assume the following generative process: first the sentence S is broken into K nonempty word sequences w1, ... , wk, then each is transferred into a new non-empty word sequences q1, ... , qk, and finally these phrases are permutated and concatenated to form the sentence Q, where q and w denote the phrases or consecutive sequence of words. To formulate this generative process, let U denote the segmentation of S into K phrases w1, ... , wk, and let V denote the K phrases q1, ... , qk, we refer to these (wz, qz) pairs as bi-phrases. Finally, let M denote a permutation of K elements represent</context>

However, this model can not be used directly for sentence ranking because Q and S are often of different lengths, the length of S is almost 1.5 times to that of Q in our corpus, leaving many words in S unaligned to any word in Q. This is another key difference between our task and SMT. As pointed out by the previous work (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Gao et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011), sentence-query selection requires a distillation of the sentence, while selection of natural language tolerates little being thrown away. Thus we restrict our attention to those key sentence words that form the distillation of S, do not consider the unaligned words in S, and assume that Q is transfered only from the key sentence words. In this paper, the key sentence words are identified via word alignment. Let A = a1 ... aJ be the ”hidden” word alignment, which describes a mapping from a term position j in Q to a word position aj in S. We assume that the positions of the key sentence words </context>

We identify and eliminate unimportant words, somewhat similar to Q&amp;A retrieval (Lee et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2011). Thus, the average number of words (the total word number in Q and 5) in cross-lingual sentence selection model would be minimized naturally, and the efficiency of cross-lingual data selection would be improved. In this paper, we adopt a variant of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), a graphbased ranking model for key word extraction which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. It identifies and eliminates unimportant words from the corpus, and assumes that a word is unimportant if it holds a relatively low significance in the corpus.

This paper proposes a novel method for lex-
icon extraction that extracts translation pairs
from comparable corpora by using graph-
based label propagation. In previous work,
it was established that performance drasti-
cally decreases when the coverage of a seed
lexicon is small. We resolve this problem
by utilizing indirect relations with the bilin-
gual seeds together with direct relations, in
which each word is represented by a distri-
bution of translated seeds. The seed distri-
butions are propagated over a graph repre-
senting relations among words, and transla-
tion pairs are extracted by identifying word
pairs with a high similarity in the seed dis-
tributions. We propose two types of the
graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing
co-occurrence relations between words, and
a similarity graph, representing context sim-
ilarities between words. Evaluations using
English and Japanese patent comparable cor-
pora show that our proposed graph propaga-
tion method outperforms conventional meth-
ods. Further, the similarity graph achieved im-
proved performance by clustering synonyms
into the same translation.

Bilingual lexicons are important resources for bilin-
gual tasks such as machine translation (MT) and
cross-language information retrieval (CLIR). There-
fore, the automatic building of bilingual lexicons
from corpora is one of the issues that have attracted
many researchers. As a solution, a number of pre-
vious works proposed extracting bilingual lexicons

from comparable corpora, in which documents were
not direct translations but shared a topic or domain1.
The use of comparable corpora is motivated by the
fact that large parallel corpora are only available for
a few language pairs and for limited domains.
Most of the previous methods are based on as-
sumption (I), that a word and its translation tend to
appear in similar contexts across languages (Rapp,
1999). Based on this assumption, many methods
calculate word similarity using context and then ex-
tract word translation pairs with a high-context sim-
ilarity. We call these methods context-similarity-
based methods. The context similarities are usu-
ally computed using a seed bilingual lexicon (e.g.
a general bilingual dictionary) by mapping contexts
expressed in two different languages into the same
space. In the mapping, information not represented
by the seed lexicon is discarded. Therefore, the
context-similarity-based methods could not find ac-
curate translation pairs if using a small seed lexicon.
Some of the previous methods tried to alleviate
the problem of the limited seed lexicon size (Koehn
and Knight, 2002; Morin and Prochasson, 2011;
Hazem et al., 2011), while others did not require any
seed lexicon (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995; Haghighi et
al., 2008; Ismail and Manandhar, 2010; Daum´e III
and Jagarlamudi, 2011). However, they suffer the
problems of high computational cost (Rapp, 1995),
sensitivity to parameters (Hazem et al., 2011),
low accuracy (Fung, 1995; Ismail and Manandhar,
2010), and ineffectiveness for language pairs with

different types of characters (Koehn and Knight,
2002; Haghighi et al., 2008; Daum´e III and Jagar-
lamudi, 2011).
In face of the above problems, we propose a novel
method that uses a graph-based label propagation
technique (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002). The pro-
posed method is based on assumption (II), which is
derived by recursively applying assumption (I) to the
“contexts”: a word and its translation tend to have
similar co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations
with all bilingual seeds across languages.
Based on assumption (II), we propose a three-
step approach: (1) constructing a graph for each
language with each edge indicating a direct co-
occurrence relation, (2) representing every word as a
seed translation distribution by iteratively propagat-
ing translated seeds in each graph, (3) finding two
words in different languages with a high similarity
with respect to the seed distributions. By propagat-
ing all the seeds on the graph, indirect co-occurrence
relations are also considered when computing bilin-
gual relations, which have been neglected in previ-
ous methods. In addition to the co-occurrence-based
graph construction, we propose a similarity graph,
which also takes into account context similarities be-
tween words.
The main contributions of this paper are as fol-
lows:
• We propose a bilingual lexicon extraction
method that captures co-occurrence relations
with all the seeds, including indirect rela-
tions, using graph-based label propagation.
In our experiments, we confirm that the
proposed method outperforms conventional
context-similarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999;
Andrade et al., 2010), and works well even if
the coverage of a seed lexicon is low.
• We propose a similarity graph which represents
context similarities between words. In our ex-
periments, we confirm that a similarity graph
is more effective than a co-occurrence-based
graph.

2 Context-Similarity-based Extraction
Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98681948">
The bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable
corpora was pioneered in (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995).
The popular similarity-based methods consist of the
following steps: modeling contexts, calculating con-
text similarities, and finding translation pairs.
Step 1. Modeling contexts: The context of each
word is generally modeled by a vector where each
dimension corresponds to a context word and each
dimension has a value indicating occurrence cor-
relation. Various definitions for the context have
been used: distance-based context (e.g. in a sen-
tence (Laroche and Langlais, 2010), in a para-
graph (Fung and McKeown, 1997), in a predefined
window (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010)), and
syntactic-based context (e.g. predecessors and suc-
cessors in dependency trees (Garera et al., 2009),
certain dependency position (Otero and Campos,
2008)). Some treated context words equally re-
gardless of their positions (Fung and Yee, 1998),
while others treated the words separately for each
position (Rapp, 1999). Various correlation mea-
sures have been used: log-likelihood ratio (Rapp,
1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002), tf-idf (Fung
and Yee, 1998), pointwise mutual information
(PMI) (Andrade et al., 2010), context heterogene-
ity (Fung, 1995), etc.
Shao and Ng (2004) represented contexts using
language models. Andrade et al. (2010) used a
set of words with a positive association as a con-
text. Andrade et al. (2011a) used dependency re-
lations instead of context words. Ismail and Man-
andhar (2010) used only in-domain words in con-
texts. Pekar et al. (2006) constructed smoothed con-
text vectors for rare words. Laws et al. (2010) used
graphs in which vertices correspond to words and
edges indicate three types of syntactic relations such
as adjectival modification.
Step 2. Calculating context similarities: The con-
texts which are expressed in two different languages
are mapped into the same space. Previous methods
generally use a seed bilingual lexicon for this map-
ping. After that, similarities are calculated based
on the mapped context vectors using various mea-
sures: city-block metric (Rapp, 1999), cosine sim-
ilarity (Fung and Yee, 1998), weighted jaccard in-
dex (Hazem et al., 2011), Jensen-Shannon diver-
gence (Pekar et al., 2006), the number of overlap-
ping context words (Andrade et al., 2010), Sim-
Rank (Laws et al., 2010), euclidean distance (Fung,
1995), etc.

Andrade et al. (2011b) performed a linear trans-
formation of context vectors in accordance with the
notion that importance varies by context positions.
Gaussier et al. (2004) mapped context vectors via
latent classes to capture synonymy and polysemy in
a seed lexicon. Fiˇser et al. (2011) and Kaji (2005)
calculated 2-way similarities.
Step 3. Finding translation pairs: A pair of words
is treated as a translation pair when their context
similarity is high. Various clues have been con-
sidered when computing the similarities: concept
class information obtained from a multilingual the-
saurus (D´ejean et al., 2002), co-occurrence models
generated from aligned documents (Prochasson and
Fung, 2011), and transliteration information (Shao
and Ng, 2004).

2.1 Problems from Previous Works
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971102040817">
Most of previous methods used a seed bilingual lex-
icon for mapping modeled contexts in two different
languages into the same space. The mapping heav-
ily relies on the entries in a given bilingual lexicon.
Therefore, if the coverage of the seed lexicon is low,
the context vectors become sparser and its discrim-
inative capability becomes lower, leading to extrac-
tion of incorrect translation equivalents.
Consider the example in Figure 1, where a
context-similarity-based method and our proposed
method find translation equivalents of the Japanese
word “1=°7=--7 (piranha)”. There are three con-
text words for the query. However, the informa-
tion on co-occurrence with “A* (freshwater)” dis-
appears after the context vector is mapped, because
the seed lexicon does not include “A* (freshwa-
ter)”. The same thing happens with the English word
“piranha”. As a result, the pair of “1=°7=--7 (pi-
ranha)” and “anaconda” could be wrongly identified
as a translation pair.
Some previous work focused on the problem
of seed lexicon limitation. Morin and Prochas-
son (2011) complemented the seed lexicon with
bilingual lexicon extracted from parallel sentences.
Koehn and Knight (2002) used identically-spelled
words in two languages as a seed lexicon. However,
the method is not applicable for language pairs with
different types of characters such as English and
Japanese. Hazem et al. (2011) exploited k-nearest
words for a query, which is very sensitive to the pa-
rameter k.
Some previous work did not require any seed lex-
icon. Rapp (1995) proposed a computationally de-
manding matrix permutation method which maxi-
mizes a similarity between co-occurrence matrices
in two languages. Ismail and Manandhar (2010) in-
troduced a similarity measure between two words in
different languages without requiring any seed lex-
icon. Fung (1995) used context heterogeneity vec-
tors where each dimension is independent on lan-
guage types. However, their performances are worse
than those of conventional methods using a small
seed lexicon. Haghighi et al. (2008) and Daum´e
III and Jagarlamudi (2011) proposed a generative
model based on probabilistic canonical correlation
analysis, where words are represented by context
features and orthographic features2. However, their
experiments showed that orthographic features to be

As described in Section 2, the performance of previ-
ous work is significantly degraded when used with a
small seed lexicon. This problem could be resolved
by incorporating indirect relations with all the seeds
when identifying translation pairs. For example, in
Figure 1, “1=°7=--7 (piranha)” has some degree of
association with the seed “A - fish” through “A*
(freshwater)” in both the Japanese side and the En-
glish side, although “1=°7=--7 (piranha)” and “A
(fish)” do not co-occur in the same contexts. More-
over, “anaconda” has very little association with the
seed “A - fish” in the English side. Therefore,
the indirect relation with the seed “A - fish” helps
to discriminate from between “piranha” and “ana-
conda” and could be an important clue for identify-
ing a correct translation pair.
To utilize indirect relations, we introduce assump-
tion (II): a word and its translation tend to have simi-
lar co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with
all bilingual seeds across languages3. Based on as-
sumption (II), we propose to identify a word pair as
a translation pair when its co-occurrence (direct and
indirect) relations with all the seeds are similar.
To obtain co-occurrence relations with all the
seeds, including indirect relations, we focus on a
graph-based label propagation (LP) technique (Zhu
and Ghahramani, 2002). LP transfers labels from
labeled data points to unlabeled data points. In the
process, all vertices have soft labels that can be inter-
preted as label distributions. We apply LP to bilin-
gual lexicon extraction by representing each word as
a vertex in a graph with each edge encoding a direct
co-occurrence relation. Translated seeds are propa-
gated as labels, and seed distributions are obtained
for each word. From the seed distributions, we iden-
tify translation pairs.
In summary, our proposed method consists of
three steps (see Algorithm 1): (1) graph construc-
3Assumption (I) indicates direct co-occurrence relations be-
tween a word and its context words are preserved across differ-
ent languages. Therefore, assumption (II) is derived by recur-
sively applying assumption (I) to the “context words”.

We construct a graph representing the association
between words for each language. Each graph is an
undirected graph because the association does not
have direction. The graphs are constructed as fol-
lows:
Step 1. Vertex assignment extracts words from
each corpus, and assigns a vertex to each of the ex-
tracted words. Let V = {v1, · · · , vn} be a set of
vertices.
Step 2. Edge weight calculation calculates associ-
ation strength between two words as the weights of
edges. Let E and W be a set of edges and that of
the weights respectively, and eij ∈ E links vi and
vj, and wij ∈ W is the weight of eij. Note that
|E |= |W|.
Step 3. Edge pruning excludes edges whose
weights are lower than threshold, in order to reduce
the computational cost during seed propagations.
We propose two types of graphs that differ in the
association measure used in Step 2: a co-occurrence
graph and a similarity graph4.

<bodyText confidence="0.980026774193548">
Co-occurrence graphs are very sensitive to ac-
cidental relation caused by lower frequent co-
occurrence. Thus, we propose a similarity graph
where context similarities are employed as weights
of edges instead of simple co-occurrence-based cor-
relations. Since the context similarities are com-
puted by the global correlation among words which
co-occur, a similarity graph is less subject to acci-
dental co-occurrence. The use of a similarity graph
is inspired by assumption (III): a word and its trans-
lation tend to have similar context similarities with
all bilingual seeds across languages5.
In edge weight calculation, we first construct a
correlation vector representing co-occurrence rela-
tions for each word. The correlation vectors are con-
structed in the same way as the context vectors used
in context-similarity-based methods (see Section 2),
where context words are words in a predefined win-
dow (window size is 4 in our experiment), the as-
sociation measure is PMI, and context words are
treated separately for each position. A correlation
vector for each position is computed separately, then
concatenated into a single vector within the window.
Secondly, we calculate similarities between correla-
tion vectors. There are various similarity measures
that can be used, and cosine similarity is used in this

3.2 Seed Propagation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999954181818182">
LP is a graph-based technique which transfers the
labels from labeled data to unlabeled data in or-
der to infer labels for unlabeled data. This is pri-
marily used when there is scarce labeled data but
abundant unlabeled data. LP has been success-
fully applied in common natural language process-
ing tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Niu
et al., 2005; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007),
multi-class lexicon acquisition (Alexandrescu and
Kirchhoff, 2007), and part-of-speech tagging (Das
and Petrov, 2011). LP iteratively propagates la-
bel information from any vertex to nearby vertices
through weighted edges, and then a label distribu-
tion for each vertex is generated where the weights
of all labels add up to 1.
We adopt LP to obtain relations with all bilingual
seeds including indirect relations by treating each
seed as a label. First, each translated seed is assigned
to a label, and then the labels are propagated in the
graph described in Section 3.1.
The seed distribution for each word is initialized
as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.670871625">
{ 1 if vi ∈ Vs and z = vi
0 if vi ∈ Vs and z ≠vi
u(z) otherwise
where Vs is the set of vertices corresponding to
translated seeds, u is a uniform distribution, qki (i =

agation, and qki (z) is the weight of a label (i.e., a
translated seed) z in qki .
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999919142857143">
After initialization, we iteratively propagate the
seeds through weighted edges. In each propagation,
seeds are probabilistically propagated from linked
vertices under the condition that larger edge weights
allow seeds to travel through easier. Thus, the closer
vertices are, the more likely they have similar seed
distributions. In Figure 1, the balloons attached to

tributions generated by propagations. For example,
the English word “piranha” has the seed distribution

lation task, which is called NTCIR parallel data
hereafter) in the patent data. However, a preliminary
examination showed that the NTCIR parallel data
covers less than 3% of all words because there are
a number of technical terms and neologisms. There-
fore, the patent translation task is a task that requires
bilingual lexicon extraction from non-parallel data.
We selected documents belonging to the physics
domain from each monolingual corpus based on In-
ternational Patent Classification (IPC) code6, and
then used them as a comparable corpus in our ex-
periments. As a result, we used 1,479,831 Japanese
documents and 438,227 English documents. The
reason for selecting the physics domain is that this
domain contains the most documents of all the do-
mains.
The Japanese texts were segmented and part-of-
speech tagged by ChaSen7, and the English texts
were tokenized and part-of-speech tagged by Tree-
Tagger (Schmid, 1994). Next, function words were
removed since function words with little seman-
tic information spuriously co-occurred with many
words. As a result, the number of distinct words
in Japanese corpus and English corpus amounted to
1,111,302 and 4,099,8258, respectively.
We employed seed lexicons from two sources:
(1) EDR bilingual dictionary (EDR, 1990), (2)
automatic word alignments generated by running
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) with the NTCIR par-
allel data consisting of 3,190,654 parallel sentences.
From each source, we extracted pairs of nouns ap-
pearing in our corpus. From (2), we excluded word
pairs where the average of 2-way translation proba-

8The English words contain words in tables or mathematical
formula but the Japanese words do not because the data format
differs between English and Japanese. This is why the number
of English words is larger than that of Japanese words, even
though the number of English documents is smaller than that of
Japanese documents.

bilities was lower than 0.5. The pairs from (1) and
(2) amounted to 27,353 and 2,853 respectively, and
the two sets were not exclusive. In order to mea-
sure the impact of seed lexicon size, we prepared
two seed lexicons: LexL, a large seed lexicon that is
a union of all the extracted word pairs, and LexS, a
small seed lexicon that is a union of a random sam-
pling one-tenth of the pairs from (1) and one-tenth
of the pairs from (2). Table 1 shows the size of each
seed lexicon. Note that our seed lexicons include
one-to-many or many-to-one translation pairs.
We randomly selected 1,000 Japanese words as
our test data which were identified as either a noun
or an unknown by ChaSen and were not covered ei-
ther by the EDR bilingual dictionary or by the NT-
CIR parallel data. This is because the purpose of our
method is to complement existing bilingual dictio-
naries or parallel data. Note that the Japanese words
in our test data may not have translation equivalents
in the English side.

<bodyText confidence="0.99998019047619">
We evaluated two types of our label propagation
based methods against two baselines. Cooc em-
ploys co-occurrence graphs and Sim uses similarity
graphs when constructing graphs for label propaga-
tion as described in Section 3.
Rapp is a typical context-similarity-based
method described in Section 2 (Rapp, 1999).
Context words are words in a window (window size
is 10) and are treated separately for each position.
Associations with context words are computed
using the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). The
similarity measure between context vectors is the
city-block metric.
Andrade is a sophisticated method in context-
similarity-based methods (Andrade et al., 2010).
Context is a set of words with a positive association
in a window (window size is 10). The association
is calculated using the PMI estimated by a Bayesian
method, and a similarity between contexts is esti-
mated based on the number of overlapping words
(see the original paper for details).

LexS). We measure the performance on bilingual
lexicon extraction as Top N accuracy (AccA which
is the number of test words whose top N translation
candidates contain a correct translation equivalent
over the total number of test words (=1,000). Table
2 shows Top 1 and Top 20 accuracy. We manually9
evaluated whether translation candidates contained a
correct translation equivalent. We did not use recall
because we do not know if the translation equiva-
lents of a test word appear in the corpus.
Table 2 shows that the proposed methods outper-
form the baselines both when using LexS and using
LexL. The improvements are statistically significant
in the sign-test with 1% significance-level. The re-
sults show that capturing the relations with all the
seeds including indirect relations is effective.
The accuracies of the baselines in Table 2 are
worse than the previous reports: 14% Acc1 and 46%
Acc10 (Andrade et al., 2010), and 72% Acc1 (Rapp,
1999). This is because previous works evalu-
ated only the queries whose translation equivalents
existed in the experiment data, which is not al-
ways true in our experiments. Moreover, previous
works evaluated only high-frequency words: com-
mon nouns (Rapp, 1999) and words with a docu-
ment frequency of at least 50 (Andrade et al., 2010).
Our test data, on the other hand, includes many low-
frequency words. It is generally true that translation
of high-frequency words is much easier than that of
low frequency words. We discuss the impact of test
word frequencies in detail in Section 5.3.
Table 2 also shows that Sim outperforms Cooc
both when using LexS and using LexL. The im-
provements of Acc20 are statistically significant in
the sign-test with 5% significance-level.

Table 3 shows a list of the top 5 translation can-
didates for the Japanese word “躁鬱病 (manic-
depression)” for each method, where the ranks of the
correct translations are shown in parentheses next to
method names. Table 4 shows the top 5 translated
seeds which characterize the query, where the val-
ues in parentheses indicate weight. Table 3 shows
that Cooc(L) can find the correct translation equiv-
alent but Andrade(L) cannot. Table 4 shows that
Cooc(L) can utilize more seeds closely tied to the
query (e.g. “神経症 (neurosis)”, “不眠症 (insom-
nia)”), which did not occur in the context of the
query in the experiment data. The result shows that
indirectly-related seeds are also important clues, and
our proposed method can utilize these.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994689">
5.2 Impact of Seed Lexicon Size
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999482431818182">
Table 2 shows that a reduction of seed lexicon size
degrades performance. This is natural for the base-
line methods because LexS cannot translate most of
context words, which are necessary for word charac-
terization. Consider Andrade(L) and Andrade(S)
in the example in Section 5.1. Table 4 shows that
Andrade(S) uses less relevant seeds with the query,
and has to express the query by seeds with less as-
sociation. For example, “精神病 (psychosis)” can-
not be used in Andrade(S) because LexS does not
have the seed. Therefore, it is more difficult for
Andrade(S) to find correct translation pairs.
The proposed methods also share the same ten-
dency, although each word is expressed by all the
seeds in the seed lexicon. Consider Cooc(L) and
Cooc(S) in the above example. Table 4 shows that
Cooc(S) expresses the query by a smooth seed dis-
tribution, which is difficult to discriminate from oth-
ers. This is because LexS does not have relevant
seeds for the query. This is why Cooc(S) cannot
find the correct translation equivalent. On the other
hand, Cooc(L) characterizes “躁鬱病” and “manic-
depression” by strongly relevant seeds (e.g. “精神
病 (psychosis)”,“神経症 (neurosis)”), and then finds
the correct translation equivalent.
To examine the robustness-to-seed lexicon size,
we calculated the reduction rate of Acc20 with the
following expression: (Acc20 with LexL − Acc20
with LexS) / Acc20 with LexL. The reduction rates
of Rapp, Andrade, Cooc, and Sim are 78.4%,
76.1%, 69.6%, and 62.4% respectively. Moreover,
the difference between degradation in Cooc and that
in Andrade is statistically significant in the sign-test
with 1% significance-level. These results indicate
that the proposed methods are more robust to seed
lexicon size than the baselines. This is because the
proposed methods can utilize seeds with indirect re-
lations while the baselines utilize only seeds in the
context.
To verify our claim, we examined the number
of test words which occurred with no seeds in the
context. There were 570 such words in Rapp(S),
387 in Rapp(L), 572 in Andrade(S), and 388 in
Andrade(L). The baselines cannot find their trans-

lation equivalents. Words such as this occur even if
using LexL, and that number increases when LexS
is used. On the other hand, the proposed methods
are able to utilize all the seeds in order to find equiv-
alents for words such as these. Therefore, the pro-
posed methods work well even if the coverage of a
seed lexicon is low.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99956">
5.3 Impact of Word Frequencies
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995828">
Our test data includes many low-frequency words
which are not covered by the EDR bilingual dic-
tionary or the NTCIR parallel data. 624 words ap-
pear in the corpus less than 50 times. Table 5 shows
AccN using LexL for 624 low-frequency words and
376 high-frequency words. Table 5 shows that per-
formance for low-frequency words is much worse
than that for high-frequency words. This is because
translation of high-frequency words utilizes abun-
dant and reliable context information, while the con-
text information for low-frequency words is statis-
tically unreliable. In the proposed methods, edges
linking rare words are sometimes generated based
on accidental co-occurrences, and then unrelated
seed information is transferred through the edges.
Therefore, even our label propagation based meth-
ods, especially for Cooc, could not identify the cor-
rect translation equivalents for rare words. Sim al-
leviated the problem by using a similarity graph in
which edges are generated based on global correla-
tion among words, as indicated by Table 5. Table
5 also suggests that top 20 translation candidates for
high-frequency words have potential to contribute to
bilingual tasks such as MT and CLIR although the
overall performance is still low.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996175">
5.4 Effect of Similarity Graphs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995043478261">
We examined AccN for synonyms of translated
seeds in Japanese. The Acc1 and Acc20 of Sim(L)
are 15.6% and 56.3%, respectively, and those of
Cooc(L) are 9.4% and 37.5%, respectively. The
results show that similarity graphs are effective for
clustering synonyms into the same translation equiv-
alents. For example, Sim(L) extracted the correct
translation pair of the English word “iodine” and
the Japanese word “イオディン”, a synonym of the
translated seed “ヨウ素 (iodine)” in Japanese. This
is because synonyms tend to be linked in the similar-
ity graph and have similar seed distributions. On the
other hand, in the co-occurrence graph, synonyms
tend to be indirectly linked through mutual context
words, so the seed distributions of the two could be
far away from each other.
There are in particular many loanwords in patent
documents, which are spelled in different ways from
person to person. For example, the loan word for the
English word “user” is often written as “ユーザ”,
but it is sometimes written as “ユーザー”, with an
additional prolonged sound mark. Therefore, Sim
is particularly effective for the experiment data.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.93972">
5.5 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990333333333">
We discuss errors of the proposed methods except
the errors for low-frequency words (see Section
5.3). Our test data includes words whose transla-
tion equivalents inherently cannot be found. The
first of these types are words whose equivalent does
not exist in the English corpus. This is an unavoid-
able problem for methods based on comparable cor-
pora. The second one are words whose English
equivalents are compound words. The Japanese
morphological analyzer tends to group a compound
word into a single word, while the English text an-
alyzer does not perform a collocation of words di-
vided by the delimiter space. For example, the sin-
gle Japanese word “掌紋” is equivalent to “palm
pattern” or “palm print”, which is composed of
two words. This case was counted as an error
even though the proposed methods found the word
“palm” as a equivalent of “掌紋”.
A main reason of errors other than those above
is word sense ambiguity, which is different in ev-
ery language. For example, the Japanese word “右”
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998186">

<bodyText confidence="0.9998495">
means “right” and “conservatism” in English. The
proposed methods merge different senses by prop-
agating seeds through these polysemous words in
only one language side. This is why translation pairs
could have wrong seed distributions and then the
proposed methods could not identify correct trans-
lation pairs. We will leave this word sense disam-
biguation problem for future work.

6 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820936170213">
Besides the comparable corpora approach discussed
in Section 2, many alternatives have been proposed
for bilingual lexicon extraction. The first is a method
that finds translation pairs in parallel corpora (Wu
and Xia, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Och and
Ney, 2003). However, large parallel corpora are only
available for a few language pairs and for limited
domains. Moreover, even the large parallel corpora
are relatively smaller than comparable corpora.
The second is a method that exploits the Web. Lu
et al. (2004) extracted translation pairs by mining
web anchor texts and link structures. As an alter-
native, mixed-language web pages are exploited by
first retrieving texts including both source and tar-
get languages from the web by using a search en-
gine or simple rules, and then extracting transla-
tion pairs from the mixed-language texts utilizing
various clues: Zhang and Vines (2004) used co-
occurrence statistics, Cheng et al. (2004) used co-
occurrences and context similarity information, and
Huang et al. (2005) used phonetic, semantic and
frequency-distance features. Lin et al. (2008) pro-
posed a method for extracting parenthetically trans-
lated terms, where a word alignment algorithm is
used for establishing the correspondences between
in-parenthesis and pre-parenthesis words. However,
those methods cannot find translation pairs when
they are not connected with each other through link
structures, or when they do not co-occur in the same
text.
Transliteration is a completely different way for
bilingual lexicon acquisition, in which a word in
one language is converted into another language us-
ing phonetic equivalence (Knight and Graehl, 1998;
Karimi et al., 2011). Although machine transliter-
ation works particularly well for proper names and
loan words, it cannot be employed for phonetically
dissimilar translations.
All the methods mentioned above may poten-
tially extract translation pairs more precisely than
our comparable corpora approach when their under-
lying assumptions are satisfied. We might improve
the performance of our method by augmenting a
seed lexicon with translation pairs extracted using
the above methods, as experimented with in Section
4, in which additional lexical entries are included
from parallel data.

7 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981346153846">
We proposed a novel bilingual lexicon extraction
method using label propagation for alleviating the
limited seed lexicon size problem. The proposed
method captures relations with all the seeds in-
cluding indirect relations by propagating seed in-
formation. Moreover, we proposed using similar-
ity graphs in propagation process in addition to co-
occurrence graphs. Our experiments showed that the
proposed method outperforms conventional context-
similarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et
al., 2010), and the similarity graphs improve the
performance by clustering synonyms into the same
translation.
We are planning to investigate the following open
problems in future work: word sense disambigua-
tion and translation of compound words as described
in (Daille and Morin, 2005; Morin et al., 2007).
In addition, indirect relations have also been used
in other tasks, such as paraphrase acquisition from
bilingual parallel corpora (Kok and Brockett, 2010).
We will utilize their random walk approach or other
graph-based techniques such as modified adsorp-
tion (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for generating
seed distributions. We are also planning an end-to-
end evaluation, for instance, by employing the ex-
tracted bilingual lexicon into an MT system.

<abstract confidence="0.999875222222222">This paper proposes a novel method for lexicon extraction that extracts translation pairs from comparable corpora by using graphbased label propagation. In previous work, it was established that performance drastically decreases when the coverage of a seed lexicon is small. We resolve this problem by utilizing indirect relations with the bilingual seeds together with direct relations, in which each word is represented by a distribution of translated seeds. The seed distributions are propagated over a graph representing relations among words, and translation pairs are extracted by identifying word pairs with a high similarity in the seed distributions. We propose two types of the graphs: a co-occurrence graph, representing co-occurrence relations between words, and a similarity graph, representing context similarities between words. Evaluations using English and Japanese patent comparable corpora show that our proposed graph propagation method outperforms conventional methods. Further, the similarity graph achieved improved performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation.</abstract>

Then, in edge pruning, we preserve the edges with top 100 weight for each vertex. 3.2 Seed Propagation LP is a graph-based technique which transfers the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data in order to infer labels for unlabeled data. This is primarily used when there is scarce labeled data but abundant unlabeled data. LP has been successfully applied in common natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), multi-class lexicon acquisition (Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), and part-of-speech tagging (Das and Petrov, 2011). LP iteratively propagates label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges, and then a label distribution for each vertex is generated where the weights of all labels add up to 1. We adopt LP to obtain relations with all bilingual seeds including indirect relations by treating each seed as a label. First, each translated seed is assigned to a label, and then the labels are propagated in the graph described in Section 3.1. The seed distribution for </context>

In addition to the co-occurrence-based graph construction, we propose a similarity graph, which also takes into account context similarities between words. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: • We propose a bilingual lexicon extraction method that captures co-occurrence relations with all the seeds, including indirect relations, using graph-based label propagation. In our experiments, we confirm that the proposed method outperforms conventional context-similarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010), and works well even if the coverage of a seed lexicon is low. • We propose a similarity graph which represents context similarities between words. In our experiments, we confirm that a similarity graph is more effective than a co-occurrence-based graph. 2 Context-Similarity-based Extraction Method The bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora was pioneered in (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995). The popular similarity-based methods consist of the following steps: modeling contexts, calculating context similarities, and finding translation pairs. Step 1.

Some treated context words equally regardless of their positions (Fung and Yee, 1998), while others treated the words separately for each position (Rapp, 1999). Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002), tf-idf (Fung and Yee, 1998), pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Andrade et al., 2010), context heterogeneity (Fung, 1995), etc. Shao and Ng (2004) represented contexts using language models. Andrade et al. (2010) used a set of words with a positive association as a context. Andrade et al. (2011a) used dependency relations instead of context words. Ismail and Manandhar (2010) used only in-domain words in contexts. Pekar et al. (2006) constructed smoothed context vectors for rare words. Laws et al. (2010) used graphs in which vertices correspond to words and edges indicate three types of syntactic relations such as adjectival modification. Step 2. Calculating context similaritie</context>

Cooc employs co-occurrence graphs and Sim uses similarity graphs when constructing graphs for label propagation as described in Section 3. Rapp is a typical context-similarity-based method described in Section 2 (Rapp, 1999). Context words are words in a window (window size is 10) and are treated separately for each position. Associations with context words are computed using the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). The similarity measure between context vectors is the city-block metric. Andrade is a sophisticated method in contextsimilarity-based methods (Andrade et al., 2010). Context is a set of words with a positive association in a window (window size is 10). The association is calculated using the PMI estimated by a Bayesian method, and a similarity between contexts is estimated based on the number of overlapping words (see the original paper for details). 4.3 Experiment Results Table 2 shows the performance of each method using LexS or LexL.

We did not use recall because we do not know if the translation equivalents of a test word appear in the corpus. Table 2 shows that the proposed methods outperform the baselines both when using LexS and using LexL. The improvements are statistically significant in the sign-test with 1% significance-level. The results show that capturing the relations with all the seeds including indirect relations is effective. The accuracies of the baselines in Table 2 are worse than the previous reports: 14% Acc1 and 46% Acc10 (Andrade et al., 2010), and 72% Acc1 (Rapp, 1999). This is because previous works evaluated only the queries whose translation equivalents existed in the experiment data, which is not always true in our experiments. Moreover, previous works evaluated only high-frequency words: common nouns (Rapp, 1999) and words with a document frequency of at least 50 (Andrade et al., 2010). Our test data, on the other hand, includes many lowfrequency words. It is generally true that translation of high-frequency words is much easier than that of low frequency words. We discuss the impact of test word frequencies in detail in Sect</context>

The proposed method captures relations with all the seeds including indirect relations by propagating seed information. Moreover, we proposed using similarity graphs in propagation process in addition to cooccurrence graphs. Our experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms conventional contextsimilarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010), and the similarity graphs improve the performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation. We are planning to investigate the following open problems in future work: word sense disambiguation and translation of compound words as described in (Daille and Morin, 2005; Morin et al., 2007). In addition, indirect relations have also been used in other tasks, such as paraphrase acquisition from bilingual parallel corpora (Kok and Brockett, 2010). We will utilize their random walk approach or other graph-based techniques such as modified adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for generati</context>

Moreover, we proposed using similarity graphs in propagation process in addition to cooccurrence graphs. Our experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms conventional contextsimilarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010), and the similarity graphs improve the performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation. We are planning to investigate the following open problems in future work: word sense disambiguation and translation of compound words as described in (Daille and Morin, 2005; Morin et al., 2007). In addition, indirect relations have also been used in other tasks, such as paraphrase acquisition from bilingual parallel corpora (Kok and Brockett, 2010). We will utilize their random walk approach or other graph-based techniques such as modified adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) for generating seed distributions. We are also planning an end-toend evaluation, for instance, by employing the extracted bilingual lexicon into an MT system.

Then, in edge pruning, we preserve the edges with top 100 weight for each vertex. 3.2 Seed Propagation LP is a graph-based technique which transfers the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data in order to infer labels for unlabeled data. This is primarily used when there is scarce labeled data but abundant unlabeled data. LP has been successfully applied in common natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), multi-class lexicon acquisition (Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), and part-of-speech tagging (Das and Petrov, 2011). LP iteratively propagates label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges, and then a label distribution for each vertex is generated where the weights of all labels add up to 1. We adopt LP to obtain relations with all bilingual seeds including indirect relations by treating each seed as a label. First, each translated seed is assigned to a label, and then the labels are propagated in the graph described in Section 3.1. The seed distribution for each word is initialized as follows: { 1 if vi ∈ Vs and z = vi 0 if vi ∈ Vs and z ≠vi u(z) otherwise where Vs is the s</context>

Cooc employs co-occurrence graphs and Sim uses similarity graphs when constructing graphs for label propagation as described in Section 3. Rapp is a typical context-similarity-based method described in Section 2 (Rapp, 1999). Context words are words in a window (window size is 10) and are treated separately for each position. Associations with context words are computed using the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). The similarity measure between context vectors is the city-block metric. Andrade is a sophisticated method in contextsimilarity-based methods (Andrade et al., 2010). Context is a set of words with a positive association in a window (window size is 10). The association is calculated using the PMI estimated by a Bayesian method, and a similarity between contexts is estimated based on the number of overlapping words (see the original paper for details). 4.3 Experiment Results Table 2 shows the performance of each method using LexS or LexL.

The proposed methods merge different senses by propagating seeds through these polysemous words in only one language side. This is why translation pairs could have wrong seed distributions and then the proposed methods could not identify correct translation pairs. We will leave this word sense disambiguation problem for future work. 6 Related Work Besides the comparable corpora approach discussed in Section 2, many alternatives have been proposed for bilingual lexicon extraction. The first is a method that finds translation pairs in parallel corpora (Wu and Xia, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Och and Ney, 2003). However, large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains. Moreover, even the large parallel corpora are relatively smaller than comparable corpora. The second is a method that exploits the Web. Lu et al. (2004) extracted translation pairs by mining web anchor texts and link structures. As an alternative, mixed-language web pages are exploited by first retrieving texts including both source and target languages from the web by using a search engine or simple rules, and then extracting translation pairs from the mixed-language text</context>

The popular similarity-based methods consist of the following steps: modeling contexts, calculating context similarities, and finding translation pairs. Step 1. Modeling contexts: The context of each word is generally modeled by a vector where each dimension corresponds to a context word and each dimension has a value indicating occurrence correlation. Various definitions for the context have been used: distance-based context (e.g. in a sentence (Laroche and Langlais, 2010), in a paragraph (Fung and McKeown, 1997), in a predefined window (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010)), and syntactic-based context (e.g. predecessors and successors in dependency trees (Garera et al., 2009), certain dependency position (Otero and Campos, 2008)). Some treated context words equally regardless of their positions (Fung and Yee, 1998), while others treated the words separately for each position (Rapp, 1999).

Then, edges with a negative association, PMI(vi, vj) ≤ 0, are pruned in edge pruning. 3.1.2 Similarity Graph Co-occurrence graphs are very sensitive to accidental relation caused by lower frequent cooccurrence. Thus, we propose a similarity graph where context similarities are employed as weights of edges instead of simple co-occurrence-based correlations. Since the context similarities are computed by the global correlation among words which co-occur, a similarity graph is less subject to accidental co-occurrence. The use of a similarity graph is inspired by assumption (III): a word and its</context>

Then, in edge pruning, we preserve the edges with top 100 weight for each vertex. 3.2 Seed Propagation LP is a graph-based technique which transfers the labels from labeled data to unlabeled data in order to infer labels for unlabeled data. This is primarily used when there is scarce labeled data but abundant unlabeled data. LP has been successfully applied in common natural language processing tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005; Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), multi-class lexicon acquisition (Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff, 2007), and part-of-speech tagging (Das and Petrov, 2011). LP iteratively propagates label information from any vertex to nearby vertices through weighted edges, and then a label distribution for each vertex is generated where the weights of all labels add up to 1. We adopt LP to obtain relations with all bilingual seeds including indirect relations by treating each seed as a label.

As a solution, a number of previous works proposed extracting bilingual lexicons 24 from comparable corpora, in which documents were not direct translations but shared a topic or domain1. The use of comparable corpora is motivated by the fact that large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains. Most of the previous methods are based on assumption (I), that a word and its translation tend to appear in similar contexts across languages (Rapp, 1999). Based on this assumption, many methods calculate word similarity using context and then extract word translation pairs with a high-context similarity. We call these methods context-similaritybased methods. The context similarities are usually computed using a seed bilingual lexicon (e.g. a general bilingual dictionary) by mapping contexts expressed in two different languages into the same space.

Note that the Japanese words in our test data may not have translation equivalents in the English side. 4.2 Competing Methods We evaluated two types of our label propagation based methods against two baselines. Cooc employs co-occurrence graphs and Sim uses similarity graphs when constructing graphs for label propagation as described in Section 3. Rapp is a typical context-similarity-based method described in Section 2 (Rapp, 1999). Context words are words in a window (window size is 10) and are treated separately for each position. Associations with context words are computed using the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993). The similarity measure between context vectors is the city-block metric. Andrade is a sophisticated method in contextsimilarity-based methods (Andrade et al., 2010). Context is a set of words with a positive association in a window (window size is 10). The association is calculated using the PMI estimated by a Bayesian method, and a similarity between contexts is estimated based on the number of over</context>

We did not use recall because we do not know if the translation equivalents of a test word appear in the corpus. Table 2 shows that the proposed methods outperform the baselines both when using LexS and using LexL. The improvements are statistically significant in the sign-test with 1% significance-level. The results show that capturing the relations with all the seeds including indirect relations is effective. The accuracies of the baselines in Table 2 are worse than the previous reports: 14% Acc1 and 46% Acc10 (Andrade et al., 2010), and 72% Acc1 (Rapp, 1999). This is because previous works evaluated only the queries whose translation equivalents existed in the experiment data, which is not always true in our experiments. Moreover, previous works evaluated only high-frequency words: common nouns (Rapp, 1999) and words with a document frequency of at least 50 (Andrade et al., 2010). Our test data, on the other hand, includes many lowfrequency words. It is generally true that translation of high-frequency words is much easier than that of low frequency words. We discuss the impact of test word frequencies in detail in Section 5.3. Table 2 also shows</context>

The proposed method captures relations with all the seeds including indirect relations by propagating seed information. Moreover, we proposed using similarity graphs in propagation process in addition to cooccurrence graphs. Our experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms conventional contextsimilarity-based methods (Rapp, 1999; Andrade et al., 2010), and the similarity graphs improve the performance by clustering synonyms into the same translation. We are planning to investigate the following open problems in future work: word sense disambiguation and translation of compound words as described in (Daille and Morin, 2005; Morin et al., 2007). In addition, indirect relations have also been used in other tasks, such as paraphrase acquisition from bilingual parallel corpora (Kok and Brockett, 2010). We will utilize their random walk approach or other graph-based techniques such as modified adsorption (Talukdar and Cram</context>

We selected documents belonging to the physics domain from each monolingual corpus based on International Patent Classification (IPC) code6, and then used them as a comparable corpus in our experiments. As a result, we used 1,479,831 Japanese documents and 438,227 English documents. The reason for selecting the physics domain is that this domain contains the most documents of all the domains. The Japanese texts were segmented and part-ofspeech tagged by ChaSen7, and the English texts were tokenized and part-of-speech tagged by TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). Next, function words were removed since function words with little semantic information spuriously co-occurred with many words. As a result, the number of distinct words in Japanese corpus and English corpus amounted to 1,111,302 and 4,099,8258, respectively. We employed seed lexicons from two sources: (1) EDR bilingual dictionary (EDR, 1990), (2) automatic word alignments generated by running GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) with the NTCIR parallel data consisting of 3,190,654 parallel sentences.

Some treated context words equally regardless of their positions (Fung and Yee, 1998), while others treated the words separately for each position (Rapp, 1999). Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002), tf-idf (Fung and Yee, 1998), pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Andrade et al., 2010), context heterogeneity (Fung, 1995), etc. Shao and Ng (2004) represented contexts using language models. Andrade et al. (2010) used a set of words with a positive association as a context. Andrade et al. (2011a) used dependency relations instead of context words. Ismail and Manandhar (2010) used only in-domain words in contexts. Pekar et al. (2006) constructed smoothed context vectors for rare words. Laws et al. (2010) used graphs in which vertices correspond to words and edges indicate three types of syntactic relations such as adjectival modification. Step 2.

(2004) mapped context vectors via latent classes to capture synonymy and polysemy in a seed lexicon. Fiˇser et al. (2011) and Kaji (2005) calculated 2-way similarities. Step 3. Finding translation pairs: A pair of words is treated as a translation pair when their context similarity is high. Various clues have been considered when computing the similarities: concept class information obtained from a multilingual thesaurus (D´ejean et al., 2002), co-occurrence models generated from aligned documents (Prochasson and Fung, 2011), and transliteration information (Shao and Ng, 2004). 2.1 Problems from Previous Works Most of previous methods used a seed bilingual lexicon for mapping modeled contexts in two different languages into the same space. The mapping heavily relies on the entries in a given bilingual lexicon. Therefore, if the coverage of the seed lexicon is low, the context vectors become sparser and its discriminative capability becomes lower, leading to extraction of incorrect translation equivalents. Consider the example in Figure 1, where a context-similarity-based method and our proposed method find translation equivalents of the Japanese word “1=°7=--7 (pir</context>

The proposed methods merge different senses by propagating seeds through these polysemous words in only one language side. This is why translation pairs could have wrong seed distributions and then the proposed methods could not identify correct translation pairs. We will leave this word sense disambiguation problem for future work. 6 Related Work Besides the comparable corpora approach discussed in Section 2, many alternatives have been proposed for bilingual lexicon extraction. The first is a method that finds translation pairs in parallel corpora (Wu and Xia, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Och and Ney, 2003). However, large parallel corpora are only available for a few language pairs and for limited domains. Moreover, even the large parallel corpora are relatively smaller than comparable corpora. The second is a method that exploits the Web. Lu et al. (2004) extracted translation pairs by mining web anchor texts and link structures.

The proposed method is based on assumption (II), which is derived by recursively applying assumption (I) to the “contexts”: a word and its translation tend to have similar co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with all bilingual seeds across languages.

To utilize indirect relations, we introduce assumption (II): a word and its translation tend to have similar co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with all bilingual seeds across languages3. Based on assumption (II), we propose to identify a word pair as a translation pair when its co-occurrence (direct and indirect) relations with all the seeds are similar. To obtain co-occurrence relations with all the seeds, including indirect relations, we focus on a graph-based label propagation (LP) technique (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002). LP transfers labels from labeled data points to unlabeled data points. In the process, all vertices have soft labels that can be interpreted as label distributions. We apply LP to bilingual lexicon extraction by representing each word as a vertex in a graph with each edge encoding a direct co-occurrence relation. Translated seeds are propagated as labels, and seed distributions are obtained for each word. From the seed distributions, we identify translation pairs. In summary, our proposed method consists of three steps (see Algorithm 1): (1) graph construc3Assumption (I) indicates direct co-</context>

This paper presents the Kazakh Language Corpus
(KLC), which is one of the first attempts made
within a local research community to assemble a
Kazakh corpus. KLC is designed to be a large scale
corpus containing over 135 million words and con-
veying five stylistic genres: literary, publicistic, of-
ficial, scientific and informal. Along with its pri-
mary part KLC comprises such parts as: (i) anno-
tated sub-corpus, containing segmented documents
encoded in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
that marks complete morphological, syntactic, and
structural characteristics of texts; (ii) as well as a
sub-corpus with the annotated speech data. KLC has
a web-based corpus management system that helps
to navigate the data and retrieve necessary informa-
tion. KLC is also open for contributors, who are
willing to make suggestions, donate texts and help
with annotation of existing materials.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980689655172">
This article describes theoretical and practical issues ex-
perienced during the construction of the Kazakh Lan-
guage Corpus. Kazakh is an agglutinative and highly in-
flected language which belongs to the Turkic group. It is
official state language of Kazakhstan and a mother tongue
for more than 10 million people all around the world.
However, up until the early 90’s of 20th century, due to
historical reasons of the Soviet era, Russian language was
the predominant language in spoken and written commu-
nication in Kazakhstan. This fact in turn caused the prob-
lem of underrepresentation of Kazakh language in var-
ious fields such as science, entertainment, official doc-
umentation, etc. For this reason, while assembling the
corpus, we had to group categories that are generally pre-
sented as separate in other corpora into five stylistic gen-
res. Also, in contrast to other corpora (Aksan et al., 2012;
Chen, 1996), we included texts as they were available,
i.e we did not try to fill a predefined set of categories.
Substantial part of materials was collected using source-
customized web crawlers and donated texts.
KLC also contains a manually annotated sub-corpus
with morpho-syntactic and structural markups encoded
in XML following general notions outlined in CES (Ide,
1998). Our syntactic tagset comprises a set of syntactic
categories well-defined in a classical Kazakh grammar,
and the part of speech (POS) tagset is based on a posi-
tional system in which the tags are formed by concatena-
tion of POS of a word form and a chain of encoded lin-
guistic properties, such as number, case, voice etc. The
annotations have been carried out manually by philology
students specializing in morphology and syntax. Trying
to make the annotation process as comfortable as possi-
ble, we have designed a web-based annotation tool with
a user-friendly interface. We took a great care for the an-
notation quality, and to do that we (i) arranged the valida-
tion process, and (ii) equipped the tool with a recommen-
dation system that, as we will show, improves the inter-
annotator agreement.
As a part of KLC we have also compiled the annotated
read-speech corpus (RSC), which includes audio record-
ings of words, phrases, sentences (from all genres), news
articles and excerpts from books, that were carefully cho-
sen from the primary part of the corpus. All text materials
were read by volunteers who represented different age,
gender, region and education backgrounds in a balanced
way. Each audio file is accompanied with a label file and
a corresponding text transcript. Moreover, some of the
transcripts have been grammatically annotated, i.e. in ad-
dition to a word-level segmentation of audio information
a portion of our data has lexical, and morpho-syntactic
annotations. In total RSC contains 10GB or more than 40
hours of speech.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews
the existing work. Section 3 provides detailed informa-
tion about the primary corpus. Sections 4 and 5 thor-
oughly describe annotated text and speech sub-corpora
respectively. Finally, we draw conclusions and discuss
future work in Section 6.

Since the pioneering corpus of Brown University was
completed in 1964 by Francis and Kuˇcera (1979), cor-
pus linguistics has become a thriving research field. Over
the past two decades researchers all around the world
released many corpora, including well known British
National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) developed be-
tween 1991 and 1994, and containing more than 100
million words of written and spoken language from a
wide range of sources (Ide and Macleod, 2001; Al-Sulaiti
and Atwell, 2006). All materials were selected on a ba-
sis of three independent criteria (medium, domain and
time), where each criterion had predefined target propor-
tions. The spoken part (remaining 10%) consists of or-
thographic transcriptions of unscripted informal conver-
sations and spoken language collected in different con-
texts. BNC is tagged for part of speech (POS) using
the CLAWS4 (Constituent Likelihood Automatic Word-
tagging System) (Leech et al., 1994) tagging system de-
veloped at Lancaster University. BNC is generally ac-
cepted as a balanced corpus, and many researchers, such
as the creators of Turkish National Corpus (Aksan et al.,
2012), Korean National Corpus (Kim, 2006) etc., adopted
it as a model for compiling their own corpora.
The Russian National Corpus (RNC) has been re-
leased by the group of specialists from different organi-
zations led by the Institute of Russian language, Russian
Academy of Sciences (Ruscorpora, 2003). The corpus
covers primarily a period from the middle of the XVIII
to the early XXI centuries. It includes both written texts
(fiction, memoirs, science, religious literature and others)
and recorded spoken data (public speeches and private
conversations). Currently RNC contains over 350 mil-
lion word forms that are automatically POS-tagged and
lemmatized. The corpus also includes semantic tags for
words and texts (Apresjan et al., 2006). Along with its
main part, RNC contains such subcorpora as: Deeply
Annotated Corpus, that contains sentences with a com-
plete morphological and syntax structure markup, where
the syntax structure is largely based on the Meaning-
Text Theory introduced by Aleksandr ˇZolkovskij and
Igor Mel’ˇcuk; English – Russian, German – Russian,
Ukrainian – Russian, Belorussian – Russian parallel cor-
pora; Dialect corpus; Poetry corpus and others.
Unfortunately, up until now, not too much work has
been accomplished in developing a corpus that will rep-
resent Kazakh language. To the best of our knowledge
there has been a limited number of attempts to compile
one, but resulting corpora are too small in size and scope,
or not available to the public. A Kazakh corpus has been
initiated by the Committee on Languages of the Ministry
of Culture of the Republic of Kazakhstan (CLMCRK,
2009). This corpus is small in size and not annotated, as it
remains in its very early stage of development. The new
sub-corpus for Kazakh has been recently built by Baisa et
al. as a part of larger corpus of Turkic languages (Baisa
and Suchomel, 2012). This corpus was compiled using
a web crawler that selected texts based on a language
model trained on Wikipedia texts. Although the obtained
corpus is relatively large in size, the data was not cate-
gorized by genres. Also, since a crawler was not source-
customized, the corpus may contain some noise coming
in the form of text in Russian or other languages. We also
could not find enough information about a Kazakh corpus
that has been developed at Xinjiang University and used
in their research (Altenbek and Xiao-long, 2010). The ab-
sence of an available corpus that will be large enough to
represent Kazakh language decelerates many research ac-
tivities (Mukan, 2012). We believe that building an open
Kazakh corpus will have a significant impact and it will
be very useful tool in the analysis of Kazakh.

3 KLC Primary Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984441176471">
KLC is one of the first attempts to build a large scale,
general purpose corpus that represents the present state
of Kazakh language. Currently, the size of the primary
corpus is more than 135 million words and it contains
approximately more than 400 000 documents classified
by genres into the following five sections: (1) literary
section contains Kazakh literary texts that were pub-
lished in the range from the beginning of the XX cen-
tury till present; (2) official section includes mainly of-
ficial statutes, orders, acts and other materials produced
by the governmental organizations within the period of
2009-2012; (3) scientific section includes books, research
monographs, dissertations, articles and essays from vari-
ous fields (informatics, biology, chemistry, etc.); (4) pub-
licistic section contains periodicals and articles from on-
line sources, i.e. newspapers and magazines published
over the last ten years; (5) informal language section in-
cludes documents with colloquial Kazakh texts extracted
from the popular blog platforms starting from 2009. We
have to note that while compiling this corpus we inten-
tionally relaxed the document selection criteria by not re-
stricting the collected data to particular domains, media,
and time. This was mainly dictated by the lack of ma-
terials, and partially due to the reasons mentioned in the
introduction.
Our main sources of data were Internet websites as
well as digitized forms of books, dissertations and arti-
cles from public and personal libraries. For each website
we designed a source-specific crawler, thereby increas-
ing the precision of the meta data (e.g. authors, news
categories, etc.) extraction. Additionally, we filtered out
documents with a high consistency of Russian texts by
aligning them to a language model trained on pure Rus-
sian texts. We also filtered out all documents with the size

3.1 Text Documents Description
</subsectionHeader>
<listItem confidence="0.8221357">
Each document is stored in a plain text format in the UTF-
8 encoding. Documents contain both the content and the
meta-data in a single file, and have the following simple
structure:
• TITLE – the title of a document;
• SOURCE – the source of a document
• AUTHOR – the author(s) of a document;
• DATE – the date when a document was published;
• META – additional information;
• TEXT – the content of a document.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997428">
Provided that the corresponding information is present
in a source, the &lt;META&gt; tag contains both the name of
the section of the corpus to which a document belongs
and a further categorical sub-division, such as the type of
a literary work, e.g. a poem. That is, whenever possi-
ble such categories are assigned automatically, e.g. some
websites provide this information. For sources that lack
meta data, such as the digitized books, dissertations and
scientific papers, the corresponding categories (informat-
ics, biology, chemistry, etc.) are assigned manually.

3.2 Writing System of Kazakh language
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940333333333">
Kazakh adopts different writing systems depending on
the regions where it is spoken (Cyrillic alphabet in Kaza-
khstan, Arabic and Latin graphics in other countries).
Recently the government of Kazakhstan has decided to
adopt Kazakh alphabet to a Latin graphic. In this regard
we believe that KLC could become a valuable tool. In-
deed, we have already provided a group working on this
problem with statistical information about letter distribu-
tions in Kazakh texts. This information could also aid
in designing various speech corpora as well as a proper
Kazakh keyboard layout. It can be stated that the latter
was done rather carelessly just as a simple adjustment to
a Russian keyboard (Wikipedia, 2012). Current Kazakh
Cyrillic alphabet consists of 42 letters, whereas 9 of them
are pure Kazakh letters and the others adopt the Russian
symbolic. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Kazakh let-
ters in the corpus. It can be seen that there is a small
non-zero distribution of pure Russian letters (underlined).
This can be explained by the ineluctable use of Russian
words due to the lack of a proper translation or inheri-
tance of Russian vocabulary.

4 The Annotated Sub-corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987192307692">
In order to enhance the effectiveness of the corpus as a
research tool, we have annotated a portion of the data
for syntactic and POS tags, lemmata, and for morpheme
types and boundaries. Table 2 provides net amount and
the percentages (with respect to the current size of the
corpus) of the annotated data in terms of documents,
words, unique words, and lemmata.
The annotation process has been carried out com-
pletely manually. We favored a manual annotation over
a semi-automatic one, for the following two reasons:
(i) finding language independent tools (not to mention
Kazakh-specific) which support a fine grained level of
annotation that we employ turned out to be rather chal-
lenging; (ii) though we refused and partially could not af-
ford a semi-automatic annotation we provided the anno-
tators with a semi-automatic-like annotation experience
by equipping our annotation tool with a fairly advanced
recommendation system. The annotation was performed
mainly by the undergraduate students majoring in Kazakh
philology. As a quality control measure, two validators (a
graduate student majoring in Kazakh philology and one
of the authors) were assigned to check a random sam-
ple of about 10% of the annotated data. Validators did
not just fix errors, we also held regular “work-through-
errors” sessions in an attempt to synchronize annotations.
Our analysis of validated data suggest that the annotation

tokens were fixed.
To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt
to annotate Kazakh texts with various linguistic markups.
Given this, in the following subsections we would like to
describe the tagsets (syntactic and POS), the annotation
scheme (the format in which the annotated data is stored
and distributed), and the annotation tool itself.

4.1 Designing the Tagsets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999263">
The syntactic tagset. At the initial stage of the corpus
development we did not plan to build a detailed treebank,
leaving this task for the future work. Therefore, our syn-
tactic tagset comprises a compact set of syntactic cate-
gories well-defined in a classical grammar. Table 3 con-
tains the tagset description along with the equivalent tags
defined in a widely used Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,
1993) tagset1. In addition to that, we also label prover-
bials which are rather common elements of Kazakh lan-
guage. We do not treat them as a separate syntactic cat-

egory, for they typically serve as a single syntactic unit
(e.g. predicate, adverbial, clause, etc.) Instead each syn-
tactic tag has a corresponding binary property that marks
the proverbial case.
The POS tagset. Kazakh is an agglutinative Turkic
language, in which word forms are generated by means
of the affix inflection. Different affix types mark different
linguistic properties. For instance, consider a translation
of a simple Kazakh sentence:
Mektepke bardym. - school.Dat go.Past.1sg - I went to
school.
In this example pronoun “I” and preposition “to” are
“hidden” in the affixes of case and person, i.e.:
Mektep(NN = a school) + ke (dative case = to school)
bar(VB, imperative = go) + dy (past tense = he/she
went) + m (1st person = I went)
As the example shows, inflected affix chains contain
important information that is not always present in the
context, hence a tagset should be designed in a way to
capture this information to the extent possible. For this
reason, we design a positional tagset (Oflazer et al., 2003;
Hajiˇc and Hladk´a, 1998; Hana and Feldman, 2010), in
which the final tags are constructed by the concatenation
of the basic tag (often POS of a word form) and the en-

coded chains of linguistic properties (LPs). Table 4 con-
tains main LPs defined in Kazakh grammar along with
their codes and cardinalities, i.e. a number of values they
accept. Although integrating a rich set of LPs may con-
siderably enlarge the size of a tagset, we tried to con-
sider as many LPs as possible for the following two rea-
sons: (i) previous research shows that increasing the size
of a tagset does not necessarily decrease the tagging ac-
curacy (Elworthy, 1995) and that for agglutinative lan-
guages omitting grammatical aspects may hurt the accu-
racy of n-gram tagging (Feldman, 2008); (ii) it is easier
to reduce a detailed tagset than to re-annotate data for the
missed information. Table 5 provides a detailed descrip-
tion of the designed tagset (not including punctuation)
both qualitatively and quantitatively. The table contains a
list of tags grouped by the ten major POS (in bold). For
each tag we provide a set of LPs it accepts and generative
capacities, i.e. the upper bound on a number of possible
tags that can be generated from a given basic tag and the
different combinations of the corresponding LPs2. The

2The multiplication of cardinalities of LPs does not always give the
exact number of possible tags, for there are rules that restrict certain
combinations of LPs. Moreover, some LP combinations may be techni-
cally valid but semantically incorrect as they would make no sense, e.g.
bala + m + myn - I am a son of my son. Where possible we tried to
account for such exceptions, checking the combinations and providing

list of 36 basic tags was compiled following the best prac-
tices of Penn tagset design (Marcus et al., 1993), and
bearing in mind the specifics of Kazakh grammar. Par-
ticularly, we broke down the major POS categories in
sub-categories, in order to capture semantic distinctions
and various usage patterns. For instance, negative (tag
#6) and desiderative (tag #7) auxiliary verbs in conjunc-
tion with main verbs are used to mark uninflected nega-
tion (via no and not) and desiderative mood construction
(via usage of to come in the meaning of to want) respec-
tively. Similarly, auxiliary nominals (tag #27) are used
as prepositional phrases such as, in front of, at the top of,
etc. Also, apart from the ordinal and cardinal numerals
we distinguish collectives (tag #15), that are used to em-
phasize completeness of quantities as in both, all three,
etc.; and fractions (tag #16) as in half, quarter, etc. Fi-
nally, following classical Kazakh grammar, we treat ono-
matopoeias (tag #34), i.e. sound imitations as in tic-tac
or knock-knock, as a distinct part of speech.
The maximum size of the tagset equals to the total gen-
erative capacity, or 3844 tags. However, depending on the
exact numbers.

than nominative, personal pronouns can be in any case for any person,
thus having a larger capacity.

additional flexibility. Even the minimal tagset of 36 basic

alents, and the latter four (Interjection through Foreign

4.2 The Annotation Scheme
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999476055555555">
We have developed an XML-based annotation scheme
that follows paradigms of the CES (Ide, 1998) and is
convertible into the XCES standard (Ide et al., 2000).
The main difference with the latter is that in our scheme
the raw text and all markup types (i.e. lexical, syntac-
tic and structural annotation; cf. Section 4) are stored in
a single document. For the morpho-lexical and syntac-
tic markups we have corresponding tags, i.e. &lt;TOK&gt; -
token and &lt;SU&gt; - syntactic unit, respectively. Main lin-
guistic characteristics, such as POS, lemmata, morpheme
segmentation and syntactic labels are marked through the
corresponding sub-tags and properties. All the afore-
mentioned tags have their place in the global hierarchy
of the structural markup. In turn, this hierarchy is in-
tegrated into the structure of an XML document itself.
Figure 2 shows the schematic representation of the devel-
oped structural markup. A statement A → B represents
“A is contained by B” relation.

4.3 The Annotation Tool
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999604">
To ease the process of annotation we have developed a
special tool that was designed as a web application with
a logging and a document management system. The tool
allows for (auto)saving current work and reviewing and
revising the already annotated documents.
Functionality-wise the tool consists of the following
three modules: (1) the syntactic module is designed
to parse sentences using the syntactic tagset described
in subsection 4.1, and to simultaneously mark sentence
boundaries; (2) the morpho-lexical module is designed to
perform a morphological analysis, and to comprise such
functionalities as morpheme segmentation, POS tagging
and lemma identification; (3) finally, the structural mod-
ule is designed to mark up the logical structure of a docu-
ment, i.e. paragraphs, dialogues, direct speech, lists, etc.
Annotation of a given document is performed in the order
in which we described the modules. The decision on such
an order, as many other major design decisions, was made
accounting for the annotators’ feedback, suggestions and
requests, thus making the annotation experience as con-
venient as possible. The validators have almost identical
interface with additional functionality, such as a quick
look up and correction of word-level (morphology) and
sentence-level (syntax) markups. Also, both the valida-
tors and the annotators have means to correct orthography
and punctuation. However, the originals of each and ev-
ery annotated document are kept. In fact we have already
collected data on misspellings to use in our ongoing re-
search in spelling correction.
We have also developed a recommendation system for
morphological analysis based on the already annotated
data. For a given word or a given morpheme, the system
generates a list of recommended markups ordered by the
decreasing frequency of the previous usage. While this
approach arguably has a potential to propagate errors, our
experiments suggest the opposite. We have measured the
inter-annotator agreement, average mean absolute error
(MAE), and the annotation speed with and without the
recommendation system. All measurements were taken
for five annotators, who had been working with the tool
for two weeks. For the experiments the annotators were
given a randomly chosen news article containing about
300 words. The agreement was calculated using Fleiss’
kappa (Fleiss and others, 1971). The average MAE was
calculated as

<bodyText confidence="0.9985622">
where A is a set of annotators, W is a number of words in
a test document, and Ca is a number of words correctly
annotated by the annotator a. The golden truth annota-
tion was provided by the validators. The comparison of
the measurements is given in Table 6. As we can see

the inter-annotator agreement improves with the incorpo-
ration of the recommendations, while, in contrast to the
error propagation assumption, the error rate slightly de-
creases. Moreover, we get more than 100 words/hour in-
crease in the labeling speed. Thus, we conclude that as
long as the quality of the already annotated data is high,
the recommendation system will help to produce quality
annotations at a higher speed. One can argue that we used
a rather small sample of data to evaluate our recommen-
dation system. However, we drew conclusions not only
from the experimental results but also from opinions of
validators, who confirmed that they noticed that after in-
tegrating the recommendation system annotations grew
more coherent and synchronized.
Finally, let us provide a brief technical descrip-
tion of the tool. The design and structure of
the front end is based on HTML5 and CSS3.
We also use JQuery for HTML elements manipu-
lation and various event handling. The tool can
be tried out at http://kazcorpus.kz/klcweb/

mation about it can be found at http://kazcorpus.

5 Read Speech Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947153846154">
Most of the modern speech processing systems require a
large amount of audio and text data for training acoustic
and language models. Depending on the type of an appli-
cation required data varies from high quality microphone
read speech (Garofalo et al., 2007) to conversational tele-
phone speech (Godfrey and Holliman, 1997; Canavan
and Zipperlen, 1996), from continuous speech (Garo-
folo et al., 1993) to connected (Leonard and Doddington,
1993) and isolated words (Pitrelli et al., 1995). In our cur-
rent work, we collected a corpus of more than 40 hours of
high quality microphone read Kazakh speech of 169 na-
tive speakers for the large vocabulary continuous speech
recognition tasks.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99505">
5.1 Text Materials
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999923">
The text materials to be uttered were carefully selected
from the primary section of the corpus and divided into
two parts: sentences and stories. The “sentences” part
has more than 12 000 different sentences randomly and
equally extracted from all of the five genre specific sec-
tions of the corpus. The sentences are chosen so that in
total they contain more than 120 000 words which be-
long to the set of the most frequent words that cover the
95% of all the texts in the corpus. Additionally, the sen-
tences were grouped according to their length in words.
Thus, we have ten groups of sentences, so that the first
group contains the sentences of length six, the second –
of length seven, and so on up until the length of 15.
The “stories” part contains short online news extracted
from publicistic genre section of the corpus. Each story
consists of up to 300 words. All the materials were
subdivided into non-intersecting sets of texts and dis-
tributed among the speakers in the following manner.
Each speaker was assigned exactly 75 sentences and one
story. Of the 75 sentences 50 belonged to the first five

“short-sentenced” groups (10 sentences per each group),
and the remaining 25 belonged to the last five “long-
sentenced” groups (5 sentences per each group).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998861">
5.2 Speakers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999976538461538">
The main criteria of a speaker selection were the follow-
ing: a region where (s)he learned Kazakh or spent most of
his/her life; age; gender; and the ability to read Kazakh.
The first criterion helped us to capture various accents
attributed to speakers’ settlement both local and exter-
nal. From the regional perspective we divide the speakers
into 15 groups: 14 domestic (one per each administra-
tive region, i.e. “oblast”, of Kazakhstan) and one abroad
(all foreign countries). Furthermore, the speakers are di-
vided into the following four age groups (not including
children and school students): (i) 18-27 years, (ii) 28-37
years, (iii) 38-47 years, (iv) 48 years and above. We did
not strictly balance the speakers by their gender due to
the difficulties in finding the volunteers, but still tried to
choose no more than three speakers of the same gender
per one age-regional group. A female-to-male distribu-
tion of speakers is 57% to 43%, respectively.
The other important criterion is the ability to read
Kazakh, since not all of the interviewees could read in
Kazakh sufficiently fluent, which is a common issue in a
bilingual country such as Kazakhstan. Additionally, we
kept a record of the speakers’ education, i.e. whether they
attended and graduated from a university, or graduated
from a school or a college without attending any univer-
sities.
The speakers were encoded using the fol-
lowing scheme: &lt;Region&gt;&lt;Gender&gt;&lt;Year of
birth&gt;&lt;Initials&gt;&lt;Education&gt;, where “Region” holds
the values in the range of [1-15], “Gender” – F or M,
“Year of birth” – the last two digits of a year of birth,
”Initials” – initials of a name followed by a surname,
“Education” – 1 for school, 2 for college, and 3 for
university, e.g. 06F70ZK3.
In total, we have recorded 169 speakers. Table 7
presents a distribution of the speakers across the age,
gender and regional groups. The blank spots show the
speaker profiles that we could not recruit. Mostly, these
cases correspond to the distant regions and elder male
groups.

5.3 Recording Setup

<bodyText confidence="0.9998695">
The actual recording sessions took place in a sound-proof
studio of the university with the assistance of a sound
operator. Before the recordings, the speakers were in-
structed, documented and given some time to prepare, as
well as asked to fill in the copyright transfer form for the
audio data with their voice. They were not constrained
on the manner, speed or time except for the correctness
of reading. The average time for a recording session

per speaker was about 40-45 minutes, though there were
cases that lasted for two hours. Audio data was captured
using a professional vocal microphone Neumann TLM
49 and digitized by LEXICON I-ONIX U82S sound card.
The format of the recorded audio files is 44.1 kHz 16-bit
PCM-encoded mono WAVE file format. All the recorded
audio files were manually post-processed to have each ut-
terance (sentences and stories) in a separate file and in the
corresponding directories. The size of the speech corpus
is about 8.5 GB on disk. A collective duration of the au-
dio files is more than 40 hours long.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.985135">
5.4 Transcription and Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889692307692">
Each audio file is provided with its corresponding or-
thographic transcription and TIMIT-style word-level seg-
mentation, as well as morpho-syntactic annotation files.
Both the transcript generation and the annotation were
performed manually by trained linguists. The transcrip-
tion files contain the exact orthographic transcriptions
of the utterances, which may differ from the original
text. For example, the numbers, abbreviation, foreign
words and dates are expanded depending on how they
were uttered by the speakers. In addition, the transcrip-
tion of the stories have the sentence boundaries labeled
with &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; tags. For the segmentation we
used WaveSurfer (2013), an open-source tool for sound

visualization and manipulation, which supports TIMIT
word-level transcription format. Although, it supports
Unicode, it does provide a proper support for Kazakh
symbols. Therefore, we used an ASCII version of the
Kazakh letters depicted on Figure 3. Also, we used the #
symbol for the pauses and silence, and ˆ symbol for other
non-speech events.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999539777777778">
In this work we have described the design and compila-
tion process of the Kazakh Language Corpus. KLC is
oriented for a wide range of users and we believe that it
will be a valuable tool for research communities, espe-
cially given that a portion of the data has been labeled
with multiple levels of annotation, including word-level
segmentation of audio information. We are already using
the annotated data in our initial experiments in morpheme
segmentation and error correction.
One can explore the corpus through the website
(http://kazcorpus.kz) that was designed to pro-
vide the best experience in the analysis of data.
For the future work we plan to use the corpus as a re-
search tool to tackle the following problems: (i) auto-
matic part of speech tagging, (ii) morphological disam-
biguation, (iii) statistical machine translation. For the
latter we have already started collecting parallel text in
Russian and English.

Over the past two decades researchers all around the world released many corpora, including well known British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) developed between 1991 and 1994, and containing more than 100 million words of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources (Ide and Macleod, 2001; Al-Sulaiti and Atwell, 2006).

The absence of an available corpus that will be large enough to represent Kazakh language decelerates many research activities (Mukan, 2012). We believe that building an open Kazakh corpus will have a significant impact and it will be very useful tool in the analysis of Kazakh. 3 KLC Primary Corpus KLC is one of the first attempts to build a large scale, general purpose corpus that represents the present state of Kazakh language. Currently, the size of the primary corpus is more than 135 million words and it contains approximately more than 400 000 documents classified by genres into the fol</context>

The corpus covers primarily a period from the middle of the XVIII to the early XXI centuries. It includes both written texts (fiction, memoirs, science, religious literature and others) and recorded spoken data (public speeches and private conversations). Currently RNC contains over 350 million word forms that are automatically POS-tagged and lemmatized. The corpus also includes semantic tags for words and texts (Apresjan et al., 2006). Along with its main part, RNC contains such subcorpora as: Deeply Annotated Corpus, that contains sentences with a complete morphological and syntax structure markup, where the syntax structure is largely based on the MeaningText Theory introduced by Aleksandr ˇZolkovskij and Igor Mel’ˇcuk; English – Russian, German – Russian, Ukrainian – Russian, Belorussian – Russian parallel corpora; Dialect corpus; Poetry corpus and others.

However, up until the early 90’s of 20th century, due to historical reasons of the Soviet era, Russian language was the predominant language in spoken and written communication in Kazakhstan. This fact in turn caused the problem of underrepresentation of Kazakh language in various fields such as science, entertainment, official documentation, etc. For this reason, while assembling the corpus, we had to group categories that are generally presented as separate in other corpora into five stylistic genres. Also, in contrast to other corpora (Aksan et al., 2012; Chen, 1996), we included texts as they were available, i.e we did not try to fill a predefined set of categories. Substantial part of materials was collected using sourcecustomized web crawlers and donated texts. KLC also contains a manually annotated sub-corpus with morpho-syntactic and structural markups encoded in XML following general notions outlined in CES (Ide, 1998). Our syntactic tagset comprises a set of syntactic categories well-defined in a classical Kazakh grammar, and the part of speech (POS) tagset is based on a positional system in which the tags are formed by concatenation of POS of a wo</context>

Over the past two decades researchers all around the world released many corpora, including well known British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2007) developed between 1991 and 1994, and containing more than 100 million words of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources (Ide and Macleod, 2001; Al-Sulaiti and Atwell, 2006). All materials were selected on a basis of three independent criteria (medium, domain and time), where each criterion had predefined target proportions. The spoken part (remaining 10%) consists of orthographic transcriptions of unscripted informal conversations and spoken language collected in different contexts. BNC is tagged for part of speech (POS) using the CLAWS4 (Constituent Likelihood Automatic Wordtagging System) (Leech et al., 1994) tagging system developed at Lancaster University.

The main difference with the latter is that in our scheme the raw text and all markup types (i.e. lexical, syntactic and structural annotation; cf. Section 4) are stored in a single document. For the morpho-lexical and syntactic markups we have corresponding tags, i.e. &lt;TOK&gt; - token and &lt;SU&gt; - syntactic unit, respectively. Main linguistic characteristics, such as POS, lemmata, morpheme segmentation and syntactic labels are marked through the corresponding sub-tags and properties. All the aforementioned tags have their place in the global hierarchy of the structural markup. In turn, this hier</context>

Also, in contrast to other corpora (Aksan et al., 2012; Chen, 1996), we included texts as they were available, i.e we did not try to fill a predefined set of categories. Substantial part of materials was collected using sourcecustomized web crawlers and donated texts. KLC also contains a manually annotated sub-corpus with morpho-syntactic and structural markups encoded in XML following general notions outlined in CES (Ide, 1998). Our syntactic tagset comprises a set of syntactic categories well-defined in a classical Kazakh grammar, and the part of speech (POS) tagset is based on a positional system in which the tags are formed by concatenation of POS of a word form and a chain of encoded linguistic properties, such as number, case, voice etc. The annotations have been carried out manually by philology students specializing in morphology and syntax. Trying to make the annotation process as comfortable as possible, we have designed a web-based annotation tool with a user-friendly interface. We took a great care for th</context>

Lastly, given the designed tagset the aforementioned Kazakh sentence can be tagged as follows: Mektepke/ZEP A0N0S0P3C3 (ZEP - non-personal noun; A0 - inanimate; N0 - singular; S0 - no possessor; P3 - 3rd person; C3 - dative case) bardym/ET G0T3M1V0P1 (ET - regular verb; G0 - not negated; T3 - past tense; M1 - indicative mood; V0 - active voice; P1 - 1st person) ./. 4.2 The Annotation Scheme We have developed an XML-based annotation scheme that follows paradigms of the CES (Ide, 1998) and is convertible into the XCES standard (Ide et al., 2000). The main difference with the latter is that in our scheme the raw text and all markup types (i.e. lexical, syntactic and structural annotation; cf. Section 4) are stored in a single document. For the morpho-lexical and syntactic markups we have corresponding tags, i.e. &lt;TOK&gt; - token and &lt;SU&gt; - syntactic unit, respectively. Main linguistic characteristics, such as POS, lemmata, morpheme segmentation and syntactic labels are marked through the corresponding sub-tags and properties. All the aforementioned tags have their place in the </context>

At the initial stage of the corpus development we did not plan to build a detailed treebank, leaving this task for the future work. Therefore, our syntactic tagset comprises a compact set of syntactic categories well-defined in a classical grammar. Table 3 contains the tagset description along with the equivalent tags defined in a widely used Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) tagset1. In addition to that, we also label proverbials which are rather common elements of Kazakh language. We do not treat them as a separate syntactic cat1For ease of presentation we used bracketing instead of listing, i.e. SBAR(Q) should be read as SBARQ, SBAR; (WH)NP as WHNP, NP; etc. Table 4: Linguistic properties considered in the POS tagset design egory, for they typically serve as a single syntactic unit (e.g. predicate, adverbial, clause, etc.) Instead each syntactic tag has a corresponding binary property that marks the proverbial case.

The 2The multiplication of cardinalities of LPs does not always give the exact number of possible tags, for there are rules that restrict certain combinations of LPs. Moreover, some LP combinations may be technically valid but semantically incorrect as they would make no sense, e.g. bala + m + myn - I am a son of my son. Where possible we tried to account for such exceptions, checking the combinations and providing list of 36 basic tags was compiled following the best practices of Penn tagset design (Marcus et al., 1993), and bearing in mind the specifics of Kazakh grammar. Particularly, we broke down the major POS categories in sub-categories, in order to capture semantic distinctions and various usage patterns. For instance, negative (tag #6) and desiderative (tag #7) auxiliary verbs in conjunction with main verbs are used to mark uninflected negation (via no and not) and desiderative mood construction (via usage of to come in the meaning of to want) respectively. Similarly, auxiliary nominals (tag #27) are used as prepositional phrases such as, in front of, at the top of, etc. Also, apart from the ordinal </context>

Although the obtained corpus is relatively large in size, the data was not categorized by genres. Also, since a crawler was not sourcecustomized, the corpus may contain some noise coming in the form of text in Russian or other languages. We also could not find enough information about a Kazakh corpus that has been developed at Xinjiang University and used in their research (Altenbek and Xiao-long, 2010). The absence of an available corpus that will be large enough to represent Kazakh language decelerates many research activities (Mukan, 2012). We believe that building an open Kazakh corpus will have a significant impact and it will be very useful tool in the analysis of Kazakh. 3 KLC Primary Corpus KLC is one of the first attempts to build a large scale, general purpose corpus that represents the present state of Kazakh language. Currently, the size of the primary corpus is more than 135 million words and it contains approximately more than 400 000 documents classified by genres into the following five sections: (1) literary section contains Kazakh literary texts that were published in the range from the beginning of the XX centur</context>

Both the transcript generation and the annotation were performed manually by trained linguists. The transcription files contain the exact orthographic transcriptions of the utterances, which may differ from the original text. For example, the numbers, abbreviation, foreign words and dates are expanded depending on how they were uttered by the speakers. In addition, the transcription of the stories have the sentence boundaries labeled with &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; tags. For the segmentation we used WaveSurfer (2013), an open-source tool for sound 1029 visualization and manipulation, which supports TIMIT word-level transcription format. Although, it supports Unicode, it does provide a proper support for Kazakh symbols. Therefore, we used an ASCII version of the Kazakh letters depicted on Figure 3.

Recently the government of Kazakhstan has decided to adopt Kazakh alphabet to a Latin graphic. In this regard we believe that KLC could become a valuable tool. Indeed, we have already provided a group working on this problem with statistical information about letter distributions in Kazakh texts. This information could also aid in designing various speech corpora as well as a proper Kazakh keyboard layout. It can be stated that the latter was done rather carelessly just as a simple adjustment to a Russian keyboard (Wikipedia, 2012). Current Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet consists of 42 letters, whereas 9 of them are pure Kazakh letters and the others adopt the Russian symbolic. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Kazakh letters in the corpus. It can be seen that there is a small non-zero distribution of pure Russian letters (underlined). This can be explained by the ineluctable use of Russian words due to the lack of a proper translation or inheritance of Russian vocabulary. 4 The Annotated Sub-corpus In order to enhance the effectiveness of the corpus as a research tool, we have annotated a portion of the data for syntactic a</context>

<bodyText confidence="0.999871363636364">
With the rapid growth of social media, Twitter
has become one of the most widely adopted
platforms for people to post short and instant
message. On the one hand, people tweets
about their daily lives, and on the other hand,
when major events happen, people also fol-
low and tweet about them. Moreover, people’s
posting behaviors on events are often closely
tied to their personal interests. In this paper,
we try to model topics, events and users on
Twitter in a unified way. We propose a model
which combines an LDA-like topic model and
the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process to
capture topics and events. We further propose
a duration-based regularization component to
find bursty events. We also propose to use
event-topic affinity vectors to model the asso-
ciation between events and topics. Our exper-
iments shows that our model can accurately
identify meaningful events and the event-topic
affinity vectors are effective for event recom-
mendation and grouping events by topics.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999734818181818">
Twitter is arguably the most popular microblog site
where people can post short, instant messages to
share with families, friends and the rest of the
world. For content analysis on Twitter, two impor-
tant concepts have been repeatedly visited: (1) Top-
ics. These are longstanding themes that many per-
sonal tweets revolve around. Example topics range
from music and sports to more serious ones like pol-
itics and religion. Much work has been done to an-
alyze topics on Twitter (Ramage et al., 2010; Hong
and Davison, 2010; Zhao et al., 2011; Lau et al.,
2012). (2) Events. These are things that take place
at a certain time and attract many people’s short-
term attention in social media. Example events in-
clude concerts, sports games, scandals and elections.
Event detection on Twitter has been a hot research
topic in recent years (Petrovi´c et al., 2010; Weng and
Lee, 2011; Becker et al., 2011; Diao et al., 2012; Li
et al., 2012).
The concepts of topics and events are orthogonal
in that many events fall under certain topics. For
example, concerts fall under the topic about mu-
sic. Furthermore, being social media, Twitter users
play important roles in forming topics and events on
Twitter. Each user has her own topic interests, which
influence the content of her tweets. Whether a user
publishes a tweet related to an event also largely de-
pends on whether her topic interests match the na-
ture of the event. Modeling the interplay between
topics, events and users can deepen our understand-
ing of Twitter content and potentially aid many pred-
ication and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we
aim to construct a unified model of topics, events
and users on Twitter. Although there has been a
number of recent studies on event detection on Twit-
ter, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first that
links the topic interests of users to their tweeting be-
haviors on events.
Specifically, we propose a probabilistic latent
variable model that identifies both topics and events
on Twitter. To do so, we first separate tweets into
topic tweets and event tweets. The former are related
to a user’s personal life, such as a tweet complain-
ing about the traffic condition or wishing a friend

happy birthday. The latter are about some major
global event interesting to a large group of people,
such as a tweet advertising a concert or comment-
ing on an election result. Although considering only
topic tweets and event tweets is a much simplified
view of the diverse range of tweets, we find it ef-
fective in finding meaningful topics and events. We
further use an LDA-like model (Blei et al., 2003) to
discover topics and the Recurrent Chinese Restau-
rant Process (Ahmed and Xing, ) to discover events.
Details are given in Section 3.1.
Our major contributions lie in two novel modi-
fications to the base model described above. The
first is a duration-based regularization component
that punishes long-term events (Section 3.2). Be-
cause events on Twitter tend to be bursty, this mod-
ification presumably can produce more meaningful
events. More specifically, we borrow the idea of us-
ing pseudo-observed variables to regularize graph-
ical models (Balasubramanyan and Cohen, 2013),
and carefully design the pseudo-observed variable
in our task to capture the burstiness of events. The
second modification is adding event-topic affinity
vectors inspired by PMF-based collaborative filter-
ing (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008) (Section 3.3).
It uses the latent topics to explain users’ preferences
of events and subsequently infers the association be-
tween topics and events.
We use a real Twitter data set consisting of 500
users to evaluate our model (Section 4). We find
that the model can discover meaningful topics and
events. Comparison with our base model and with
an existing model for event discovery on Twitter
shows that the two modifications are both effective.
The duration-based regularization helps find more
meaningful events; the event-topic affinity vectors
improve an event recommendation task and helps
produce a meaningful organization of events by top-
ics.

Study of topics, events and users on Twitter is re-
lated to several branches of work. We review the
most interesting and relevant work below.
Event detection on Twitter: There have been quite
a few studies in this direction in recent years, in-
cluding both online detection (Sakaki et al., 2010;
Petrovi´c et al., 2010; Weng and Lee, 2011; Becker et
al., 2011; Li et al., 2012) and offline detection (Diao
et al., 2012). Online detection is mostly concerned
with early detection of major events, so efficiency of
the algorithms is the main focus. These algorithms
do not aim to identify all relevant tweets, nor do
they analyze the association of events with topics. In
comparison, our work focuses on modeling topics,
events and users as well as their relation. Recently,
Petrovi´c et al. (2013) pointed out that Twitter stream
does not lead news stream for major news events, but
Twitter stream covers a much wider range of events
than news stream. Our work helps better understand
these additional events on Twitter and their relations
with users’ topic interests. Our model bears similar-
ity to our earlier work (Diao et al., 2012), but we use
a non-parametric model (RCRP) to discover events
directly inside the probabilistic model.
Temporal topic modeling: A number of models
have been proposed for the temporal aspect of top-
ics (Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Wang and McCallum,
2006; Wang et al., 2007; Hong et al., 2011), but most
of them fix the number of topics. The Recurrent Chi-
nese Restaurant Process (Ahmed and Xing, ) was
proposed to model the life cycles of topics and al-
lows an infinite number of topics. It has later been
combined with LDA to model both topics and events
in news streams and social media streams (Ahmed
et al., 2011; Tang and Yang, 2012). Our work also
jointly models topics and events, but different from
previous work, we do not assume that every docu-
ment (tweet in our case) belongs to an event, which
is important because Twitter contains many personal
posts unrelated to major events.
Collaborative filtering with LDA: Part of our
model is inspired by work on collaborative fil-
tering based on probabilistic matrix factorization
(PMF) (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008). Recently
there has been some work combining LDA with
PMF to recommend items with textual content such
as news articles and advertisements (Wang and Blei,
2011; Agarwal and Chen, 2010). They use topics to
interpret the latent structure of users and items. We
borrow their idea but our items are events, which are
not known and have to be discovered by our model.

3 Our Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999889210526315">
In this section, we present our model for topics,
events and users on Twitter. We assume that we have
a stream of tweets which are divided into T epoches.
Let t E 11, 2, ... , T} be the index of an epoch.
Each epoch contains a set of tweets and each tweet
is a bag of words. We use wt,i,j E 11, 2, ... , V }
to denote the j-th word of the i-th tweet in the t-
th epoch, where V is the vocabulary size. The au-
thor of the i-th tweet in the t-th epoch (i.e. the
Twitter user who publishes the tweet) is denoted as
ut,i E 11, 2, ... , U}, where U is the total number of
Twitter users we consider.
We first present our base model in Section 3.1.
We then introduce a duration-based regularization
mechanism to ensure the burstiness of events in Sec-
tion 3.2. In Section 3.3 we discuss how we model the
relation between topics and events using event-topic
affinity vectors. Finally we discuss model inference
in Section 3.4.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.993726">
3.1 The Base Model
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999721441176471">
Recall that our objective is to model topics, events,
users and their relations. As in many topic models,
our topic is a multinomial distribution over words,
denoted as ϕa where a is a topic index. Each event is
also a multinomial distribution over words, denoted
as Ok where k is an event index. Because topics are
long-standing and stable, we fix the number of top-
ics to be A, where A can be tuned based on histor-
ical data. In contrast, events emerge and die along
the timeline. We therefore use a non-parametric
model called the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Pro-
cess (RCRP) (Ahmed and Xing, ) to model the birth
and death of events. To model the relation between
users and topics, we assume each user u has a multi-
nomial distribution over topics, denoted as θu.
As we have discussed, we separate tweets into two
categories, topic tweets and event tweets. Separa-
tion of these two categories is done through a latent
variable y sampled from a user-specific Bernoulli
distribution Tru. For topic tweets, the topic is sam-
pled from the corresponding user’s topic distribution
θu. For event tweets, the event is sampled accord-
ing to RCRP. We now briefly review RCRP. Gener-
ally speaking, RCRP assumes a Chinese Restaurant
Process (CRP) (Blackwell and MacQueen, 1973) for
items within an epoch and chains up the CRPs in ad-
jacent epochs along the timeline. Specifically, in our
case, the generative process can be described as fol-
lows. Tweets come in according to their timestamps.
In the t-th epoch, for the i-th tweet, we first flip a bi-
ased coin based on probability Tru to decide whether
this tweet is event-related. If it is, then we need to
decide which event it belongs to. It could be an ex-
isting event that has at least one related tweet in the

new event. Let nk,t−1 denote the number of tweets
related to event k at the end of epoch (t − 1). Let

in epoch t before the i-th tweet comes. Let Nt−1
denote the total number of event-related tweets in
epoch (t − 1) and N(i)
t denote the number of event-
related tweets in epoch t before the i-th tweet. Then
RCRP assumes that the probability for the i-th tweet

the “rich-get-richer” phenomenon in social media.
Finally we place Dirichlet and Beta priors on
the various parameters in our model. Formally,
the generative process of our base model is out-
lined in Figure 2, excluding the lines in bold and
blue. We also show the plate notation in Figure 1,
in which the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Pro-
cess is represented as an infinite dynamic mixture

Dt is the total number of tweets (both event-related
and topic tweets), while Nt represents the number
event-related tweets in epoch t.

3.2 Regularization on Event Durations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948427315789474">
As we have pointed out, events on Twitter tend to
be bursty, i.e. the duration of an event tends to
be short, but this characteristic is not captured by
RCRP. While there can be different ways to incor-
porate this intuition, here we adopt the idea of regu-
larization using pseudo-observed variables proposed
recently by Balasubramanyan and Cohen (2013).
We introduce a pseudo-observed binary variable rt,i
for each tweet, where the value of rt,i is set to 1
for all tweets. We assume that this variable is de-
pendent on the hidden variables y and s. Specif-
ically, if yt,i is 0, i.e. the tweet is topic-related,
then rt,i gets a value of 1 with probability 1. If
yt,i is 1, then we look at all the tweets that belong
to event st,i. Our goal is to make sure that this
tweet is temporally close to these other tweets. So
we assume that rt,i gets a value of 1 with proba-
bility exp(− ∑Tt′=1,|t′−t|&gt;1 A|t − t′|nst,i,t′), where
nst,i,t′ is the number of tweets in epoch t′ that be-

3.3 Event-Topic Affinity Vectors
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999992882352941">
So far in our model topics and events are not re-
lated. However, many events are highly related to
certain topics. For example, a concert is related to
music while a football match is related to sports. We
would like to capture these relations between top-
ics and events. One way to do it is to assume that
event tweets also have topical words sampled from
the event’s topic distribution, something similar to
the models by Ahmed et al. (2011) and by Tang
and Yang (2012). However, our prelimiary exper-
iments show that this idea does not work well on
Twitter, mainly because tweets are too short. Here
we explore another approach inspired by recommen-
dation methods based on probabilistic matrix factor-
ization (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008). The idea
is that when a user posts a tweet about an event, we
can treat the event as an item and this posting be-
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.96864">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999345">
havior as adoption of the item. If we assume that the
adoption behavior is influenced by some latent fac-
tors, i.e. the latent topics, then basically we would
like the topic distribution of this user to be close to
that of the event.
Specifically, we assume that each event k has as-
sociated with it an A-dimensional vector ηk and a
parameter 0k. The vector ηk represents the event’s
affinity to topics. 0k is a bias term that represents
the inner popularity of an event regardless of its
affinity to any topic. We further assume that each
tweet has another pseudo-observed variable ct,i that
is set to 1. For topic tweets, ct,i gets a value of 1
with probability 1. For event tweets, ct,i is gener-
ated by a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to
0st,i + ηst,i &apos; zut,i, where zu is an A-dimensional
vector denoting the empirical topic distribution of
user u’s tweets. This treatment follows the practice
of fLDA by Agarwal and Chen (2010). Let �Cu,a be
the number of tweets by user u assigned to topic a,
based on the values of the latent variables y and z.
Then

Gaussian priors once event k emerges. The genera-
tion of the variables c is shown in bold and blue in

We train the model using a stochastic EM sampling
scheme. In this scheme, we alternate between Gibbs
sampling and gradient descent. In the Gibbs sam-
pling part, we fix the values of 0k and ηk for each
event k, and then we sample the latent variables yt,i
,zt,i and st,i for each tweet. In the gradient descent
part, we update the event-topic affinity vectors ηk
and the bias term 0k of each event k by keeping the
assignment of the variables yt,i ,zt,i and st,i fixed.
For the Gibbs sampling part, we jointly sample
yt,i = 0, zt,i = a (topic tweet) and yt,i = 1, st,i = k

We evaluate our model on a Twitter dataset that con-
tains 500 users. These users are randomly selected
from a much larger pool of around 150K users based
in Singapore. Selecting users from the same coun-
try/city ensures that we find coherent and meaning-
ful topics and events. We use tweets published be-
tween April 1 and June 30, 2012 for our experi-
ments. For preprocessing, we use the CMU Twitter
POS Taggerl to tag these tweets and remove those
non-standard words (i.e. words tagged as punc-
tuation marks, emoticons, urls, at-mentions, pro-
nouns, etc.) and stop words. We also remove tweets
lhttp://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/
with less than three words. After preprocessing, the
dataset contains 655,881 tweets in total.
Recall that our model is designed to identify top-
ics, events and their relations with users. We there-
fore would like to evaluate the quality of the iden-
tified topics and events as well as the usefulness of
the discovered topic distributions of users and event-

ingful and comparable to those discovered by stan-
dard LDA, here we do not focus on evaluation of
topics. In Section 4.2 we evaluate the quality of the
discovered events. In Section 4.3 we show how the
discovered event-topic affinity vectors can be useful.
For comparison, we consider an existing method
called TimeUserLDA introduced in our previous
work (Diao et al., 2012). TimeUserLDA also mod-
els topics and events by separating topic tweets from
event tweets. However, it groups event tweets into a
fixed number of bursty topics and then uses a two-
state machine in a postprocessing step to identify
events from these bursty topics. Thus, events are
not directly modeled within the generative process
itself. In contrast, events are inherent in our gener-
ative model. We do not compare with other event
detection methods because our objective is not on-
line event detection.
We also compare our final model with two de-
generate versions of it. We refer to the base model
described in Section 3.1 as Base and the model
with the duration-based regularization as Base+Reg.
Comparison with these two degenerate models al-
lows us to assess the effect of the two modifications
we propose. We refer to the final model with both
the duration-based regularization and the event-topic
affinity vectors as Base+Reg+Aff.
For the parameter setting, we empirically set A to
40, γ to 50A , τ to 1, β to 0.01, α to 1, ι to 10, ϵ to 1,
and the duration regularization parameter λ to 0.01.
When a new event k is created, the inner popular-
ity bias term η0k is set to 1, and the factors in event-
topic affinity vectors 77k are all set to 0. We run the
stochastic EM sampling scheme for 300 iterations.
After Gibbs sampling assigns each variable a value
at the end of each iteration, we update the values of
η0k and 77k for the existing events using gradient de-
scent.

Usually we are interested in the most popular
events on Twitter. We therefore assess whether the
top events are meaningful. For each method, we
rank the detected events based on the number of
tweets assigned to them and then pick the top-30
events for each method. We randomly mix these
events and ask two human judges to label them.
The judges are given 100 randomly selected tweets
for each event (or all tweets if an event contains
less than 100 tweets). The judges can use exter-
nal sources to help them. If an event is meaningful
based on the 100 sample tweets, a score of 1 is given.
Otherwise it is scored 0. The inter-annotator agree-
ment score is 0.744 using Cohen’s kappa, showing
substantial agreement. Finally we treat an event as
meaningful if both judges have scored it 1.
Table 2 shows the performance in terms of
precision@K, and Table 1 shows the top 5 events
of our model (i.e., Base+Reg+Aff). We have the
following findings from the results: (1) Our base
model performs quite poorly for the top events while
Base+Reg and Base+Reg+Aff perform much bet-
ter. This shows that the duration-based regular-
ization is critical in finding meaningful events. A
close examination shows that the base model clus-
ters many general topic tweets as events, such as
tweets about transportation and music and even
foursquare tweets. (2) TimeUserLDA performs well
for the very top events (P@5 and P@10) but its
performance drops for lower-ranked events (P@20
and P@30), similar to what was reported by Diao
et al. (2012). A close examination shows that this
method is good at finding major events that do not
have strong topic association and thus attract most
people’s attention, e.g. earthquakes, but not good at
finding topic-oriented events such as some concerts
and sports games. This is because this method mixes
topics and events first and only detects events from
bursty topics in a second stage of postprocessing. In
contrast, our model performs well for topic-oriented
events. (3) The difference between Base+Reg and
Base+Reg+Aff is small, suggesting that the event-
topic affinity vectors are not crucial for event detec-
tion.

(we pick “Fathers’ day” to represent public festi-
vals, and ignore the similar events “Mothers’ day”
and “April fools”). We also pick one event shared
by three RCRP based models. We further ask one
of the judges to score the 100 tweets as either 1 or 0
based on their relevance to the event. The precision
of the 100 tweets for each event and each method is
shown in Table 3. We can see that again Base+Ref
and Base+Ref+Aff perform similarly, and both out-
perform the other two methods. We also take a
close look at the tweets and find that the false posi-
tives mislabeled by Base is mainly due to the long-
duration of the discovered events. For example, for
the event “Super Junior album release,” Base finds
other music-related tweets surrounding the peak pe-
riod of the event itself.
In summary, our evaluation on event quality
shows that (1) Using the non-parametric RCRP
model to identify events within the generative
model itself is advantageous over TimeUserLDA,
which identifies events by postprocessing. (2) The
duration-based regularization is crucial for finding
more meaningful events.

4.3 Event-Topic Association
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999826166666667">
Besides event identification, our model also finds the
association between events and topics through the
event-topic affinity vectors. The discovered event-
topic association can potentially be used for various
tasks. Here we conduct two experiments to demon-
strate its usefulness.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.983094">
Event Recommendation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986916666667">
Recall that to discover event-topic association, we
treat an event as an item and a tweet about the event
as indication of the user’s adoption of the item. Fol-
lowing this analogy with item recommendation, we
define an event recommendation task where the goal
is to recommend an event to users who have not
posted any tweet about the event but may potentially
be interested in the event. Intuitively, if a user’s topic
distribution is similar to the event-topic affinity vec-
tor of the event, then the user is likely to be inter-
ested in the event.
Specifically, we use the first two months’ data
(April and May 2012) as training data to learn all
the users’ topic distributions. We then use a ransom
subset of 250 training users and their tweets in June
to identify events in June as well as the event-topic
affinity vectors of these events. We pick 8 meaning-
ful events that are ranked high by all methods for
testing. For each event, we try to find among the
remaining 250 users those who may be interested
in the event and compare the results with ground
truth obtained by human judgment. Because it is
time consuming to obtain the ground truth for all 250
users, we randomly pick 100 of these 250 users for
testing purpose. For each test user and each event,
we manually inspect the user’s tweets around the
peak days of the event to judge whether she has com-
mented on the event. This is used as ground truth.
With our complete model Base+Reg+Aff, we can
simply rank the 100 test users in decreasing order of
77k &apos; zu. For the other methods, because we do not
have any parameter that directly encodes event-topic
association, we cannot rank users based on how sim-
ilar their topic distributions are to the event’s affinity
to topics. We instead adopt a collaborative filtering
strategy and rank the test users by their similarity
with those training users who have tweeted about
the event. Specifically, each of these methods pro-
duces a topic distribution θu for each user. In addi-
tion, for each test event these methods identify a list
of training users who have tweeted on it. By taking
the average topic distribution of these training users
and compute its cosine similarity with a test user’s
topic distribution, we can rank the 100 test users.
Since we have turned the recommendation task
into a ranking task, we use Average Precision, a
commonly used metric in information retrieval, to
compare the performance. Average Precision is the

average of the precision value obtained for the set
of top items existing after each relevant item is re-
trieved (Manning et al., 2008). We also rank the
8 events in decreasing order of their inner popular-
ity ηk learned by our complete model. The results
are shown in Table 4. We have the following find-
ings from the table. (1) Our complete method out-
performs the other methods for 6 out of the 8 test
events, suggesting that with the inferred event-topic
affinity vectors we can do better event recommen-
dation. (2) The improvement brought by the event-
topic affinity vectors, as reflected in the difference in
Average Precision between Base+Reg+Aff and Base
(or Base+Reg) is more pronounced for events with
lower inner popularity. Recall that the inner popu-
larity of an event shows the inherent popularity of
an event regardless of its association with any topic,
that is, an event with high inner popularity attracts
attention of many people regardless of their topic
interests, while an event with low inner popularity
tends to attract attention of certain people with simi-
lar topic interests. The finding above suggests that
the event-topic affinity vectors are especially use-
ful for recommending events that attract only certain
people’s attention, such as those related to sports,
music, etc.
One may wonder for the events with low inner
popularity why we could not achieve the same ef-
fect by Base or Base+Reg where we consider the
topic similarity of test users with training users who
have tweeted about the event. Our close examina-
tion shows that for these events although Base and
Base+Reg may identify relevant event tweets with
decent precision, the users they identify who have
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.982105">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.982888">
tweeted about the event may not share similar topic
interests. As a result, when we average these users’
topic interests, we cannot obtain a clear skewed
topic distribution that explains the event’s affinity
to different topics. In contrast, Base+Reg+Aff ex-
plicitly models the event-topic affinity vector and
prefers to assign a tweet to an event if its author’s
topic distribution is similar to the event’s affinity
vector. Through the training iterations, the users
who have tweeted about an event as identified by
Base+Reg+Aff will gradually converge to share sim-
ilar topic distributions.
Grouping Events by Topics
Finally, we show that the event-topic affinity vec-
tors can also be used to group events by topics. This
can potentially be used to better organize and present
popular events in social media. In Table 5 we show
a few highly related events for a few popular topics
in our Twitter data set. Specifically given a topic a
we rank the meaningful events that contain at least
70 tweets based on ηk,a. We can see from the table
that the events are indeed related to the correspond-
ing topic. The event “LionsXII 9-0 Sabah FA” is
particularly interesting in that it is highly related to
both the topic on Malay and the topic on soccer. (Li-
onsXII is a soccer team from Singapore and Sabah
FA is a soccer team from Malaysia.)

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980590909091">
In this paper, we propose a unified model to study
topics, events and users jointly. The base of our
method is a combination of an LDA-like model and
the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process, which
aims to model users’ longstanding personal topic in-
terests and events over time simultaneously. The Re-
current Chinese Restaurant Process is appealing in
the sense that it provides a principled dynamic non-
parametric model in which the number of events is
not fixed overtime. We further use a time duration-
based regularization to capture the fast emergence
and disappearance of events on Twitter, which is
effective to produce more meaningful events. Fi-
nally, we use an inner popularity bias parameter and
event-topic affinity vectors to interpret an event’s
inherent popularity and its affinity to different top-
ics. Our experiments quantitatively show that our
proposed model can effectively identify meaningful
events and accurately find relevant tweets for these
events. Furthermore, the event-topic association in-
ferred by our model can help an event recommenda-
tion task and organize events by topics.

<abstract confidence="0.997661565217391">With the rapid growth of social media, Twitter has become one of the most widely adopted platforms for people to post short and instant message. On the one hand, people tweets about their daily lives, and on the other hand, when major events happen, people also follow and tweet about them. Moreover, people’s posting behaviors on events are often closely tied to their personal interests. In this paper, we try to model topics, events and users on Twitter in a unified way. We propose a model which combines an LDA-like topic model and the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process to capture topics and events. We further propose a duration-based regularization component to find bursty events. We also propose to use event-topic affinity vectors to model the association between events and topics. Our experiments shows that our model can accurately identify meaningful events and the event-topic affinity vectors are effective for event recommendation and grouping events by topics.</abstract>

Our work also jointly models topics and events, but different from previous work, we do not assume that every document (tweet in our case) belongs to an event, which is important because Twitter contains many personal posts unrelated to major events. Collaborative filtering with LDA: Part of our model is inspired by work on collaborative filtering based on probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008). Recently there has been some work combining LDA with PMF to recommend items with textual content such as news articles and advertisements (Wang and Blei, 2011; Agarwal and Chen, 2010). They use topics to interpret the latent structure of users and items. We borrow their idea but our items are events, which are not known and have to be discovered by our model. 1870 Figure 1: Plate notation for the whole model, in which pseudo-observed variables and distributions based on empirical counts are shown as dotted nodes. 3 Our Model In this section, we present our model for topics, events and users on Twitter.

The vector ηk represents the event’s affinity to topics. 0k is a bias term that represents the inner popularity of an event regardless of its affinity to any topic. We further assume that each tweet has another pseudo-observed variable ct,i that is set to 1. For topic tweets, ct,i gets a value of 1 with probability 1. For event tweets, ct,i is generated by a Gaussian distribution with mean equal to 0st,i + ηst,i &apos; zut,i, where zu is an A-dimensional vector denoting the empirical topic distribution of user u’s tweets. This treatment follows the practice of fLDA by Agarwal and Chen (2010). Let �Cu,a be the number of tweets by user u assigned to topic a, based on the values of the latent variables y and z. Then ct,i —Gaussian( 0st,i + ηst,i &apos; zut,i, ϵ−1), where ϵ is a parameter. We generate ηk and 0k using Gaussian priors once event k emerges. The generation of the variables c is shown in bold and blue in Figure 2. 3.4 Inference We train the model using a stochastic EM sampling scheme. In this scheme, we alternate between Gibbs sampling and gradient descent. In the Gibbs sampling part, we fix the values of 0k and ηk for each event k, and then we sample the latent variables yt,i</context>

Temporal topic modeling: A number of models have been proposed for the temporal aspect of topics (Blei and Lafferty, 2006; Wang and McCallum, 2006; Wang et al., 2007; Hong et al., 2011), but most of them fix the number of topics. The Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process (Ahmed and Xing, ) was proposed to model the life cycles of topics and allows an infinite number of topics. It has later been combined with LDA to model both topics and events in news streams and social media streams (Ahmed et al., 2011; Tang and Yang, 2012). Our work also jointly models topics and events, but different from previous work, we do not assume that every document (tweet in our case) belongs to an event, which is important because Twitter contains many personal posts unrelated to major events. Collaborative filtering with LDA: Part of our model is inspired by work on collaborative filtering based on probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008). Recently there has been some work combining LDA with PMF to recommend items with textual content such as news articles and advertisements (Wang </context>

Generation of these variables r is shown in bold and blue in Figure 2. 3.3 Event-Topic Affinity Vectors So far in our model topics and events are not related. However, many events are highly related to certain topics. For example, a concert is related to music while a football match is related to sports. We would like to capture these relations between topics and events. One way to do it is to assume that event tweets also have topical words sampled from the event’s topic distribution, something similar to the models by Ahmed et al. (2011) and by Tang and Yang (2012). However, our prelimiary experiments show that this idea does not work well on Twitter, mainly because tweets are too short. Here we explore another approach inspired by recommendation methods based on probabilistic matrix factorization (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008). The idea is that when a user posts a tweet about an event, we can treat the event as an item and this posting be1872 havior as adoption of the item. If we assume that the adoption behavior is influenced by some latent factors, i.e. the latent topics, then basically we would like the topic distribution</context>

We further use an LDA-like model (Blei et al., 2003) to discover topics and the Recurrent Chinese Restaurant Process (Ahmed and Xing, ) to discover events. Details are given in Section 3.1. Our major contributions lie in two novel modifications to the base model described above. The first is a duration-based regularization component that punishes long-term events (Section 3.2). Because events on Twitter tend to be bursty, this modification presumably can produce more meaningful events. More specifically, we borrow the idea of using pseudo-observed variables to regularize graphical models (Balasubramanyan and Cohen, 2013), and carefully design the pseudo-observed variable in our task to capture the burstiness of events. The second modification is adding event-topic affinity vectors inspired by PMF-based collaborative filtering (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008) (Section 3.3). It uses the latent topics to explain users’ preferences of events and subsequently infers the association between topics and events. We use a real Twitter data set consisting of 500 users to evaluate our model (Section 4). We find that the model can discover meaningful topics and events.

Dt is the total number of tweets (both event-related and topic tweets), while Nt represents the number event-related tweets in epoch t. 3.2 Regularization on Event Durations As we have pointed out, events on Twitter tend to be bursty, i.e. the duration of an event tends to be short, but this characteristic is not captured by RCRP. While there can be different ways to incorporate this intuition, here we adopt the idea of regularization using pseudo-observed variables proposed recently by Balasubramanyan and Cohen (2013). We introduce a pseudo-observed binary variable rt,i for each tweet, where the value of rt,i is set to 1 for all tweets. We assume that this variable is dependent on the hidden variables y and s. Specifically, if yt,i is 0, i.e. the tweet is topic-related, then rt,i gets a value of 1 with probability 1. If yt,i is 1, then we look at all the tweets that belong to event st,i. Our goal is to make sure that this tweet is temporally close to these other tweets. So we assume that rt,i gets a value of 1 with probability exp(− ∑Tt′=1,|t′−t|&gt;1 A|t − t′|nst,i,t′), where nst,i,t′ is the number of tweets</context>

To model the relation between users and topics, we assume each user u has a multinomial distribution over topics, denoted as θu. As we have discussed, we separate tweets into two categories, topic tweets and event tweets. Separation of these two categories is done through a latent variable y sampled from a user-specific Bernoulli distribution Tru. For topic tweets, the topic is sampled from the corresponding user’s topic distribution θu. For event tweets, the event is sampled according to RCRP. We now briefly review RCRP. Generally speaking, RCRP assumes a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) (Blackwell and MacQueen, 1973) for items within an epoch and chains up the CRPs in adjacent epochs along the timeline. Specifically, in our case, the generative process can be described as follows. Tweets come in according to their timestamps. In the t-th epoch, for the i-th tweet, we first flip a biased coin based on probability Tru to decide whether this tweet is event-related. If it is, then we need to decide which event it belongs to. It could be an existing event that has at least one related tweet in the 1871 previous epoch or the current epoch, or it could be a new event. Let nk,t−1 denote the number of tweets relat</context>

Because our topic discovery mechanism is fairly standard and a quick inspection shows that the discovered topics are generally meaningful and comparable to those discovered by standard LDA, here we do not focus on evaluation of topics. In Section 4.2 we evaluate the quality of the discovered events. In Section 4.3 we show how the discovered event-topic affinity vectors can be useful. For comparison, we consider an existing method called TimeUserLDA introduced in our previous work (Diao et al., 2012). TimeUserLDA also models topics and events by separating topic tweets from event tweets. However, it groups event tweets into a fixed number of bursty topics and then uses a twostate machine in a postprocessing step to identify events from these bursty topics. Thus, events are not directly modeled within the generative process itself. In contrast, events are inherent in our generative model. We do not compare with other event detection methods because our objective is not online event detection. We also compare our final model with two degenerate versions of it. We refer to the base model des</context>

We have the following findings from the results: (1) Our base model performs quite poorly for the top events while Base+Reg and Base+Reg+Aff perform much better. This shows that the duration-based regularization is critical in finding meaningful events. A close examination shows that the base model clusters many general topic tweets as events, such as tweets about transportation and music and even foursquare tweets. (2) TimeUserLDA performs well for the very top events (P@5 and P@10) but its performance drops for lower-ranked events (P@20 and P@30), similar to what was reported by Diao et al. (2012). A close examination shows that this method is good at finding major events that do not have strong topic association and thus attract most people’s attention, e.g. earthquakes, but not good at finding topic-oriented events such as some concerts and sports games. This is because this method mixes topics and events first and only detects events from bursty topics in a second stage of postprocessing. In contrast, our model performs well for topic-oriented events.

The first is a duration-based regularization component that punishes long-term events (Section 3.2). Because events on Twitter tend to be bursty, this modification presumably can produce more meaningful events. More specifically, we borrow the idea of using pseudo-observed variables to regularize graphical models (Balasubramanyan and Cohen, 2013), and carefully design the pseudo-observed variable in our task to capture the burstiness of events. The second modification is adding event-topic affinity vectors inspired by PMF-based collaborative filtering (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008) (Section 3.3). It uses the latent topics to explain users’ preferences of events and subsequently infers the association between topics and events. We use a real Twitter data set consisting of 500 users to evaluate our model (Section 4). We find that the model can discover meaningful topics and events. Comparison with our base model and with an existing model for event discovery on Twitter shows that the two modifications are both effective.

It has later been combined with LDA to model both topics and events in news streams and social media streams (Ahmed et al., 2011; Tang and Yang, 2012). Our work also jointly models topics and events, but different from previous work, we do not assume that every document (tweet in our case) belongs to an event, which is important because Twitter contains many personal posts unrelated to major events. Collaborative filtering with LDA: Part of our model is inspired by work on collaborative filtering based on probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) (Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008). Recently there has been some work combining LDA with PMF to recommend items with textual content such as news articles and advertisements (Wang and Blei, 2011; Agarwal and Chen, 2010). They use topics to interpret the latent structure of users and items. We borrow their idea but our items are events, which are not known and have to be discovered by our model. 1870 Figure 1: Plate notation for the whole model, in which pseudo-observed variables and distributions based on empirical counts are shown as dotted nodes. 3 Our Model In this section, we present our model for topics, events and users </context>

Predicting the success of literary works is a
curious question among publishers and aspir-
ing writers alike. We examine the quantitative
connection, if any, between writing style and
successful literature. Based on novels over
several different genres, we probe the predic-
tive power of statistical stylometry in discrim-
inating successful literary works, and identify
characteristic stylistic elements that are more
prominent in successful writings. Our study
reports for the first time that statistical stylom-
etry can be surprisingly effective in discrim-
inating highly successful literature from less
successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up
to 84%. Closer analyses lead to several new
insights into characteristics of the writing style
in successful literature, including findings that
are contrary to the conventional wisdom with
respect to good writing style and readability.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973953488372">
Predicting the success of novels is a curious ques-
tion among publishers, professional book reviewers,
aspiring and even expert writers alike. There are po-
tentially many influencing factors, some of which
concern the intrinsic content and quality of the book,
such as interestingness, novelty, style of writing, and
engaging storyline, but external factors such as so-
cial context and even luck can play a role. As a re-
sult, recognizing successful literary work is a hard
task even for experts working in the publication in-
dustries. Indeed, even some of the best sellers and
award winners can go through several rejections be-
fore they are picked up by a publisher.1
Perhaps due to its obvious complexity of the prob-
lem, there has been little previous work that attempts
to build statistical models that predict the success of
literary works based on their intrinsic content and
quality. Some previous studies do touch on the no-
tion of stylistic aspects in successful literature, e.g.,
extensive studies in Literature discuss literary styles
of significant authors (e.g., Elleg˚ard (1962), Mc-
Gann (1998)), while others consider content char-
acteristics such as plots, characteristics of charac-
ters, action, emotion, genre, cast, of the best-selling
novels and blockbuster movies (e.g., Harvey (1953),
Hall (2012), Yun (2011)).
All these studies however, are qualitative in na-
ture, as they rely on the knowledge and insights of
human experts on literature. To our knowledge, no
prior work has undertaken a systematic quantitative
investigation on the overarching characterization of
the writing style in successful literature. In consid-
eration of widely different styles of authorship (e.g.,
Escalante et al. (2011), Peng et al. (2003), Argamon
et al. (2003)), it is not even readily clear whether
there might be common stylistic elements that help
discriminating highly successful ones from less suc-
cessful counterpart.
In this work, we present the first study that in-
vestigates this unstudied and unexpected connection
between stylistic elements and the literary success.
The key findings of our research reveal that there
exists distinct linguistic patterns shared among suc-

cessful literature, at least within the same genre,
making it possible to build a model with surprisingly
high accuracy (up to 84%) in predicting the success
of a novel. This result is surprising for two reasons.
First, we tackle the hard task of predicting the suc-
cess of novels written by previously unseen authors,
avoiding incidental learning of authorship signature,
since previous research demonstrated that one can
achieve very high accuracy in authorship attribution
(as high as 96% in some experimental setup) (e.g.,
Raghavan et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2012)). Sec-
ond, we aim to discriminate highly successful nov-
els from less successful, but nonetheless published
books written by professional writers, which are un-
doubtedly of higher quality than average writings.
It is important to note that the task we tackle here
is much harder than discriminating highly success-
ful works from those that have not even passed the
scrutinizing eyes of publishers.
In order to quantify the success of literary works,
and to obtain corresponding gold standard labels,
one needs to first define “success”. For practi-
cal convenience, we largely rely on the download
counts available at Project Gutenberg as a surrogate
to quantify the success of novels. For a small num-
ber of novels however, we also consider award re-
cipients (e.g., Pulitzer, Nobel), and Amazon’s sales
records to define a novel’s success. We also ex-
tend our empirical study to movie scripts, where we
quantify the success of movies based on the aver-
age review scores at imdb.com. We leave analysis
based on other measures of literary success as future
research.
In this study, we do not attempt to separate out
success based on literary quality (award winners)
from success based on popularity (commercial hit,
often in spite of bad literary quality), mainly because
it is not practically easy to determine whether the
high download counts are due to only one reason or
the other. We expect that in many cases, the two
different aspects of success are likely to coincide,
however. In the case of the corpus obtained from
Project Gutenberg, where most of our experiments
are conducted, we expect that the download counts
are more indicative of success based on the literary
quality (which then may have resulted in popularity)
rather than popularity without quality.
We examine several genres in fiction and movie

2 Dataset Construction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994930777777778">
For our experiments, we procure novels from project
Gutenberg2. Project Gutenberg houses over 40, 000
books available for free download in electronic for-
mat and provides a catalog containing brief descrip-
tions (title, author, genre, language, download count,
etc.) of these books. We experiment with genres in
Table 1, which have sufficient number of books al-
lowing us to construct reasonably sized datasets.
We use the download counts in Gutenberg-catalog

as a surrogate to measure the degree of success of
novels. For each genre, we determine a lower bound
(T+) and an upper bound (T_) of download counts as
shown in Table 1 to categorize the available books
as more successful and less successful respectively.
These thresholds are set to obtain at least 50 books
for each class, and for each genre. To balance the
data, for each genre, we construct a dataset of 100
novels (50 per class).
We make sure that no single author has more than
2 books in the resulting dataset, and in the major-
ity of the cases, only one book has been taken from
each author.3 Furthermore, we make sure that the
books from the same author do not show up in both
training and test data. These constraints make sure
that we learn general linguistic patterns of success-
ful novels, rather than a particular writing style of a
few successful authors.

IV. Distribution of Constituents: PCFG gram-
mar rules are overly specific to draw a big picture
on the distribution of large, recursive syntactic units.
We hypothesize that the distribution of constituents
can serve this purpose, and that it will reveal inter-
esting and more interpretable insights into writing
styles in highly successful literature. Despite its rel-
ative simplicity, we are not aware of previous work
that looks at the distribution of constituents directly.
In particular, we are interested in examining the dis-
tribution of phrasal and/or clausal tags as follows:
(i) Phrasal tag percent (PHR) - percentage distribu-
tion of phrasal tags.4 (ii) Clausal tag percent (CLS)
- percentage distribution of clausal tags.
V. Distribution of Sentiment and Connotation:
Finally, we examine whether the distribution of sen-
timent and connotation words, and their polarity, has
any correlation with respect to the success of literary
works. We are not aware of any previous work that
looks into this connection.

4 Prediction Performance
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.929443022727273">
We use LibLinear SVM (Fan et al., 2008) with
L2 tuned over training data, and all performance is
based on 5-fold cross validation. We take 1000 sen-
tences from the beginning of each book. POS fea-
tures are encoded as unit normalized frequency and
all other features are encoded as tf-idf.5
4The percentage of any phrasal tag is the count of occurrence
of that tag over the sum of counts of all phrasal tags.
5POS tags are obtained using the Stanford POS tagger
(Toutanova and Manning, 2000), and parse trees are based on
the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).
Prediction Results Table 2 shows the classifica-
tion results. The best performance reaches as high
as 84% in accuracy. In fact, in all genres except
for history, the best performance is at least 74%,
if not higher. Another notable observation is that
even in the poetry genre, which is not prose, the ac-
curacy gets as high as 74%. This level of perfor-
mance is not entirely anticipated, given that (1) the
test data consists of books written only by previously
unseen authors, and (2) each author has widely dif-
ferent writing style, and (3) we do not have training
data at scale, and (4) we aim to tackle the hard task
of discriminating highly successful ones from less
successful, but nonetheless successful ones, as all of
them were, after all, good enough to be published.6
Prediction with Varying Thresholds of Down-
load Counts Before we proceed to comprehensive
analysis of writing style that are prominent in more
successful literature (�5), in Table 3, we present how
the prediction accuracy varies as we adjust the defi-
nition of more-successful and less-successful litera-
ture, by gradually increasing (decreasing) the thresh-
old T− (T+). As we reduce the gap between T− and
T+, the performance decreases, which shows that in-
deed there are notable statistical differences in lin-
guistic patterns between novels with high and low
download counts, and the stylistic difference mono-
tonically increases (thereby higher prediction accu-
racy) as we increase the gap between two classes.
6In our pilot study, we also experimented with the binary
classification task of discriminating highly successful ones from
those that are not even published (unpublished online novels),
and it was a much easier task as expected.

It is apparent from Table 2 that unigram features
yield curiously high performance in many genres.
We therefore examine discriminative unigrams for
ADVENTURE, shown in Table 4. Interestingly, less
successful books rely on verbs that are explicitly de-
scriptive of actions and emotions (e.g., “wanted”,
“took”, “promised”, “cried”, “cheered”, etc.), while
more successful books favor verbs that describe
thought-processing (e.g., “recognized”, “remem-
bered”), and verbs that serve the purpose of quotes
and reports (e.g,. “say”). Also, more successful
books use discourse connectives and prepositions
more frequently, while less successful books rely
more on topical words that could be almost clich´e,
e.g., “love”, typical locations, and involve more ex-
treme (e.g., “breathless”) and negative words (e.g.,
“risk”).

tribution of sentiment and connotation for the entire
words. As can be seen in Table 5 – Top, there are
not notable differences. However, when we compare
distribution only with respect to discriminative uni-
grams only (i.e., features with non-zero weights), as

<bodyText confidence="0.998303947368421">
Summarized analysis of POS distribution across all
genres is reported in Table 6. It can be seen that
prepositions, nouns, pronouns, determiners and ad-
jectives are predictive of highly successful books
whereas less successful books are characterized by
higher percentage of verbs, adverbs, and foreign
words. Per genre distributions of POS tags are vi-
sualized in Figure 1. Interestingly, some POS tags
show almost universal patterns (e.g., prepositions
(IN), NNP, WP, VB), while others are more genre-
specific.
In Relation to Journalism Style The work of
Douglas and Broussard (2000) reveals that informa-
tive writing (journalism) involves increased use of
nouns, prepositions, determiners and coordinating
conjunctions whereas imaginative writing (novels)
involves more use of verbs and adverbs, as has been
also confirmed by Rayson et al. (2001). Compar-
ing their findings with Table 6, we find that highly

5.4 Distribution of Constituents
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999267083333333">
It can be seen in Table 2 that deep syntactic fea-
tures expressed in terms of different encodings of
production rules consistently yield good perfor-
mance across almost all genres. Production rules
are overly specific to gain more generalized, in-
terpretable, high-level insights however (Feng et
al., 2012). Therefore, similarly as word categories
(POS), we consider the categories of nonterminal
nodes of the parse trees, in particular, phrasal and
clausal tags, as they represent the gist of constituent
structure that goes beyond shallow syntactic infor-
mation represented by POS.
Table 8 shows how the distribution of phrasal and
clausal tags differ for successful books when com-
puted over all genres. Positive (negative) DIFF val-
ues indicate that the corresponding tags are favored
in more successful (less successful) books when
counted across all genres. We also report the num-
ber of genres (#Genres) in which the individual dif-
ference is positive / negative.
In terms of phrasal tags, we find that more suc-
cessful books are composed of higher percentage of
PP, NP and wh-noun phrases (WHNP), whereas less
successful books are composed of higher percentage
of VP, adverb phrases (ADVP), interjections (INTJ)
and fragments (FRAG). Notice that this observation
is inline with our earlier findings with respect to the
distribution of POS.
In regard to clausal tags, more successful books
involve more clausal tags that are necessary for com-
plex sentence structure and inverted sentence struc-
ture (SBAR, SBARQ and SQ) whereas less success-
ful books rely more on simple sentence structure (S).
Figure 2 shows the visualization of the distribution
of these phrasal and clausal tags.
It is also worth to mention that phrasal and clausal

tags alone can yield classification performance that
are generally better than that of POS tags, in spite of
the very small feature set (26 tags in total). In fact,
constituent tags deliver the best performance in case
of historical fiction genre (Table 2).
Connection to Readability Pitler and Nenkova
(2008) provide comprehensive insights into assess-
ment of readability. In their work, among the most
discriminating features characterizing text with bet-
ter readability is increased use of verb phrases (VP).
Interestingly, contrary to the conventional wisdom –
that readability is of desirable quality of good writ-
ings – our findings in Table 2 suggest that the in-
creased use of VP correlates strongly with the writ-
ing style of the opposite spectrum of highly success-
ful novels.
As a secondary way of probing the connection be-
tween readability and the writing style of successful
literature, we also compute two different readabil-
ity measures that have been used widely in prior
literature (e.g., Sierra et al. (1992), Blumenstock
(2008), Ali et al. (2010)): (i) Flesch reading ease
score (Flesch, 1948), (ii) Gunning FOG index (Gun-
ning, 1968). The overall weighted average readabil-
ity scores are reported in Table 7. Again, we find that
less successful novels have higher readability com-
pared to more successful ones.
The work of Sawyer et al. (2008) provides yet
another interesting contrasting point, where the au-
thors found that award winning academic papers in
marketing journals correlate strongly with increased
readability, characterized by higher percentage of
simple sentences. We conjecture that this opposite
trend is likely to be due to difference between fic-
tion and nonfiction, leaving further investigation as
future research.
In sum, our analysis reveals an intriguing and
unexpected observation on the connection between
readability and the literary success — that they cor-
relate into the opposite directions. Surely our find-
ings only demonstrate correlation, not to be con-

two classification options: (1) KL-divergence based,
and (2) unigram-feature based.
Although KL-divergence based prediction was
not part of the classifiers that we explored in the pre-
vious sections, we include it here mainly to provide
better insights as to which well-known books share
closer structural similarity to either more or less suc-
cessful writing style. As a probability model, we use
the distributions of phrasal tags, as those can give us
insights on deep syntactic structure while suppress-
ing potential noises due to topical variances. Table 9
shows symmetrised KL-divergence between each of
the previously unseen novels and the collection of
books from Gutenberg corresponding to more suc-
cessful (less successful) labels. For prediction, the
label with smaller KL is chosen.
Based only on the distribution of 26 phrasal tags,
the KL divergence classifier is able to make correct
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.974533">

<bodyText confidence="0.999916136363636">
predictions on 7 out of 10 books, a surprisingly high
performance based on mere 26 features. Of course,
considering only the distribution of phrasal tags is
significantly less informed than considering numer-
ous other features that have shown substantially bet-
ter performance, e.g., unigrams and CFG rewrite
rules. Therefore, we also present the SVM classi-
fier trained on unigram features. It turns out uni-
gram features are powerful enough to make correct
predictions for all ten books in Table 9.
Hemingway and Minimalism It is good to think
about where and why KL-divergence-based ap-
proach fails. In fact, when we included Heming-
way’s The Old Man and the Sea into the test set, we
were expecting some level of confusions when rely-
ing only on high-level syntactic structure, as Hem-
ingway’s signature style is minimalism, with 70%
of his sentences corresponding to simple sentences.
Not surprisingly, more adequately informed clas-
sifiers, e.g., SVM with unigram features, are still
able to recognize Hemingway’s writings as those of
highly successful ones.

<bodyText confidence="0.999926133333333">
In order to obtain less successful books, we consider
the Amazon seller’s rank included in the product de-
tails of a book. The less successful books considered
in Table 9 had an Amazon seller’s rank beyond 200k
(higher rank indicating less commercial success) ex-
cept Dan Brown’s The lost symbol, which we in-
cluded mainly because of negative critiques it had
attracted from media despite its commercial success.
As shown in Table 9, all three classifiers make (ar-
guably) correct predictions on Dan Brown’s book.9
This result also supports our earlier assumption on
the nature of novels available at Project Gutenberg
— that they would be more representative of liter-
ary success than general popularity (with or without
literary quality).

are likely to be more informal. Also, what to keep
in mind is that much of the success of movies de-
pends on factors beyond the quality of writing of the
scripts, such as the quality of acting, the popularity
of actors, budgets, artistic taste of directors and pro-
ducers, editing and so forth.
We use the Movie Script Dataset introduced in
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee (2011). It in-
cludes the dialogue scripts of 617 movies. The aver-
age rating of all movies is 6.87. We consider movies
with IMDb rating &gt; 8 as “more successful”, the
ones with IMDb rating &lt; 5.5 as “less successful”.
We combine all the dialogues of each movie and
filter out the movies with less than 200 sentences.
There are 11 genres (“ADVENTURE”, “FANTASY”,
“ROMANCE”, “THRILLER”, “ACTION”, “COMEDY”,
“CRIME”, “DRAMA”, “HORROR”, “MYSTERY”, “SCI-
FI”) with 15 movies or more per class, we take 15
movies per class and perform classification tasks
with the same experiment setting as Table 2.
Table 10, we show some of the example genres
with relatively successful outcome, reaching as high
as 89.3% accuracy in FANTASY genre. We would
like to note however that in many other genres, the
prediction did not work as well as it did for the novel
domain. We suspect that there are at least two rea-
sons for this: it must be partly due to very limited
data size — only 15 instances per class with the rat-
ing threshold we selected for defining the success of

best of our knowledge, our work is the first that pro-
vides quantitative insights into the unstudied con-
nection between the writing style and the success of
literary works. There have been some previous work
that aims to gain insights into the secret recipe of
successful books, but most were qualitative, based
only on a dozen of books, focusing mainly on the
high-level content of the books, such as the per-
sonalities of protagonists, antagonists, the nature of
plots (e.g., Harvey (1953), Yun (2011)). In con-
trast, our work examines a considerably larger col-
lection of books (800 in total) over eight different
sub-genres, providing insights into lexical, syntac-
tic, and discourse patterns that characterize the writ-
ing styles commonly shared among the successful
literature. Another relevant work has been on a dif-
ferent domain of movies (Yun, 2011), however, the
prediction is based only on external, non-textual in-
formation such as the reputation of actors and direc-
tors, and the power of distribution systems etc, with-
out analyzing the actual content of the movie scripts.
Text quality and readability: Louis (2012) ex-
plored various features that measure the quality of
text, which has some high-level connections to our
work. Combining the insights from Louis (2012)
with our results, we find that the characteristics of
text quality explored in Louis (2012), readability of
text in particular, do not correspond to the prominent
writing style of highly successful literature. There
have been a number of other work that focused on
predicting and measuring readability (e.g., Kate et
al. (2010), Pitler and Nenkova (2008), Schwarm and
Ostendorf (2005), Heilman and Eskenazi (2006) and
Collins-Thompson et al. (2004)) employing various
linguistic features.
There is an important difference however, in re-
gard to the nature of the selected text for analysis:
most studies in readability focus on differentiating
good writings from noticeably bad writings, often
involving machine generated text or those written
by ESL students. In contrast, our work essentially
deals with differentiating good writings from even
better writings. After all, all the books that we an-
alyzed are written by expert writers who passed the
scrutinizing eyes of publishers, hence it is reason-
able to expect that the writing quality of even less
successful books is respectful.
Predicting success among academic papers: In
the domain of academic papers, which belongs to
the broad genre of non-fiction, the work of Sawyer
et al. (2008) investigated the stylistic characteris-
tics of award winning papers in marketing journals,
and found that the readability plays an important
role. Combined with our study which focuses on fic-
tion and creative writing, it suggests that the recipe
for successful publications can be very different de-
pending on whether it belongs to fiction or nonfic-
tion. The work of Bergsma et al. (2012) is also
somewhat relevant to ours in that their work in-
cluded differentiating the writing styles of workshop
papers from major conference papers, where the lat-
ter would be generally considered to be more suc-
cessful.

<bodyText confidence="0.999978476190476">
We presented the first quantitative study that learns
to predict the success of literary works based on their
writing styles. Our empirical results demonstrated
that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effec-
tive in discriminating successful literature, achiev-
ing accuracy up to 84% in the novel domain and
89% in the movie domain. Furthermore, our study
resulted in several insights including: lexical and
syntactic elements of successful styles, the connec-
tion between successful writing style and readabil-
ity, the connection between sentiment / connotation
and the literary success, and last but not least, com-
parative insights between successful writing styles
of fiction and nonfiction.

<abstract confidence="0.9992484">Predicting the success of literary works is a curious question among publishers and aspiring writers alike. We examine the quantitative if any, between style successful literature. Based on novels over several different genres, we probe the predictive power of statistical stylometry in discriminating successful literary works, and identify characteristic stylistic elements that are more prominent in successful writings. Our study reports for the first time that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating highly successful literature from less successful counterpart, achieving accuracy up to 84%. Closer analyses lead to several new insights into characteristics of the writing style in successful literature, including findings that are contrary to the conventional wisdom with respect to good writing style and readability.</abstract>

All these studies however, are qualitative in nature, as they rely on the knowledge and insights of human experts on literature. To our knowledge, no prior work has undertaken a systematic quantitative investigation on the overarching characterization of the writing style in successful literature. In consideration of widely different styles of authorship (e.g., Escalante et al. (2011), Peng et al. (2003), Argamon et al. (2003)), it is not even readily clear whether there might be common stylistic elements that help discriminating highly successful ones from less successful counterpart. In this work, we present the first study that investigates this unstudied and unexpected connection between stylistic elements and the literary success.

Predicting success among academic papers: In the domain of academic papers, which belongs to the broad genre of non-fiction, the work of Sawyer et al. (2008) investigated the stylistic characteristics of award winning papers in marketing journals, and found that the readability plays an important role. Combined with our study which focuses on fiction and creative writing, it suggests that the recipe for successful publications can be very different depending on whether it belongs to fiction or nonfiction. The work of Bergsma et al. (2012) is also somewhat relevant to ours in that their work included differentiating the writing styles of workshop papers from major conference papers, where the latter would be generally considered to be more successful. 9 Conclusion We presented the first quantitative study that learns to predict the success of literary works based on their writing styles. Our empirical results demonstrated that statistical stylometry can be surprisingly effective in discriminating successful literature, achieving accuracy up to 84% in the novel domain and 89% in the movie domain.

Interestingly, contrary to the conventional wisdom – that readability is of desirable quality of good writings – our findings in Table 2 suggest that the increased use of VP correlates strongly with the writing style of the opposite spectrum of highly successful novels. As a secondary way of probing the connection between readability and the writing style of successful literature, we also compute two different readability measures that have been used widely in prior literature (e.g., Sierra et al. (1992), Blumenstock (2008), Ali et al. (2010)): (i) Flesch reading ease score (Flesch, 1948), (ii) Gunning FOG index (Gunning, 1968). The overall weighted average readability scores are reported in Table 7. Again, we find that less successful novels have higher readability compared to more successful ones. The work of Sawyer et al. (2008) provides yet another interesting contrasting point, where the authors found that award winning academic papers in marketing journals correlate strongly with increased readability, characterized by higher percentage of simple sentences.

It can be seen that prepositions, nouns, pronouns, determiners and adjectives are predictive of highly successful books whereas less successful books are characterized by higher percentage of verbs, adverbs, and foreign words. Per genre distributions of POS tags are visualized in Figure 1. Interestingly, some POS tags show almost universal patterns (e.g., prepositions (IN), NNP, WP, VB), while others are more genrespecific. In Relation to Journalism Style The work of Douglas and Broussard (2000) reveals that informative writing (journalism) involves increased use of nouns, prepositions, determiners and coordinating conjunctions whereas imaginative writing (novels) involves more use of verbs and adverbs, as has been also confirmed by Rayson et al.

V.

We are not aware of any previous work that looks into this connection. 4 Prediction Performance We use LibLinear SVM (Fan et al., 2008) with L2 tuned over training data, and all performance is based on 5-fold cross validation. We take 1000 sentences from the beginning of each book.

This result is surprising for two reasons. First, we tackle the hard task of predicting the success of novels written by previously unseen authors, avoiding incidental learning of authorship signature, since previous research demonstrated that one can achieve very high accuracy in authorship attribution (as high as 96% in some experimental setup) (e.g., Raghavan et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2012)). Second, we aim to discriminate highly successful novels from less successful, but nonetheless published books written by professional writers, which are undoubtedly of higher quality than average writings. It is important to note that the task we tackle here is much harder than discriminating highly successful works from those that have not even passed the scrutinizing eyes of publishers. In order to quantify the success of literary works, and to obtain corresponding gold standard labels, one needs to first define “success”.

I. Lexical Choices: unigrams and bigrams. II. Distribution of Word Categories: Many previous studies have shown that the distribution of part-of-speech (POS) tags alone can reveal surprising insights on genre and authorship (e.g., Koppel and Schler (2003)), hence we examine their distributions with respect to the success of literary works. III. Distribution of Grammar Rules: Recent studies reported that features based on CFG rules are helpful in authorship attribution (e.g., Raghavan et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2012)). We experiment with four different encodings of production rules: • r: lexicalized production rules (all production rules, including those with terminals) • rG: lexicalized production rules prepended with the grandparent node. • ry: unlexicalized production rules (all production rules except those with terminals). • ryG: unlexicalized production rules prepended with the grandparent node. 1755 FEATURE GENRE Avg Avg w/o History Adven Myster Fiction Histor Love Poetr Sci-fi Short POS 74.0 63.9 72.0 47.0 65.9 63.0 63.0 67.0 64.5 66.9 Unigram 84.0 73.0 75.0 60.0 82.0 71.0 61.0 57.0 70.3 71.8 Bigr</context>

Production rules are overly specific to gain more generalized, interpretable, high-level insights however (Feng et al., 2012). Therefore, similarly as word categories (POS), we consider the categories of nonterminal nodes of the parse trees, in particular, phrasal and clausal tags, as they represent the gist of constituent structure that goes beyond shallow syntactic information represented by POS. Table 8 shows how the distribution of phrasal and clausal tags differ for successful books when computed over all genres. Positive (negative) DIFF values indicate that the corresponding tags are favored in more successful (less successful) books when counted across all genres.

There have been some previous work that aims to gain insights into the secret recipe of successful books, but most were qualitative, based only on a dozen of books, focusing mainly on the high-level content of the books, such as the personalities of protagonists, antagonists, the nature of plots (e.g., Harvey (1953), Yun (2011)). In contrast, our work examines a considerably larger collection of books (800 in total) over eight different sub-genres, providing insights into lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns that characterize the writing styles commonly shared among the successful literature. Another relevant work has been on a different domain of movies (Yun, 2011), however, the prediction is based only on external, non-textual information such as the reputation of actors and directors, and the power of distribution systems etc, without analyzing the actual content of the movie scripts.

We take 1000 sentences from the beginning of each book. POS features are encoded as unit normalized frequency and all other features are encoded as tf-idf.5 4The percentage of any phrasal tag is the count of occurrence of that tag over the sum of counts of all phrasal tags. 5POS tags are obtained using the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000), and parse trees are based on the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). Prediction Results Table 2 shows the classification results. The best performance reaches as high as 84% in accuracy. In fact, in all genres except for history, the best performance is at least 74%, if not higher. Another notable observation is that even in the poetry genre, which is not prose, the accuracy gets as high as 74%. This level of performance is not entirely anticipated, given that (1) the test data consists of books written only by previously unseen authors, and (2) each author has widely different writing style, and (3) we do not have training data at scale, and (4) we aim to ta</context>

This result is surprising for two reasons. First, we tackle the hard task of predicting the success of novels written by previously unseen authors, avoiding incidental learning of authorship signature, since previous research demonstrated that one can achieve very high accuracy in authorship attribution (as high as 96% in some experimental setup) (e.g., Raghavan et al. (2010), Feng et al. (2012)). Second, we aim to discriminate highly successful novels from less successful, but nonetheless published books written by professional writers, which are undoubtedly of higher quality than average writings. It is important to note that the task we tackle here is much harder than discriminating highly successful works from those that have not even passed the scrutinizing eyes of publishers. In order to quantify the success of literary works, and to obtain corresponding gold standard labels, one needs to first define “success”. For practical convenience, we largely rely on </context>

As a secondary way of probing the connection between readability and the writing style of successful literature, we also compute two different readability measures that have been used widely in prior literature (e.g., Sierra et al. (1992), Blumenstock (2008), Ali et al. (2010)): (i) Flesch reading ease score (Flesch, 1948), (ii) Gunning FOG index (Gunning, 1968). The overall weighted average readability scores are reported in Table 7. Again, we find that less successful novels have higher readability compared to more successful ones. The work of Sawyer et al. (2008) provides yet another interesting contrasting point, where the authors found that award winning academic papers in marketing journals correlate strongly with increased readability, characterized by higher percentage of simple sentences. We conjecture that this opposite trend is likely to be due to difference between fiction and nonfiction, leaving further investigation as future research. In sum, our analysis reveals an intriguing and unexpected observation on the connection between readability and the literary success — that they correlate into the opposite directions.

Predicting success among academic papers: In the domain of academic papers, which belongs to the broad genre of non-fiction, the work of Sawyer et al. (2008) investigated the stylistic characteristics of award winning papers in marketing journals, and found that the readability plays an important role. Combined with our study which focuses on fiction and creative writing, it suggests that the recipe for successful publications can be very different depending on whether it belongs to fiction or nonfiction. The work of Bergsma et al. (2012) is also somewhat relevant to ours in that their work included differentiating the writing styles of workshop papers from major conference papers, where the latter would be generally considered to be more successf</context>

Text quality and readability: Louis (2012) explored various features that measure the quality of text, which has some high-level connections to our work. Combining the insights from Louis (2012) with our results, we find that the characteristics of text quality explored in Louis (2012), readability of text in particular, do not correspond to the prominent writing style of highly successful literature. There have been a number of other work that focused on predicting and measuring readability (e.g., Kate et al.

We take 1000 sentences from the beginning of each book. POS features are encoded as unit normalized frequency and all other features are encoded as tf-idf.5 4The percentage of any phrasal tag is the count of occurrence of that tag over the sum of counts of all phrasal tags. 5POS tags are obtained using the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000), and parse trees are based on the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). Prediction Results Table 2 shows the classification results. The best performance reaches as high as 84% in accuracy. In fact, in all genres except for history, the best performance is at least 74%, if not higher. Another notable observation is that even in the poetry genre, which is not prose, the accuracy gets as high as 74%. This level of performance is not entirely anticipated, given that (1) the test data consists of books written only by previously unseen authors, and (2) each author has widely different writin</context>

Some previous studies do touch on the notion of stylistic aspects in successful literature, e.g., extensive studies in Literature discuss literary styles of significant authors (e.g., Elleg˚ard (1962), McGann (1998)), while others consider content characteristics such as plots, characteristics of characters, action, emotion, genre, cast, of the best-selling novels and blockbuster movies (e.g., Harvey (1953), Hall (2012), Yun (2011)). All these studies however, are qualitative in nature, as they rely on the knowledge and insights of human experts on literature. To our knowledge, no prior work has undertaken a systematic quantitative investigation on the overarching characterization of the writing style in successful literature. In consideration of widely different styles of authorship (e.g., Escalante et al. (2011), Peng et al. (2003), Argamon et al. (2003)), it is not even readily clear whether there might be common stylistic elements that help discriminating highly successful ones from less successful counterpart. In t</context>

There have been some previous work that aims to gain insights into the secret recipe of successful books, but most were qualitative, based only on a dozen of books, focusing mainly on the high-level content of the books, such as the personalities of protagonists, antagonists, the nature of plots (e.g., Harvey (1953), Yun (2011)). In contrast, our work examines a considerably larger collection of books (800 in total) over eight different sub-genres, providing insights into lexical, syntactic, and discourse patterns that characterize the writing styles commonly shared among the successful literature. Another relevant work has been on a different domain of movies (Yun, 2011), however, the prediction is based only on external, non-textual information such as the reputation of actors and directors, and the power of distribution systems etc, without analyzing the actual content of the movie scripts.

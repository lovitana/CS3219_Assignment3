Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999123">
Recognizing bridging anaphora is difficult due
to the wide variation within the phenomenon,
the resulting lack of easily identifiable surface
markers and their relative rarity. We develop
linguistically motivated discourse structure,
lexico-semantic and genericity detection fea-
tures and integrate these into a cascaded mi-
nority preference algorithm that models bridg-
ing recognition as a subtask of learning fine-
grained information status (IS). We substan-
tially improve bridging recognition without
impairing performance on other IS classes.

In bridging or associative anaphora (Clark, 1975;
Prince, 1981; Gundel et al., 1993), the antecedent
and anaphor are not coreferent but are linked via a
variety of contiguity relations.1 In Example 1, the
phrases a resident, the stairs and the lobby are bridg-
ing anaphors with the antecedent One building.2
(1) One building was upgraded to red status while peo-
ple were taking things out, and a resident called up the
stairs to his girlfriend, telling her to keep sending things
down to the lobby.
Bridging is an important problem as it affects lin-
guistic theory and applications alike. For exam-
ple, without bridging resolution, entity coherence
between the first and second coordinated clause in

Example 1 cannot be established. This is a prob-
lem both for coherence theories such as Centering
(Grosz et al., 1995) (where bridging is therefore in-
corporated as an indirect realization of previous en-
tities) as well as applications relying on entity co-
herence modelling, such as readability assessment
or sentence ordering (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008).
Full bridging resolution needs (i) recognition that
a bridging anaphor is present and (ii) identification
of the antecedent and contiguity relation. In re-
cent work, these two tasks have been tackled sep-
arately, with bridging recognition handled as part of
information status (IS) classification (Markert et al.,
2012; Cahill and Riester, 2012; Rahman and Ng,
2012). Each mention in a text gets assigned one IS
class that describes its accessibility to the reader at
a given point in a text, bridging being one possible
class. We stay within this framework.
Bridging recognition is a difficult task, so that we
had to report very low results on this IS class in pre-
vious work (Markert et al., 2012). This is due to the
phenomenon’s variety, leading to a lack of clear sur-
face features for recognition. Instead, we formulate
in this paper novel discourse structure and lexico-
semantic features as well as features that distinguish
bridging from generics (see Section 3). In addition,
making up between 5% and 20% of definite descrip-
tions (Gardent and Manu´elian, 2005; Caselli and
Prodanof, 2006) and around 6% of all NPs (Mark-
ert et al., 2012), bridging is still less frequent than
many other IS classes and recognition of minority
classes is well known to be more difficult. We there-
fore use a cascaded classification algorithm to ad-
dress this problem (Omuya et al., 2013).

Most bridging research concentrates on antecedent
selection only (Poesio and Vieira, 1998; Poesio et
al., 2004a; Markert et al., 2003; Lassalle and De-
nis, 2011; Hou et al., 2013), assuming that bridg-
ing recognition has already been performed. Previ-
ous work on recognition is either limited to definite
NPs based on heuristics evaluated on small datasets
(Hahn et al., 1996; Vieira and Poesio, 2000), or
models it as a subtask of learning fine-grained IS
(Rahman and Ng, 2012; Markert et al., 2012; Cahill
and Riester, 2012). Results within this latter frame-
work for bridging have been mixed: We reported in
Markert et al. (2012) low results for bridging in writ-
ten news text whereas Rahman and Ng (2012) re-
port high results for the four subcategories of bridg-
ing annotated in the Switchboard dialogue corpus by
Nissim et al. (2004). We believe this discrepancy to
be due to differences in corpus size and genre as well
as in bridging definition. Bridging in Switchboard
includes non-anaphoric, syntactically linked part-of
and set-member relationships (such as the building’s
lobby), as well as comparative anaphora, the latter
being marked by surface indicators such as other,
another etc. Both types are much easier to identify
than anaphoric bridging cases.3 In addition, many
non-anaphoric lexical cohesion cases have been an-
notated as bridging in Switchbard as well.
We also separate bridging recognition and ante-
cedent selection. One could argue that a joint model
is more attractive as potential antecedents such as
building “trigger” subsequent bridging cases such as
stairs (Example 1). However, bridging can be indi-
cated by referential patterns without world knowl-
edge about the anaphor/antecedent NPs, as the non-
sense example 2 shows: the wug is clearly a bridging
anaphor although we do not know the antecedent.4
(2) The blicket couldn’t be connected to the dax. The
wug failed.
Similarly, Clark (1975) distinguishes between
bridging via necessary, probable and inducible
parts/roles and argues that only in the first and
maybe the second case the antecedent triggers the

bridging anaphor in the sense that we already spon-
taneously think of the anaphor when we read the an-
tecedent. Also, bridging recognition on its own can
be valuable for applications: for example, prosody is
influenced by IS status without needing antecedent
knowledge (Baumann and Riester, 2013).

Bridging anaphors are rarely marked by surface fea-
tures. Indeed, even the common practice (Vieira and
Poesio, 2000; Lassalle and Denis, 2011; Cahill and
Riester, 2012) to limit bridging to definite NPs does
not seem to be correct: We report in previous work
(Hou et al., 2013) that less than 40% of the bridg-
ing anaphora in our corpus are definites. Instead,
bridging is diverse with regard to syntactic form
and function: bridging anaphora can be definite NPs
(Examples 4 and 6), indefinite NPs (Example 5) or
bare NPs (Examples 3, 8 and 9). The only frequent
syntactic property shared is that bridging NPs tend
to have a simple internal structure with regards to
modification. Bridging is also easily confused with
generics: friends is used as bridging anaphor in Ex-
ample 9 but generically in Example 10.

and/or lexical or world knowledge. With regard to
discourse structure, Grosz et al. (1995) observe that
bridging is often needed to establish entity coher-
ence between two adjacent sentences (Examples 1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9). With regard to lexical and world
knowledge, relational noun phrases (Examples 3, 4,
8 and 9), building parts (Example 1), set member-
ship elements (Example 7), or, more rarely, tem-
poral/spatial modification (Example 6) may favor a
bridging reading. Motivated by these observations,
we develop discourse structure and lexico-semantic
features indicating bridging anaphora as well as fea-
tures designed to separate genericity from bridging.

3.2 Features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9957708">
In Markert et al. (2012) we classify eight fine-
grained IS categories for NPs in written text: old,
new and 6 mediated categories (syntactic, world-
Knowledge, bridging, comparative, aggregate and
function). This feature set (Table 1, f1-f13) works
well to identify old, new and several mediated cate-
gories. However, it fails to recognize most bridging
anaphora which we try to remedy in this work by
including more diverse features.
Discourse structure features (Table 2, f1-f3).
Bridging occurs frequently in sentences where oth-
erwise there would no entity coherence to previous
sentences/clauses (see Grosz et al. (1995) and Poe-
sio et al. (2004b) for discussions about bridging, en-
tity coherence and centering transitions in the Cen-
tering framework). This is especially true for topic
NPs (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) in such sentences.
We follow these insights by identifying coherence
gap sentences (see Examples 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and also
2): a sentence has a coherence gap (f1) if it has none

of the following three coherence elements: (1) entity
coreference to previous sentences, as approximated
via string match or presence of pronouns, (2) com-
parative anaphora approximated by mentions modi-
fied via a small set of comparative markers (see also
Table 1, f10 PreModByCompMarker), or (3) proper
names. We approximate the topic of a sentence via
the first mention (f2).
f3 models that bridging anaphors do not appear
at the beginning of a text.
Semantic features (Table 2, f4-f10). In contrast
to generic patterns, our semantic features capture
lexical properties of nouns that make them more
likely to be the head of a bridging NP. We create
f4-f8 to capture four kinds of bridging anaphora.
L¨obner (1985) distinguishes between relational
nouns that take on at least one obligatory semantic
role (such as friend) and sortal nouns. It is likely that
relational nouns are more frequently used as bridg-
ing than sortal nouns (see Examples 3, 4, 8 and 9).
We extract a list containing around 4,000 relational
nouns from WordNet and a list containing around
500 nouns that specify professional roles from the
General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966), then
determine whether the NP head appears in these lists
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.9996148">
or not (f4 and f5). The obligatory semantic role for
a relational noun can of course also be filled NP in-
ternally instead of anaphorically and we use the fea-
tures f10 (for instances such as the Egyptian presi-
dent) and f18 (for complex NPs that are likely to fill
needed roles NP internally) to address this.
Because part-of relations are typical bridging re-
lations (see Example 1 and Clark (1975)), we use f6
to determine whether the NP is a part of the building
or not, using again a list extracted from Inquirer.
f7 is used to identify set membership bridging
cases (see Example 7), by checking whether the
NP head is a number or indefinite pronoun (such as
none, one, some) or modified by each, one. How-
ever, not all numbers are bridging cases (such as
1976) and we use f9 to exclude such cases.
Lassalle and Denis (2011) note that some bridging
anaphors are indicated by spatial or temporal modi-
fications (see Example 6). We use f8 to detect this
by compiling 20 such adjectives from Inquirer.
Features to detect generic nouns (Table 2, f11-
f15). Generic NPs (Example 10) are easily con-
fused with bridging anaphora. Inspired by Reiter
and Frank (2010) who build on linguistic research,
we develop features (f11-f15) to exclude generics.
First, hypothetical entities are likely to refer to
generic entities (Mitchell et al., 2002), We approx-
imate this by determining whether the NP appears
in an if-clause (f11). Also the clause tense and
mood may play a role to decide genericity (Reiter
and Frank, 2010). This is often reflected by the main
verb of a clause, so we extract its POS tag (f12).
Some NPs are commonly used generically, such
as children, men, or the dollar. The ACE-2 corpus
(distinct from our corpus) contains generic annota-
tion . We collect all NPs from ACE-2 that are always
used generically (f13). We also try to learn NPs that
are uniquely identifiable without further description
or anaphoric links such as the sun or the pope. We
do this by extracting common nouns which are an-
notated as worldKnowledge from the training part of
our corpus5 and use these as lexical features (f14).
Finally, motivated by the ACE-2 annotation
guidelines, we identify six quantifiers that may in-
dicate genericity, such as all, no, neither (f15).

cross validation.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.994912857142857">
Other features for bridging (Table 2, f16-f18).
Following Rahman and Ng (2012), we use unigrams
(f16). We also extract heads of bridging anaphors
from the training data as lexical features (f17) to
learn typical nouns used for bridging that we did not
cover in lexicon extraction (f4 to f6).
Feature f18 models that bridging anaphora most
often have a simple internal structure and usually do
not contain any other NPs.
Features for other IS categories (Table 2, f19-
f21). We propose three features to improve other
IS categories. In the relational feature f19, we sep-
arate coordination parent-child from other parent-
child relations to help with the class aggregate. f20
determines whether a number is the object of an in-
crease/decrease verb (using a list extracted from In-
quirer) and therefore likely to be the IS class func-
tion. Frequent proper names are more likely to be
hearer old and hence of the class worldKnowledge.
f21 extracts proper names that occur in at least 100
documents in the Tipster corpus to approximate this.

classes (including bridging) with low precision if the
features are not strong enough. Our novel features
(addressing linguistic properties of bridging) and the
cascaded algorithm (addressing data sparseness) ap-
pear to be complementary.
To look at the impact of features in our best sys-
tem, we performed an ablation study. Lexical fea-
tures as well as semantic ones have the most impact.
Discourse structure and genericity information fea-
tures have less of an impact. We believe the latter to
be due to noise involved in extracting these features
(such as approximating coreference for the coher-
ence gap feature) as well as genericity recognition
still being in its infancy (Reiter and Frank, 2010).

This paper aims to recognize bridging anaphora in
written text. We develop discourse structure, lexico-
semantic and genericity features based on linguis-

our approach outperforms the bridging recognition
in Markert et al. (2012) by a large margin without
impairing the performance on other IS classes.

This is due to the phenomenon’s variety, leading to a lack of clear surface features for recognition. Instead, we formulate in this paper novel discourse structure and lexicosemantic features as well as features that distinguish bridging from generics (see Section 3). In addition, making up between 5% and 20% of definite descriptions (Gardent and Manu´elian, 2005; Caselli and Prodanof, 2006) and around 6% of all NPs (Markert et al., 2012), bridging is still less frequent than many other IS classes and recognition of minority classes is well known to be more difficult.

We also separate bridging recognition and antecedent selection. One could argue that a joint model is more attractive as potential antecedents such as building “trigger” subsequent bridging cases such as stairs (Example 1). However, bridging can be indicated by referential patterns without world knowledge about the anaphor/antecedent NPs, as the nonsense example 2 shows: the wug is clearly a bridging anaphor although we do not know the antecedent.4 (2) The blicket couldn’t be connected to the dax. The wug failed. Similarly, Clark (1975) distinguishes between bridging via necessary, probable and inducible parts/roles and argues that only in the first and maybe the second case the antecedent triggers the 3See also the high results for our specific category for comparative anaphora (Markert et al., 2012). 4We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out. bridging anaphor in the sense that we already spontaneously think of the anaphor when we read the antecedent.

The obligatory semantic role for a relational noun can of course also be filled NP internally instead of anaphorically and we use the features f10 (for instances such as the Egyptian president) and f18 (for complex NPs that are likely to fill needed roles NP internally) to address this. Because part-of relations are typical bridging relations (see Example 1 and Clark (1975)), we use f6 to determine whether the NP is a part of the building or not, using again a list extracted from Inquirer. f7 is used to identify set membership bridging cases (see Example 7), by checking whether the NP head is a number or indefinite pronoun (such as none, one, some) or modified by each, one. However, not all numbers are bridging cases (such as 1976) and we use f9 to exclude such cases. Lassalle and Denis (2011) note that some bridging anaphors are indicated by spatial or temporal modifications (see Example 6).

Full bridging resolution needs (i) recognition that a bridging anaphor is present and (ii) identification of the antecedent and contiguity relation. In recent work, these two tasks have been tackled separately, with bridging recognition handled as part of information status (IS) classification (Markert et al., 2012; Cahill and Riester, 2012; Rahman and Ng, 2012). Each mention in a text gets assigned one IS class that describes its accessibility to the reader at a given point in a text, bridging being one possible class. We stay within this framework. Bridging recognition is a difficult task, so that we had to report very low results on this IS class in previous work (Markert et al., 2012). This is due to the phenomenon’s variety, leading to a lack of clear surface features for recognition. Instead, we formulate in this paper novel discourse structure and lexicosemantic features as well as features that </context>

We develop linguistically motivated discourse structure, lexico-semantic and genericity detection features and integrate these into a cascaded minority preference algorithm that models bridging recognition as a subtask of learning finegrained information status (IS). We substantially improve bridging recognition without impairing performance on other IS classes. 1 Introduction In bridging or associative anaphora (Clark, 1975; Prince, 1981; Gundel et al., 1993), the antecedent and anaphor are not coreferent but are linked via a variety of contiguity relations.1 In Example 1, the phrases a resident, the stairs and the lobby are bridging anaphors with the antecedent One building.2 (1) One building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out, and a resident called up the stairs to his girlfriend, telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby. Bridging is an important problem as it affects linguistic theory and applications alike. For example, without bridging resolution, entity coherence between the first</context>

Full bridging resolution needs (i) recognition that a bridging anaphor is present and (ii) identification of the antecedent and contiguity relation. In recent work, these two tasks have been tackled separately, with bridging recognition handled as part of information status (IS) classification (Markert et al., 2012; Cahill and Riester, 2012; Rahman and Ng, 2012). Each mention in a text gets assigned one IS class that describes its accessibility to the reader at a given point in a text, bridging being one possible class. We stay within this framework. Bridging recognition is a difficult task, so that we had to report very low results on this IS class in previous work (Markert et al., 2012). This is due to the phenomenon’s variety, leading to a lack of clear surface features for recognition. Instead, we formulate in this paper novel discourse structure and lexicosemantic features as well as features that distinguish bridging from generics (see Section </context>

Results within this latter framework for bridging have been mixed: We reported in Markert et al. (2012) low results for bridging in written news text whereas Rahman and Ng (2012) report high results for the four subcategories of bridging annotated in the Switchboard dialogue corpus by Nissim et al. (2004). We believe this discrepancy to be due to differences in corpus size and genre as well as in bridging definition.

We also try to learn NPs that are uniquely identifiable without further description or anaphoric links such as the sun or the pope. We do this by extracting common nouns which are annotated as worldKnowledge from the training part of our corpus5 and use these as lexical features (f14). Finally, motivated by the ACE-2 annotation guidelines, we identify six quantifiers that may indicate genericity, such as all, no, neither (f15). 5This list varies for each run of our algorithm in 10-fold cross validation. Other features for bridging (Table 2, f16-f18). Following Rahman and Ng (2012), we use unigrams (f16). We also extract heads of bridging anaphors from the training data as lexical features (f17) to learn typical nouns used for bridging that we did not cover in lexicon extraction (f4 to f6). Feature f18 models that bridging anaphora most often have a simple internal structure and usually do not contain any other NPs. Features for other IS categories (Table 2, f19- f21).

However, not all numbers are bridging cases (such as 1976) and we use f9 to exclude such cases. Lassalle and Denis (2011) note that some bridging anaphors are indicated by spatial or temporal modifications (see Example 6). We use f8 to detect this by compiling 20 such adjectives from Inquirer. Features to detect generic nouns (Table 2, f11- f15). Generic NPs (Example 10) are easily confused with bridging anaphora. Inspired by Reiter and Frank (2010) who build on linguistic research, we develop features (f11-f15) to exclude generics. First, hypothetical entities are likely to refer to generic entities (Mitchell et al., 2002), We approximate this by determining whether the NP appears in an if-clause (f11). Also the clause tense and mood may play a role to decide genericity (Reiter and Frank, 2010). This is often reflected by the main verb of a clause, so we extract its POS tag (f12). Some NPs are commonly used generically, such as children, men, or the dollar. The ACE-2 corpus (distinct from our corpus) contains generic annotation . We col</context>

Our novel features (addressing linguistic properties of bridging) and the cascaded algorithm (addressing data sparseness) appear to be complementary. To look at the impact of features in our best system, we performed an ablation study. Lexical features as well as semantic ones have the most impact. Discourse structure and genericity information features have less of an impact. We believe the latter to be due to noise involved in extracting these features (such as approximating coreference for the coherence gap feature) as well as genericity recognition still being in its infancy (Reiter and Frank, 2010). 5 Conclusions This paper aims to recognize bridging anaphora in written text. We develop discourse structure, lexicosemantic and genericity features based on linguistic intuition and corpus research. By using a cascading minority preference system, we show that our approach outperforms the bridging recognition in Markert et al. (2012) by a large margin without impairing the performance on other IS classes. Acknowledgements.

We create f4-f8 to capture four kinds of bridging anaphora. L¨obner (1985) distinguishes between relational nouns that take on at least one obligatory semantic role (such as friend) and sortal nouns. It is likely that relational nouns are more frequently used as bridging than sortal nouns (see Examples 3, 4, 8 and 9). We extract a list containing around 4,000 relational nouns from WordNet and a list containing around 500 nouns that specify professional roles from the General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966), then determine whether the NP head appears in these lists 816 or not (f4 and f5). The obligatory semantic role for a relational noun can of course also be filled NP internally instead of anaphorically and we use the features f10 (for instances such as the Egyptian president) and f18 (for complex NPs that are likely to fill needed roles NP internally) to address this. Because part-of relations are typical bridging relations (see Example 1 and Clark (1975)), we use f6 to determine whether the NP is a part of the building or not, using again a list extracted from Inquirer. f7 is used to identif</context>

Also, bridging recognition on its own can be valuable for applications: for example, prosody is influenced by IS status without needing antecedent knowledge (Baumann and Riester, 2013). 3 Characterizing Bridging Anaphora for Automatic Recognition 3.1 Properties of bridging anaphora Bridging anaphors are rarely marked by surface features. Indeed, even the common practice (Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Lassalle and Denis, 2011; Cahill and Riester, 2012) to limit bridging to definite NPs does not seem to be correct: We report in previous work (Hou et al., 2013) that less than 40% of the bridging anaphora in our corpus are definites. Instead, bridging is diverse with regard to syntactic form and function: bridging anaphora can be definite NPs (Examples 4 and 6), indefinite NPs (Example 5) or bare NPs (Examples 3, 8 and 9). The only frequent syntactic property shared is that bridging NPs tend to have a simple internal structure with regards to modification. Bridging is also easily confused wi</context>

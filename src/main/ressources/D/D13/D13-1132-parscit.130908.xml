Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999310421052632">
Hot trends are likely to bring new business
opportunities. For example, “Air Pollution”
might lead to a significant increase of the sales
of related products, e.g., mouth mask. For e-
commerce companies, it is very important to
make rapid and correct response to these hot
trends in order to improve product sales. In
this paper, we take the initiative to study the
task of how to identify trend related products.
The major novelty of our work is that we au-
tomatically learn commercial intents revealed
from microblogs. We carefully construct a da-
ta collection for this task and present quite a
few insightful findings. In order to solve this
problem, we further propose a graph based
method, which jointly models relevance and
associativity. We perform extensive experi-
ments and the results showed that our methods
are very effective.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999246">
A trend is a hot topic (e.g., the release of a popular
movie) which is being widely discussed by the pub-
lic. Hot trends usually attract much attention from
the public, and they are likely to bring new business
opportunities. Consider the following e-shopping s-
cenario. A user in Beijing would like to buy some-
thing to reduce the health impacts of Beijing air pol-
lution1. Different from traditional e-shopping sto-
ries, in this case the user may not have a clear idea of
what she should buy, and cannot even formulate the

purchase needs into a clear query. Faced with trend-
driven business opportunities, e-commerce compa-
nies typically ask workers to manually identify relat-
ed products and make heuristic rules to match user
queries (e.g., incorporating trending keywords into
related product titles).
To improve trend-driven e-commerce, in this pa-
per, we propose to study the novel task of automat-
ically identifying trend related products. Why is
it compelling to understand and study trend-driven
product purchase? Because hot trends are closely
related to business opportunities directly or indirect-
ly. As a case of direct causal relationship, the world-
wide popularity of the movie series “Harry Potter”
created the great success of the original novels of
“Harry Potter”. As a case of indirect causal rela-
tionship, the stock rise or salary increase might exert
positive effects on product sale. Based on our empir-
ical analysis (See Section 3), a considerable propor-
tion, i.e. 50%, of hot trends discussed on the largest
Chinese microblog (i.e. Sina Weibo) indeed have
corresponding product entries in the largest Chinese
C2C e-commerce website (i.e. Taobao), which in-
dicates a strong correlation between hot trends and
product sale.
Although the task is important and emergent, it
has at least two major challenges. First of all, how to
infer users’ trend-driven purchase intents promptly.
A trend usually happens unexpectedly. Without pri-
or knowledge and experiences, it is particularly diffi-
cult to make rapid response to relate the trend to can-
didate products. Our solution is to leverage trend-
related commercial intents from microblogs by min-
ing users’ real-time response to a trending topic. We
adopt the solution based on two key considerations:
(1) Microblogs are fast. As previous studies showed,

<bodyText confidence="0.99900385483871">
the first story of a trending topic indeed was usu-
ally reported in microblogs rather than traditional
news media (Sakaki et al., 2010; Kwak et al., 2010;
Leskovec et al., 2009). (2) Microblogs contain user-
s’ commercial intents. The microblogging service
has become one of the most popular social network
platforms, where users may tweet about their needs
and desires (Hollerit et al., 2013). E.g., a microblog
user may complain about the air quality and evince
the desire to buy a mouth mask in a tweet. The ex-
ample indicates we can make use of tweet-level re-
latedness to capture the correlation between trends
and products.
Second, how to achieve a comprehensive cover-
age of related products but not hurting precision.
The above solution will miss the related products
which have not been discussed in microblogs. Our
idea is to take the associativity between products in-
to consideration. Our definition about associativity
is very general and can have different instantiation-
s in specific settings. For example, we can define
product associativity to be the similarity between
product descriptions, or the ratio of historical pur-
chase records in e-commerce companies. Howev-
er, one-step associativity may not fully discover the
underlying relatedness between products due to the
fact that the product associativity is indeed transi-
tive. Thus, a transitable associativity model is need-
ed.
To address these two challenges, we propose a u-
nified graph based ranking algorithm which jointly
models the above two aspects, i.e., relevance and
associativity. Given a trend, the algorithm runs in
an iterative way and seeks a trade-off between rel-
evance and associativity by propagating the scores
on the product graph. Our contribution can be sum-
marized as follows: (1) we introduce the novel task
of identifying trend related products, most of all, we
propose to leverage trend-related commercial intents
from microblogs; (2) we present insightful empiri-
cal analysis to illustrate the correlation between hot
trends and product sale (See Section 3); (3) we pro-
pose a novel graph based ranking algorithm which
jointly considers relevance and associativity; (4) we
carefully construct the test collection based on re-
al data of the largest microblog and the largest C2C
e-commerce website in China. (5) we perform ex-
tensive experiments and present some important im-
plications for practice.
To the best of our knowledge, our work was the
first to consider identifying trend related products by
leveraging commercial intents from microblogs. We
believe the current work will have important impact
on industry and inspire more follow-up research s-
tudies. The rest of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. We present the data collection and empiri-
cal analysis of the impact of hot trends on product
sale in Section 3. We present a novel graph-based
method in Section 4. Experimental setup and result-
s are discussed in Section 5 and Section 6. Finally,
the related work is discussed in Section 7. And the
conclusions and future work are given in Section 8.

2 Problem Definition
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999213181818182">
A trend is a hot topic widely discussed by the public,
e.g., the release of a hot movie. Usually, a trend e
can be described by a small set of keywords denoted
by Ke and a corresponding time span T.
Trend-related Products Identification: Given a
trend e, we assume that the following inputs are
available: 1) tweets that contain trend keywords Ke
and 2) a product database which provides a set of
candidate products P = {p1, p2, ..., pnI with nec-
essary detailed information, e.g., titles and descrip-
tions. The objective of trend-related products iden-
tification is to identify products in P that are related
to trend e within the time span T, denoted by PR.
For convenience, we will not explicitly mention the
time span unless needed.
To better understand the problem, we first present
an illustrative example in Table 1, which will be dis-
cussed as the running case throughout the paper. In
this example, we can see that a few users tweet their
product needs related to the trend “Air Pollution”.
We take Taobao as the product database and present
a few related products in it.

3 Data and Observations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975552">
As discussed earlier, hot trends may exert positive
effects on the sale of related products. In this sec-
tion, we will construct a deep analysis on this point
by presenting quantitative answers to the following
two problems:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9986226">
• Q1: What is the proportion of hot trends that
potentially lead to business opportunities, and
how is their impact on related products?
• Q2: How is the associativity between related
products?

<bodyText confidence="0.903924">
These findings are key and fundamental to develop
our models.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998631">
3.1 Data Collection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984">
To perform the above analysis, the key is how to con-
struct an experimental data collection which relates
hot trends to corresponding related products. We
jointly consider microblogs and e-commerce plat-
forms: we obtain hot trends in microblogs and man-
ually identify trend-related products in e-commerce
websites. In this paper, we adopt Sina Weibo3
as the microbloging platform and Taobao4 as the
e-commerce platform, which are the biggest mi-
croblogging service and the largest C2C company in
China respectively. The analysis method is general
and can equally apply to other platforms. For both t-
wo data signals, we consider a two-month time span,
i.e. from May 2013 to June 2013.
Trend detection. Since trend detection is not our
focus, we directly obtained trends from “trending
topics” provided by the microblog platform. Our
work can be easily extended to incorporate a trend
detection component. Similar to “trending topic-
s” in Twitter, Sina Weibo provides a public list of
top searched keywords which can be obtained by
the Weibo search API5. In the list, top 50 keyword-
s are presented and ordered by the number of be-
ing searched. Weibo classifies these keywords in-
to five categories: China, movie, business, person
and sports. We consider these keywords to be trend
keywords. These keywords are dynamically updated
and we monitor the trend lists in the considered time

span. We define the start and end time of a trend to
be the first day and the last day on the trend list re-
spectively, which spans the active interval of a trend.
We only keep the trend which has an active interval
with more than one day. For each trend, we use the
trend keywords to retrieve all related tweets in the
active interval, and use the pattern based method in
(Hollerit et al., 2013) to extract all mentioned prod-
uct keywords. We present a few example patterns
used for extracting product keywords in Table 2. Af-
ter that we can obtain a set of product keywords for
each trend.

Related product identification and annotation.
For each trend, we have the product keyword set to-
gether with the trend keywords as described above.
We use these keywords to retrieve candidate prod-
ucts in the product search engine of Taobao with-
in the active interval of the trend. For each can-
didate product, we further crawl its product page
and obtain corresponding related products suggest-
ed by Taobao, which are treated as candidate, too.
We invite two senior post-graduate students major
in economics as human judges. The judge is re-
quired to make a binary decision whether a product
is related to a trend by following a detailed guide-
line compiled by a senior officer of an e-commerce
company in Beijing. For each trend, we provide the
trend keywords, product keywords in tweets, relat-
ed tweets, related news articles from China Daily6.
Web access is available during the annotation pro-
cess. Due to space limit, we do not present the an-
notation guideline here. We use Cohen’s kappa to
measure the agreement of these two judges, which
has a high value of 0.75. To speed up the work,
we further group all products which have the same
lowest categorial label (e.g., leaf label) 7, and we

will treat a group as a product in later experiments.
We only keep the products with the same judgments
and the trends with at least one related product. We
present the statistics of data set in Table 3 8. Since
current e-commerce search engines mainly adop-
t keyword matching based retrieval method, we fur-
ther examine the performance of simply using trend
keywords as queries. We compute the percentage
of related/unrelated products with at least one trend
keyword in their description. We can see that on-
ly 29.7% related products can be found on average.
These statistics indicate that more effective methods
are needed for the current task.

3.2 Observations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949041666667">
Now we analyze the data collection and present our
observations.
A1: First of all, it is important to find out the pro-
portion of hot trends that potentially leads to busi-
ness opportunities. Recall that each trend has a cat-
egory label and possibly a set of related products i-
dentified by the judges. We refer to a trend with
related products as a business-related trend. We
present the statistics in Fig. 1. We can see that
about 36% of all trends have corresponding relat-
ed products in Taobao, which indicates that these
trends highly relate to business. Movies and Sport-
s have higher proportions of business-related trend-
s, i.e. 81% and 52% respectively, while the other
categories have lower proportions but still with a
substantial number of business related trends. It is
noteworthy that Business has the lowest proportion,
the major reason is that trends in Business are usual-
ly general events, i.e., the release of new economic
policy, which do not directly correspond to related
products. As we discussed earlier, these trends may
have indirect impact on product sales. Currently,
we only focus on direct impact, and indirect impacts
will be considered in future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.953306266666667">
Next we continue to examine the impact of hot
trends on the sale of related products. We obtain
product sales from Taobao product pages. As we can
see in Fig. 2, the average sale of related products in
all categories gradually increased with trends going
on. Interestingly, we can see that categories Movies
and China achieved very significant increase. Prod-
ucts related to Movies trends are usually related to
the movie itself, e.g., movie tickets; while prod-
ucts related to China tend to be commodities (e.g.,
the mouth masks for the trend of “Air Pollution”)
or trending products (e.g., Shenzhou-10 Spacecraft
Model for the trend of “the launch of Shenzhou-
10”).

A2: Recall we have discussed that product asso-
ciativity is useful for improving the coverage of re-
lated products. Here we would like to quantitatively
examine the associativity between related products
given a trend. For a trend, we first compute the av-
erage pairwise similarity between related products
in terms of their descriptive texts (e.g. title and de-
scription). Since there are more unrelated products,
we randomly sample an equal number of unrelated
products from the candidate products we previously
generated. Then we compute the average similarity
between a related product and an unrelated product.
We further average these values over all the trends
of each category. The average similarity of related-
related product pairs is 0.112, while the average sim-
ilarities of unrelated-unrelated and related-unrelated

product keywords directly reveal users’ commercial
intents on the trends. Instead of modeling person-
alized intents, we consider learning a unified trend-
driven intent by representing the intent as a weighted
vector over these product keywords. And the key is
how to set the keyword weight.
Keyword weighting. A good weighting method
should be able to leverage commercial interest-
s/intents of users well and emphasize the keyword-
s users really focus on. Thus we consider making
use of the retweeting (a.k.a. forwarding) mechanis-
m in microblogs. Retweet links are shown to be bet-
ter in revealing relevance and interests (Welch et al.,
2011). Formally, we use the following weighting
formula for a keyword k:

product pairs are 0.039 and 0.058 respectively.9
In summary, A1 indicates that a large proportion
of hot trends are potentially related to products and
will exert positive effects on product sale; A2 in-
dicates that there is a strong associativity between
related products, which can be utilized to improve
both precision and recall of the algorithm.

4 The Proposed Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972">
In this section, we present a graph based ranking al-
gorithm jointly models the relevance of a product
and the associativity between products. Recall that
we have collected a set of product keywords and a
set of candidate products for each trend. Our aim is
to re-rank these candidate products to obtain a better
ranking of related products. We adopt a biased ran-
dom walk algorithm: 1) relevance is modeled as bi-
ased restart probability and 2) associativity is mod-
eled through random walk on the product graph.

lated to a trend. However, to stimulate the real sce-
nario that we want to identify the related products at
the beginning of a trend, we only keep the keyword-
s which were contained in tweets published in the
first three days when a trend began. These extracted

(i.e., not a retweet) that contain the keyword k in
the considered time span, and #rtt is the retweet

called as intent vector. We denote the intent vector

we discuss about how to define the product rele-
vance. Given a product p, we extract all the words in

To start this part, we first present an illustrative ex-
ample in Fig. 3. We can see there are four relat-
ed products for the trend “Air Pollution”. We as-
sume that only “mouth mask” was mentioned in mi-
croblogs. Now we expect to mine more related prod-
ucts with “mouth mask” as a known related produc-
t. We can compute the similarity between a pair of
products. Intuitively, if the similarity between a can-
didate product and “mouth mask” is higher than a
predefined threshold, we can consider it to be relat-
ed, too. In this example, “air detector” and “air pu-
rifier” are similar to “mouth mask” in terms of prod-

Thus, we propose to use the random walk method
to propagate the relatedness score on the produc-
t graph. Let P denote the number of all the can-
didate products, and rP,1 denote the relatedness s-
core vector where ri denote the relatedness score of
product pi.
We first construct the product graph. We repre-
sent each candidate product as a vertex in the graph
and built the link with the cosine similarity between
the descriptive texts of two products as the link

and Mij denotes the similarity between products pi
and pp Formally, we formulate the problem in a s-

see that relatedness score can be propagated on the

4.3 Jointly Modeling Relevance and
Associativity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999852">
Having discussed about how to model both rele-
vance and associativity, now we are ready to present
a joint model to capture these two factors. By fol-
lowing (Zhao et al., 2013), the main idea is that in-
stead of using a uniform restart distribution y, we
use an relevance biased restart distribution in E-
q. 2. We set the restart probability of a produc-
t to its corresponding relevance. Formally, we set
yi = rel(e,pi). Let us further explain the idea. At
the beginning of each iteration, each product is first
assigned to its relevance score: the more relevant it
is, the larger score it has. During the iteration, each
product begins to collect relevance evidence from its
neighbors on the product graph: the more relevan-
t neighbors it has, the larger score it obtains. And
the final score is indeed a trade-off between its own
relevance score and neighboring relevance scores it
receives. In order to obtain an ergodic walk, we add
a small value, i.e. 1e − 4, to each entry of y and
then normalize this vector. We denote our algorithm
as JMRA (Jointly Modeling Relevance and Associa-
tivity).
To have an intuitive understanding of our algo-
rithm, let us turn to the example in Fig. 3 again. At
the beginning, only “mouth mask” has a large rele-
vance score, with the iteration going on, the related-
ness score will be propagated between products on
the graph. Although “green plants” has not a direct
link with “mouth mask”, it can obtain relatedness s-
core from its neighbors, i.e. “air detector” and “air
purifier”. JMRA is able to discover such latent asso-
ciativity between products.

For a real product search engine, top results are par-

precision@10 as the evaluation metrics. Similar to
Information Retrieval, we also consider using Mean
Average Precision (MAP) as metrics to measure the
overall quality of retrieved products.

5.2 Methods to Compare

<bodyText confidence="0.997548526315789">
We compare the following methods for inferring re-
lating products:
SALES: we rank the candidate products by their
historical sales volume descendingly.
TREND: we use trend keywords as queries and rank
the products by their relevance.
TREND+fb: based on TREND, we further incorpo-
rate pseudo-relevance feedback (Salton, 1971;
Salton and Buckley, 1997). After some tun-
ing (See Section 6.5), top 3 search results were
used to update the query.
JMRAr: it is our method which only considers
product relevance in Section 4.1.
JMRAr + fb: we further apply pseudo-relevance
feedback to JMRAr.
JMRAr+a: it is our method which considers both
relevance and associativity in Section 4.3.
JMRAr+a + fb: we further apply pseudo-relevance
feedback to JMRAr+a.

6 Experimental Results and Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950875">
In this section, we first evaluate the performance of
the proposed approach and the comparison method-
s. Next, we analyze a problem in real e-commerce
search engines, i.e., the cold start. Then, we give
a qualitative case study to further demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally,
we examine the parameter sensitivity to the perfor-
mance.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999839">
6.1 Comparison of Performance
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999582525">
We present the results of various methods in Table
4. We first examine the performance of baselines
SALES, TREND and TREND+fb. First, SALES has
the worst performance due to the fact that a trend
usually happen unexpectedly and historical records
may not predict it well. The second observation is
that the improvement of TREND+fb over TREND is
little. This is mainly because that very few related
products can be identified only based on trend key-
words so feedback method does not work very well
on it.
Then we compare our relevance based method-
s with the above three baselines. Note that the
major difference between JMRAr and TREND is
that JMRAr makes uses of both trend keywords
and product keywords extracted from microblogs.
We can see that JMRAr performs better than al-
l three baselines. It proves the effectiveness of lever-
aging commercial intents from microblogs. An-
other interesting point is that the relative improve-
ment JMRAr+fb over JMRAr is larger than that
TREND+fb over TREND. The reason is that pseudo
relevance feedback relies highly on top results and a
system with better search quality will benefit more
from it.
Finally, we consider evaluating our full models
which jointly consider relevance and associativity. It
is easy to see JMRAr+a yields a significant improve-
ment over JMRAr and even outperforms JMRAr+fb.
This observation supports our assumption that prod-
uct associativity is very important in this task. A-
gain, pseudo relevance feedback has also improved
JMRAr+a.
In summary, our results have shown some impor-
tant implications for trend-related product retrieval
on e-commerce search engines: 1) microblogs are
very good signals to learn users’ commercial intents;
2) product associativity is particularly important; 3)
other advanced retrieval methods are potentially use-
ful, e.g., pseudo relevance feedback.

6.2 Cold Start
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998058">
It is noteworthy that we have considered all the can-
didate products within the entire active interval of a
trend when constructing the test collection. This is
mainly to obtain a good coverage of related product-
s since some e-commerce companies might release
new products as the response to a trend. During the
active interval of a trend, the e-commerce companies
may make some heuristic rules to enhance the re-
trieval of related products, e.g., incorporating trend
keywords into product titles and descriptions. In the

<bodyText confidence="0.999942904761905">
real application scenario, an effective method is ex-
pected to identify related products at the beginning
of a trend when the e-commerce workers may not
make any response to the trend. How would it be
if we do not have the manually generated trend key-
words from workers in product titles and descrip-
tions?
To answer the question, in this part, we contin-
ue to examine the impact of cold start on different
methods. We select three methods as comparisons,
i.e., TREND+fb, JMRAr + fb and JMRAr+a + fb.
We first use keyword matching methods to obtain
all the products that related to trend keywords. The
descriptive text (i.e., title and description) of these
products has been refined to match trend queries by
sellers in e-commerce websites. We further removed
all the trend keywords in the desriptive text of these
products, and gradually add the trend keywords back
to original products. In such a process, we would
like to examine how cold start affects the perfor-
mance of different methods.

We present the results in Fig. 4. First, per-
formance of all these methods improve with the
increase of products with trend keywords. Sec-
ond, cold start does not affect the relative perfor-
mance order of different methods, i.e., TREND+fb
&lt; JMRAr + fb &lt; JMRAr+a + fb. Finally, all the
methods display similar impact patterns: “signifi-
cantli increasing” —* “stable”. An interesting ob-
servation is that JMRAr + fb and JMRAr+a + fb
have much more stable performance compared to
TREND+fb. It indicates that our methods are very
robust to the cold start, and potentially applicable in
real e-commerce search engines.

6.3 Case Study
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977941176471">
In order to have a intuitive understanding of how
different method perform, we present a case study
in this part. We select JMRAr, JMRAr+fb and
JMRAr+a+fb as comparisons. The results are shown
in Table 5. We can see that JMRAr+a+fb have iden-
tified the most related products. We further analyze
the contribution of different factors. Compared with
JMRAr, JMRAr+fb has got one more related prod-
uct “Houseplant” due to the reason pseudo feedback
can make use of top related search results to im-
prove the queries. In this case, “Houseplant” is i-
dentified to be related because it is very similar to
“Air Detector” (We have presented the correspond-
ing most associative products in brackets in Table 5).
Similarly, the comparison between JMRAr+fb and
JMRAr+a+fb shows the effectiveness of product as-
sociativity.

6.4 Error Analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999381">
To further understand the shortcomings of the pro-
posed methods, we use the example in Table 5 for er-
ror analysis. Based on our manual inspection, errors
may arise from two major sources for our method:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.747992">
• Product keyword extraction errors: we use
a pattern-based product keyword extraction
method, and it tends to incorporate some irrel-
evant words. For example, given the topic “air
pollution”, users would talk about the impact
of “car exhaust” on air quality and advocate to
reduce automobile usage and sale. The current
keyword extraction method might mistake the
word “car” for a product related keyword.
• Search engine retrieval errors: in this paper,
we rely on the Taobao product search engine
for candidate product generation. It is high-
ly based on surface-form matching to retrieve
related products. Therefore, given a query
“mouth mask”, it might return some irrelevant
products, e.g., “party mask”. Clearly, pseudo-
relevance feedback will also bring additional ir-
relevant products if top search results contain
irrelevant ones.

6.5 Parameter Sensitivity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999891875">
The only parameter for JMRA is the damping fac-
tor in the random walk model, i.e., µ. Intuitively,
a larger value of µ emphasize the associativity more
while a smaller value emphasize the relevance more.
We tune this parameter at a step of 0.1 and present
the results in Fig. 5(a). We can see the performance
of JMRAr+a+fb is consistently better than that of
JMRAr+fb and peaks at around “0.8”. It indicates
the robustness of JMRAr+a+fb and the importance
of product associtivity.
We further examine the impact of the num-
ber of top products used for pseudo feedback for
JMRAr+fb and JMRAr+a+fb. In Fig. 5(b), we can
see that both JMRAr+a+fb and JMRAr+fb achieved
their best at “3”. It indicates that we only need to
consider very top results for pseudo feedback.

6.6 Title or Description?
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999877833333333">
In previous experiments, for each product, we used
the descriptive text in both title and description. In
this part, we consider examining the individual ef-
fect of title and description. We use JMRAr+a+fb as
the examined method since both relevance and asso-
ciativity relies on the text information.

As shown in Table 6, we can see that the perfor-

of only using title and a combination of both parts
achieve the best. title is usually carefully compiled
by e-commerce sellers, thus it reveals the most high-
lights of the products but very short; while descrip-
tion contains more informative text but tends to in-
corporate noise. In future work, we will consider a
more principled way to combine title and descrip-

Finally, we present a few discussions about the issue
of efficiency. All codes were implemented in Python
2.7, and all experiments were performed on a PC
with Intel(R) Core(TM)i5 CPU 760 @ 2.8GHz and
8GB memory.
Sicne we group products by the categorial label,
the number of candidate products is usually very s-
mall. Thus, our method JMRA runs very efficiently.
Even on an extremely large set of candidate product-
s, the iterative random walk algorithm can be easily
implemented in a distributed way (Bahmani et al.,
2011) and would have very good efficiency.

7 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999840128205128">
Our work is mainly related to the following lines:
Mining the microblogs. Microblogs have been
one of the most popular social networking platform-
s, and they have recently attracted much attention
from research communities. The studies on trend
(or event) detection (Benson et al., 2011; Weng and
Lee, 2011; Sakaki et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012)
tried to make use of the rapid response of microblogs
users as the signal to automatically identify exter-
nal events. Another important aspect is the content
analysis of tweets, including the recommendation of
real-time topical news (Phelan et al., 2009), senti-
ment or opinions analysis (Meng et al., 2012), event
summarization using tweets (Chakrabarti and Puner-
a, 2011; Lin et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013), etc. Our
work do not explicitly incorporate a trend detection
component, instead we make use of the trending top-
ics provided by the microblogs platforms. It will be
easy to incorporate other trend detection methods as
our input.
Identifying online users’ commercial intents.
The identification of online users’ commercial in-
tents has been quite an important research prob-
lem in the past. Most researches focus on captur-
ing commercial intention from search queries (Dai
et al., 2006; Strohmaier and Kr¨oll, 2012), click-
through behaviors (Ashkan and Clarke, 2009), user-
s’ mouse movements or scrolling behaviors (Guo
and Agichtein, 2010) and search logs (Strohmaier
and Kr¨oll, 2012). The most related to our work is
the work in (Hollerit et al., 2013), which attempts to
detect commercial intent on twitter. But we have
very different focus. They aim to identify tweet-
level commercial intents while ours aim to identify
trend-driven commercial intents. In addition, we al-
so present how to make use of these identified intents
and our paper focuses on how to identify trend relat-
ed products for e-commerce companies to improve
service when faced with hot trends.

8 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956529411765">
In this paper, we make the first attempt to identify
trend related products by leveraging commercial in-
tents from microblogs. We propose a way to con-
struct the evaluation set for this task and present
some insightful findings. We propose a graph based
method to joint model relevance and associativity.
We perform extensive experiments, including quan-
titative and qualitative analysis.
Currently, our approach is indeed a framework
to solve this task, and we may consider improving
the individual components in it, e.g. consider non-
product keywords in tweets. For future work, we
will consider incorporating a trend detection com-
ponent into our method, which can be more flexible
to adapt to various trend signals. We can also refine
the method of the product keyword extraction by us-
ing more principled solutions.

All codes were implemented in Python 2.7, and all experiments were performed on a PC with Intel(R) Core(TM)i5 CPU 760 @ 2.8GHz and 8GB memory. Sicne we group products by the categorial label, the number of candidate products is usually very small. Thus, our method JMRA runs very efficiently. Even on an extremely large set of candidate products, the iterative random walk algorithm can be easily implemented in a distributed way (Bahmani et al., 2011) and would have very good efficiency. 7 Related Work Our work is mainly related to the following lines: Mining the microblogs. Microblogs have been one of the most popular social networking platforms, and they have recently attracted much attention from research communities. The studies on trend (or event) detection (Benson et al., 2011; Weng and Lee, 2011; Sakaki et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012) tried to make use of the rapid response of microblogs users as the signal to automatically identify external events.

Similar to Information Retrieval, we also consider using Mean Average Precision (MAP) as metrics to measure the overall quality of retrieved products. 1342 5.2 Methods to Compare We compare the following methods for inferring relating products: SALES: we rank the candidate products by their historical sales volume descendingly. TREND: we use trend keywords as queries and rank the products by their relevance. TREND+fb: based on TREND, we further incorporate pseudo-relevance feedback (Salton, 1971; Salton and Buckley, 1997). After some tuning (See Section 6.5), top 3 search results were used to update the query. JMRAr: it is our method which only considers product relevance in Section 4.1. JMRAr + fb: we further apply pseudo-relevance feedback to JMRAr. JMRAr+a: it is our method which considers both relevance and associativity in Section 4.3. JMRAr+a + fb: we further apply pseudo-relevance feedback to JMRAr+a. 6 Experimental Results and Analysis In this section, we first evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and the comparison methods.

Instead of modeling personalized intents, we consider learning a unified trenddriven intent by representing the intent as a weighted vector over these product keywords. And the key is how to set the keyword weight. Keyword weighting. A good weighting method should be able to leverage commercial interests/intents of users well and emphasize the keywords users really focus on. Thus we consider making use of the retweeting (a.k.a. forwarding) mechanism in microblogs. Retweet links are shown to be better in revealing relevance and interests (Welch et al., 2011). Formally, we use the following weighting formula for a keyword k: Weight(k) � � loglo (#rtt + 1), (1) tECk 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1.18 1.16 1.14 1.12 1.10 1.08 1.06 1.04 1.02 1.00 business person sports China movie Growth rate of sales volume product pairs are 0.039 and 0.058 respectively.9 In summary, A1 indicates that a large proportion of hot trends are potentially related to products and will exert positive effects on product sale; A2 indicates that there is a strong associativity between related products, which can be utilized to improve both precision and recall of the algorithm. 4 The Proposed</context>

Thus, our method JMRA runs very efficiently. Even on an extremely large set of candidate products, the iterative random walk algorithm can be easily implemented in a distributed way (Bahmani et al., 2011) and would have very good efficiency. 7 Related Work Our work is mainly related to the following lines: Mining the microblogs. Microblogs have been one of the most popular social networking platforms, and they have recently attracted much attention from research communities. The studies on trend (or event) detection (Benson et al., 2011; Weng and Lee, 2011; Sakaki et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2012) tried to make use of the rapid response of microblogs users as the signal to automatically identify external events. Another important aspect is the content analysis of tweets, including the recommendation of real-time topical news (Phelan et al., 2009), sentiment or opinions analysis (Meng et al., 2012), event summarization using tweets (Chakrabarti and Punera, 2011; Lin et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013), etc. Our work do not explicitly incorporate a trend detection component, instead we make use of the trending topics provided by the microblogs platfo</context>

With this method, it is easy to see that relatedness score can be propagated on the product graph, which better captures underlying associativity between products. 10Other similarity methods can be used, e.g., co-purse history record. 4.3 Jointly Modeling Relevance and Associativity Having discussed about how to model both relevance and associativity, now we are ready to present a joint model to capture these two factors. By following (Zhao et al., 2013), the main idea is that instead of using a uniform restart distribution y, we use an relevance biased restart distribution in Eq. 2. We set the restart probability of a product to its corresponding relevance. Formally, we set yi = rel(e,pi). Let us further explain the idea. At the beginning of each iteration, each product is first assigned to its relevance score: the more relevant it is, the larger score it has. During the iteration, each product begins to collect relevance evidence from its neighbors on the product graph: the more relevant neighbors it has, the larger score it obtains. And th</context>

The identification of online users’ commercial intents has been quite an important research problem in the past. Most researches focus on capturing commercial intention from search queries (Dai et al., 2006; Strohmaier and Kr¨oll, 2012), clickthrough behaviors (Ashkan and Clarke, 2009), users’ mouse movements or scrolling</context>

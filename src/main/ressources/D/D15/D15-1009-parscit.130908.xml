Abstract

In this paper, we present a comprehensive
study of the relationship between an indi-
vidual’s personal traits and his/her brand
preferences. In our analysis, we included
a large number of character traits such as
personality, personal values and individual
needs. These trait features were obtained
from both a psychometric survey and au-
tomated social media analytics. We also
included an extensive set of brand names
from diverse product categories. From this
analysis, we want to shed some light on (1)
whether it is possible to use personal traits
to infer an individual’s brand preferences
(2) whether the trait features automatically
inferred from social media are good prox-
ies for the ground truth character traits in
brand preference prediction.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.996042379310345">
Brand preference analysis is an important topic in
marketing. To induce a desired brand choice, a
marketer must understand the main factors that in-
fluence a consumer’s brand preferences. This task
is not easy since many factors may play a role
in determining one’s brand preferences such as a
consumer’s individual characteristics and prefer-
ences as well as the properties of a brand (e.g.,
its perceived quality). Among consumer related
factors, demographics such as age, gender and in-
come have been studied extensively in marketing
research (Evans, 1959; Elliott, 1994; Lin, 2002).
In this study, we focus on analyzing a set of con-
sumer characteristics, which have received less
attention but with these features, potentially we
can build more precise and more accurate brand
preference prediction models. Especially, we fo-
cus on three types of personal traits: personality,
personal values, and individual needs. Personal-
ity is a combination of characteristics or qualities
that form an individual’s distinctive character; Per-
sonal values reflect what are important to different
individuals and what motivate them in their deci-
sion making. Moreover, all people have certain
needs that they want to satisfy. Thus, analyzing a
comprehensive set of personal traits may help us
understand the way we react to a particular brand.
Previously, the relationship between personal
traits and brand preference/purchase decisions has
drawn limited interest in marketing research due
to the difficulty in obtaining consumer traits on a
large scale. Among these efforts, Westfall found
that differences exist between the personalities of
the owners of convertible cars and those of stan-
dard &amp; compact cars (Westfall, 1962). Similarly,
the congruence of personal and brand personal-
ity was suggested to be a predictor of consumers’
brand preferences (Jamal and Goode, 2001; Dik-
cius et al., 2013). However, Shank &amp; Lang-
meyer found personal traits less useful in building
a strategic marketing tool (Shank and Langmeyer,
1994).
Given limited and sometimes conflicting results
in previous research, in this study, we want to sys-
tematically investigate the relationship between a
comprehensive set of personal traits and brand
preferences. Specifically, we want to shed some
light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal
traits to predict consumer’s brand preferences? (2)
whether it is feasible to use automatically inferred
personal traits to build brand preference prediction
systems that are scalable?
Our study offers several significant contribu-
tions to the field of brand preference analysis:
1. It is the first study that includes a comprehen-
sive set of personal traits in brand preference
analysis. Our current investigation includes
personality (5 general categories and 30 sub-

facets), personal values (5 dimensions) and
individual needs (12 dimensions). In con-
trast, previous work typically only included
a small number of personal traits (e.g., just 5
personality traits in (Hirsh et al., 2012)).
2. It is the first study that uses personal traits
obtained from both psychometric evaluation
and social media analytics. The traits scores
derived from psychometric tests are more ac-
curate, which allow us to focus on the re-
lationship between personal traits and brand
preferences without the distractions from the
mistakes introduced by an automated trait in-
ference system. However, since psychomet-
ric tests require users to answer a large num-
ber of survey questions, without sufficient in-
centives, it is difficult to perform psychomet-
ric evaluation for a large number of people.
In contrast, automatically derived trait fea-
tures based on social media analytics require
no user effort, and can be applied to millions
of social media users.
3. Our study involves diverse brand categories
such as luxury car brands, retail brands, fast
food brands, and household product brands
(e.g., shampoo brands). With this data, we
can investigate whether the relationship be-
tween personal traits and brand preferences
varies across multiple product categories.
Since the current study focuses on a compre-
hensive set of consumer characteristics and pref-
erences which does not include many important
brand properties such as perceived quality, risk,
price and market presence, the main goal of our in-
vestigation is not to build a highly accurate brand
preference prediction system. Instead, we want to
first establish the feasibility of using derived trait
features in building large-scale brand preference
prediction systems. In the following, we first sum-
marize some prior work, then describe the details
of our experiments.

Predicting brand preference is a hard problem. A
large number of factors may influence customers’
choices. Table 1 summarizes the factors that have
been explored in previous research. Due to the
scope, so far, there isn’t any prior investigation
that is capable of incorporating all the factors in
a single model. Our study is one of the most com-
prehensive analyses so far. We not only investi-
gate the influence of a large number of personal
traits but also combine them with other known
consumer-related features such as demographics
and personal interests. We however have not in-
cluded any brand-related properties such as per-
ceived quality, risk and market presence because
we do not have access to these data.

In recent social media studies, Wang et al. uti-
lized customer reviews to predict coffee brand sat-
isfaction (Wang et al., 2013). Also, there is a
large-body of work trying to predict brand pref-
erences based on one’s social media posts. Most
of these work, however is performed in the con-
text of sentiment analysis. In sentiment analy-
sis, the main focus was to infer the sentiment
associated with a post that mentions a particular
brand/product. For example, Kim et al. collected
600,000 tweets that contain smartphone-related
keywords and then performed sentiment analysis
to infer whether a user’s attitude toward a par-
ticular mobile phone is positive or negative (Kim
et al., 2012). Similarly, Mostafa analyzed the
sentiment associated with 3,500+ tweets, which
showed a generally positive consumer sentiment
towards several famous brands (Mostafa, 2013).
In contrast, our trait-based analysis is more gen-
eral since it does not require users to explicitly ex-
press their opinions about a specific brand. For ex-
ample, to infer whether an individual likes BMW
or not, with sentiment analysis, a user has to ex-

plicitly express his opinion towards BMW (e.g.
Driving BMW is exciting!). In contrast, with our
system, if we know that he likes to seek excite-
ment (excitement, a needs dimension) and enjoys
luxury products (Hedonism, a values dimension),
we can guess he may like BMW although he has
never explicitly mentioned BMW in his social me-
dia posts before. This difference is important since
among the millions of products on social media,
only a small number of products have been explic-
itly rated/mentioned by a particular user.
In summary, brand preferences may be influ-
enced by many consumer and brand-related fac-
tors. Previous research has not paid sufficient at-
tention to the influence of personal traits. In ad-
dition, most previous studies used psychometric
surveys which are impractical in mass marketing
since it is unlikely that a large number of cus-
tomers would take the time to answer lengthy sur-
vey questions. In this study, we focus on inves-
tigating the feasibility of using automatically in-
ferred personal traits in large-scale brand prefer-
ence prediction. Next, we describe the dataset we
collected to support this study.

To investigate how personal traits are related to an
individual’s brand preferences, we collected two
datasets. In the first dataset, in addition to brand
preferences, we also used standard psychometric
tests to obtain clean and accurate personal trait
measures. With this dataset, we can build and
evaluate brand preference prediction models that
use accurate personal traits. In contrast, the second
dataset is used to build and evaluate brand prefer-
ence prediction models that use trait features auto-
matically inferred from social media. By compar-
ing the models built from both datasets, we can
answer questions such as: (1) whether personal
traits are useful in predicting brand preferences (2)
whether the traits automatically inferred from so-
cial media are useful in predicting brand prefer-
ences.
To collect these datasets, we designed two Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) 1 tasks. All the
MTurk participants are from the US since people
outside the US may be unfamiliar with some of the
brands. In the following, we describe the details of
each MTurk task.

3.1 Task 1: PTBP Survey
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999995619047619">
To collect the first dataset, we conducted a Per-
sonal Traits &amp; Brand Preferences (PTBP) survey.
Our trait survey includes five parts designed to
measure three types of personal traits: personal-
ity, values and needs plus demographics and per-
sonal interests. Specifically, since the Big-Five
model of personality is the most popular model
of personality traits among personality psycholo-
gists, we adopted a standard survey for Big 5 per-
sonality. Here to limit the time MTurkers need to
spend on the survey, instead of the full 300-item
personality test, we used the shorter 50-item IPIP
survey (Goldberg, 1993) which will score a user
along 5 general personality dimensions: open-
ness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeable-
ness and neuroticism. However, with the shorter
survey, we can not obtain the scores for 30 ad-
ditional personality facets. Similarly, we used
the standard 21-item PVQ survey to obtain the
values defined in Schwartz’s theory of basic val-
ues (Schwartz, 2003). We also used the 35-item
BNS survey to obtain the needs defined in Ford’s
needs model (Ford, 2005; Yang and Li, 2013). In
addition, we also included survey questions about
a user’s demographics (e.g., gender, age, marital
status, education and income) and personal inter-
ests (e.g,, automobile, sports, movies, travel) since
they were used in some previous studies on brand
preference (Pennacchiotti and Gurumurthy, 2011;
Lin, 2002). Finally for each user, we collected
her preferences for 22 brands in six categories.
We have chosen well-known brands from diverse
groups ranging from mobile phones to retail stores
and fast food restaurants. The brands within each
category are often competitors. For each brand in
each category, we asked users to rate their prefer-
ences using a 5-point scale: Love, Like, Neutral,
Dislike and Hate. A user can choose “n/a” if she
has no knowledge of a particular brand. In total,
we have collected the data from 1,207 MTurkers.
To ensure the quality of the data collected from
MTurk, we also included several validation ques-

tions. The validation questions are pairs of ques-
tions that are paraphrases of each other. If the an-
swers to a pair of validation questions are signif-
icantly different, the user data are excluded from
our analysis. Our final dataset has 1,017 valid re-
sponses. Table 2 lists all the brands used in our

3.2 Task 2: TAE Survey
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998959178571429">
The data collected in the Text Analytics Evalu-
ation (TAE) survey are used to study the corre-
lation between the trait features inferred from a
person’s social media posts (e.g., tweets) and his
brand preferences. Before the TAE survey, the
participants were first asked to verify whether they
had a Twitter account, if so, provide us their Twit-
ter IDs. The users also agreed that we could access
their tweets after the survey. Since our automated
trait inference system relies on linguistic cues de-
rived from a person’s Twitter posts, to ensure we
can have a stable and reliable reading of one’s
personal traits from his tweets, only active Twit-
ter users with over 50 tweets (excluding retweets)
can participate this survey. Since the majority of
MTurkers are not active Twitter users, to increase
the size of our data, in addition to MTurk, we also
directly invited random Twitter users to participate
in our TAE survey.
In addition to Twitter IDs, we also asked par-
ticipants to provide their preferences for the same
22 brands as those used in the PTBP survey. Simi-
larly, to filter out data by people who do not follow
instructions, we also added two validation ques-
tions. In total, in the TAE survey, we have col-
lected data from 659 participants, out of which
608 are valid. (550 valid ones are from MTurk,
and 109 are from direct Twitter invitation).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995033">
3.3 Data Preparation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999916978723404">
To obtain the trait scores for each user based on his
answers in the PTBP survey, we first computed the
raw trait scores based on the original survey guide-
lines. Since different surveys used different scales,
we normalized the trait scores by using their rank
percentile (e.g., top 1%, top 5%). As a result, all
the normalized personal trait scores are between 0
and 1.
Moreover, for each of the 20 topics of interest,
we created a binary variable, indicating whether
a participant is interested in a specific topic. In
addition, each demographics feature such as age,
education, income, was first mapped to an integer
and then normalized into a number between 0 and
1.
To derive the trait scores for a user in the TAE
survey, we crawled all the tweets in his Twitter
account. Since personal traits are inferred from
the text authored by a user, we discarded all the
retweets. Due to the restrictions of the Twit-
ter API, we can only crawl a maximum of 3,200
tweets for each user2.
Recent research in psycholinguistics has shown
it is possible to automatically infer personal traits
from one’s linguistic footprints such as tweets and
blogs (Yarkoni, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Yang
and Li, 2013). Here, we used a similar ap-
proach. Specifically, given input text authored by a
user (e.g., tweets), our system computed the word
counts of different psychologically-meaningful
word categories defined in the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary (Pennebaker
et al., 2001). The LIWC counts were then used
to build prediction models to correlate one’s word
usage with his ground truth personal traits ob-
tained via a prior psychometric survey. Then the
built models were used to automatically infer a
user’s personal traits. Based on a preliminary eval-
uation with 250 participants, more than 80 per-
cent of them, scores for traits that were inferred
for all three models correlated significantly with
survey-based scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation coef-
ficient between 0.05 and 0.8). Specifically, scores
that were derived by our system correlated with
survey-based scores for 80.8% of participants’ Big
Five scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation coefficients
between 0.05 and 0.75), for 86.6% of participants’

Needs scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation coefficient
between 0.05 and 0.8), and for 98.21% of partic-
ipants’ Values scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation co-
efficients between 0.05 and 0.55). Moreover, the
participants also rated on a five-point scale how
well each derived characteristic matched their per-
ceptions of themselves, and their ratings suggest
that the inferred characteristics largely matched
their self-perceptions. Specifically, means of all
ratings were above 3 (“somewhat”) out of 5 (“per-
fect”): 3.4 (with a std. of 1.14) for Big Five, 3.39
(with a std. of 1.34) for Needs, and 3.13 (with a
std. of 1.17) for Values.
In addition to personal traits, we also included
topics of interest in the TAE dataset. They were
automatically inferred from tweets using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).
Since we need a large Twitter dataset to mine a list
of general topics of interest, our current tweet col-
lection is not sufficient. Therefore, we use a sep-
arate and much larger Twitter dataset from 10,000
randomly selected Twitter users. For each user, we
crawled his tweets and then aggregated them into
a big document, one for each Twitter user. As a re-
sult, we have 10,000 documents in our dataset. We
then built an LDA topic model using this dataset.
From the LDA inference results, we can infer a
user’s topics of interest. Basically, for a given user
u, LDA outputs a per user topic distribution Θu,
which is a T-dimensional vector where T is the
number of topics. The value Ou,Z is an indication of
how likely Topic i is mentioned in user u’s tweets.
The higher Ou,Z is, the more likely that user u is
interested in topic i. Table 4 shows some of the
topics automatically learned by LDA.

et al., 2009). Since our current goal is not to build
the best brand preference prediction system, but to
show the feasibility of building brand preference
prediction systems that are scalable to millions of
users, we ran all our classifiers using the default
parameter settings from Weka (E.g. for Random
Forest, we used 10 trees. The umber of features
was set to log2(number of all features)+1.). We
expect in the future, by optimizing model parame-
ters, we can further improve the prediction power
of each model.
The baseline classifiers classify every data in-
stance into the majority class. Among all the
classifiers we tested, we found that overall Naive
Bayes has the best performance on both the PTBP
and the TAE datasets. In the following, we report
the average F-scores and AUC across 22 different
brands using Naive Bayes with 10-fold cross val-
idations. We created models that use all the user
features and also those that use only trait features.
Table 7 shows the results.

Overall, all the classifiers performed signifi-
cantly better than the baselines (p&lt;0.05). More-
over, the models using all the features performed
similarly to those using only trait features. The
differences are not statistically significant. In ad-
dition, comparing the models trained on the PTBP
data with those on the TAE dataset, their perfor-
mances are very similar, although the exact num-
bers are not directly comparable since they are
from two different datasets.
To break down the results by product category,
in Table 8, we list the per-brand classification re-
sults using only the trait features. The numbers
in the parentheses show the F-score percentage in-
crease from the baselines. In general, models with
trait features did much better than the baselines on
both datasets. But their effectiveness varied from
one brand to another. For example, the trait fea-
tures were very effective in predicting user prefer-
ences for Cadillac (50.8% increase on the PTBP
dataset and 68.5% increase on the TAE dataset).
In contrast, there was barely any improvement for
Target. After inspecting the data, it seems this
may be caused by the distribution of the data. For
instance, the Target TAE data was very skewed.
There were 430 people who had positive opinions
about Target versus 18 people who had negative
opinions. Since the baseline predicts “all people
like Target”, which resulted in a pretty high F-
score (0.781), any further improvement over this
baseline became more difficult.

In summary, for the task of differentiating peo-
ple who have positive, negative, or neutral opin-
ions towards different brands, automatically in-
ferred traits can be a good proxy for the clean data
derived from psychometric surveys. Models based
on the trait features inferred from social media can
perform similarly to those using a much larger set
of clean features. This result is encouraging since

<bodyText confidence="0.999884724137931">
In this study, we want to find out what are the most
significant features that can be used to differenti-
ate a brand’s likers from dislikers. The feature se-
lection was conducted using logistic regression in
SPSS3. Due to the page limit, we cannot list all the
significant features for all the 22 brands. Here we
only show the most important features in predict-
ing people who like and dislike luxury car brands
based on the PTBP dataset (Table 9). Based on
the regression analysis, all the features are sig-
nificantly associated with brand preferences ( p&lt;
0.05). In this table, personal trait features are high-
lighted and followed by their types: P (Personali-
ties), V (Values), and N (Needs). “+” or “-” means
the features contribute positively or negatively to
the model. As shown in the table, more than half
of all the top features are trait features. For ex-
ample, the No. one trait feature to differentiate
BMW likers from dislikers is ideal, a trait associ-
ated with people who have a desire for perfection.
For Cadillac, the top trait is hedonism, which is
often associated with people who pursue pleasure
and sensuous gratification in life. For Lexus, the
most useful feature is self-expression, a trait often
associated with people who have a desire to assert
their own identifies. Other interesting findings in-
clude that females are less likely to be a fan of a
luxury car brand than males. This is true across all
three luxury car brands.

given a list of competing brands in the same prod-

For each user, we rank all the brands in each prod-

vey (e.g., 1 means most preferred brand). We ag-
gregate the ranks from all the users and show the
overall brand preference ranks for both datasets.
As shown in table 10, the overall brand preference
ranks for the PTBP and TAE surveys are highly
correlated. Half of the product categories have ex-
act the same preference ranks for all the products;
The other half has only one slightly mis-matched
rank in each product category. This suggests that
the population participated in the PTBP and TAE
survey has very similar brand preference distribu-
tions. In the future, it maybe interesting to inves-
tigate how this rank is related to different brands’
market share.

To predict the rank of a product in each category,
we trained a multi-class classifier to estimate how
likely a user will like a brand. For example, for
smart phone brands, since we have four compet-
ing brands, we train a 4-way classifier to estimate
the likelihood a person likes iPhone, HTC, Nokia
and Sony. We then output the preference rank
based on the estimated likelihood. Higher likeli-
hood means a stronger preference. We also built

two types of models, one used all the user features,
the other used traits only. We applied them to both
the PTBP and the TAE datasets.
Since our model and the ground truth both pro-
duce a ranked list for each product category, here
we used rank correlation analysis to evaluate the
quality of the predicted ranks. For each user and
each product category, we computed the Spear-
man’s rank correlation coefficient p. If the coef-
ficient p is 1, there is a perfect positive correlation
between the predict rank and the ground truth (i.e.
both produce identical ranks). If p is -1, there is a
perfect negative correlation between the predicted
rank and the ground truth (i.e., the rank predicted
by the system is exactly the opposite of the ground
truth). If p is 0 , then the predicted rank and the
ground truth are randomly related. For each prod-
uct category, we report the average p across all the
users.

We use the overall rank data in Table 10 as our
baseline. Specifically, for each product category,
the baseline always ranks all its brands based on
the average ranks defined in Table 10. For each
user and each product category, we compute the p
between the user’s ground truth rank in the survey
and the rank produced by the baseline. We com-
pute the average p across all the users and all the
product categories to represent the baseline perfor-
mance. For the PTBP data, the average p for the
baseline is 0.193. For the TAE data, the average p
is 0.060.
There are several main findings from these re-
sults. First, for all the product categories, the
predicted ranks are all significantly and positively
correlated with the ground truth (p &lt; 0.05). Also,
our models perform significantly better than the
non-personalized ranks produced by the baseline.
This result is important because it shows that there
is a stable and statistically significant agreement
between the predicted ranks and the ground truth
and the personalized models with additional trait
features perform significantly better than the non-
personalized baseline system (on PTBP, the aver-
age p of the model with personal traits is 0.305
versus 0.193 of the baseline. It is 0.403 versus
0.060 on the TAE dataset). Second, the perfor-
mance on the TAE dataset is better than that on
the PTBP dataset (e.g., the average p is 0.403 on
TAE versus 0.305 on PTBP when only trait fea-
tures were used). This may be due to the fact that
in the TAE dataset, in addition to the Big 5 person-
ality features, we also automatically extracted 30
personality sub-facets from tweets using the pro-
cedure described in (Yarkoni, 2010). These finer-
grained personality features are not available in
the PTBP dataset. This result is encouraging since
it suggests that using automatically inferred traits
can predict brand preferences as well as if not bet-
ter than the clean trait features that can be obtained
only through costly psychometric evaluations. Fi-
nally, for our models, since the overall correlation
coefficients p are between 0.3 and 0.4, the strength
of these correlations is moderate. Thus, it may
not be sufficient to build an accurate brand pref-
erence prediction system with only user features.
Other features especially brand-related features as
well as features that capture the compatibility of a
brand and a user are needed.

a user’s preference of competing brands within a
product category. Our findings demonstrated that
it is possible to use personal traits in predicting
a user’s brand preferences. Moreover, we have
also shown that automatically inferred user fea-
tures are good proxies for the clean trait features
that can be acquired only from costly psychome-
tric surveys. This work may have significant im-
pact on the field of brand preference analysis since
this suggests that it is possible for businesses to
build scalable marketing tools to identify and tar-
get potential customers on social media.
Brand preference prediction is a hard problem.
So far, we have focused primarily on user features.
To further improve the prediction accuracy, in the
future, we will extend our current study by incor-
porating new features such as the properties of a
brand as well social influence from people in one’s
social network.

<abstract confidence="0.998735842105263">In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the relationship between an individual’s personal traits and his/her brand preferences. In our analysis, we included a large number of character traits such as personality, personal values and individual needs. These trait features were obtained from both a psychometric survey and automated social media analytics. We also included an extensive set of brand names from diverse product categories. From this analysis, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal traits to infer an individual’s brand preferences (2) whether the trait features automatically inferred from social media are good proxies for the ground truth character traits in brand preference prediction.</abstract>

Specifically, means of all ratings were above 3 (“somewhat”) out of 5 (“perfect”): 3.4 (with a std. of 1.14) for Big Five, 3.39 (with a std. of 1.34) for Needs, and 3.13 (with a std. of 1.17) for Values. In addition to personal traits, we also included topics of interest in the TAE dataset. They were automatically inferred from tweets using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). Since we need a large Twitter dataset to mine a list of general topics of interest, our current tweet collection is not sufficient. Therefore, we use a separate and much larger Twitter dataset from 10,000 randomly selected Twitter users. For each user, we crawled his tweets and then aggregated them into a big document, one for each Twitter user. As a result, we have 10,000 documents in our dataset. We then built an LDA topic model using this dataset. From the LDA inference results, we can infer a user’s topics of interest. Basically, for a given user u, LDA outputs a per user topic distribut</context>

For each brand, we built threeway classifiers using different classification algorithms including AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1996), Decision Tree (C4.5) (Quinlan, 1993), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest (Breiman, 2001), and SVM (Platt, 1999).

Since personal traits are inferred from the text authored by a user, we discarded all the retweets. Due to the restrictions of the Twitter API, we can only crawl a maximum of 3,200 tweets for each user2. Recent research in psycholinguistics has shown it is possible to automatically infer personal traits from one’s linguistic footprints such as tweets and blogs (Yarkoni, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Yang and Li, 2013). Here, we used a similar approach. Specifically, given input text authored by a user (e.g., tweets), our system computed the word counts of different psychologically-meaningful word categories defined in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2001). The LIWC counts were then used to build prediction models to correlate one’s word usage with his ground truth personal traits obtained via a prior psychometric survey. Then the built models were used to automatically infer a user’s personal traits. Based on a preliminary evaluation with 250 </context>

Previously, the relationship between personal traits and brand preference/purchase decisions has drawn limited interest in marketing research due to the difficulty in obtaining consumer traits on a large scale. Among these efforts, Westfall found that differences exist between the personalities of the owners of convertible cars and those of standard &amp; compact cars (Westfall, 1962). Similarly, the congruence of personal and brand personality was suggested to be a predictor of consumers’ brand preferences (Jamal and Goode, 2001; Dikcius et al., 2013). However, Shank &amp; Langmeyer found personal traits less useful in building a strategic marketing tool (Shank and Langmeyer, 1994). Given limited and sometimes conflicting results in previous research, in this study, we want to systematically investigate the relationship between a comprehensive set of personal traits and brand preferences. Specifically, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal traits to predict consumer’s brand preferences? (2) whether it is feasible to use automatically inferred personal traits to build brand preference prediction systems that a</context>

Among consumer related factors, demographics such as age, gender and income have been studied extensively in marketing research (Evans, 1959; Elliott, 1994; Lin, 2002).

Finally for each user, we collected her preferences for 22 brands in six categories. We have chosen well-known brands from diverse groups ranging from mobile phones to retail stores and fast food restaurants. The brands within each category are often competitors. </context>

The traits scores derived from psychometric tests are more accurate, which allow us to focus on the relationship between personal traits and brand preferences without the distractions from the mistakes introduced by an automated trait inference system. However, since psychometric tests require users to answer a large number of survey questions, without sufficient incentives, it is difficult to perform psychometric evaluation for a large number of people.

Previously, the relationship between personal traits and brand preference/purchase decisions has drawn limited interest in marketing research due to the difficulty in obtaining consumer traits on a large scale. Among these efforts, Westfall found that differences exist between the personalities of the owners of convertible cars and those of standard &amp; compact cars (Westfall, 1962). Similarly, the congruence of personal and brand personality was suggested to be a predictor of consumers’ brand preferences (Jamal and Goode, 2001; Dikcius et al., 2013). However, Shank &amp; Langmeyer found personal traits less useful in building a strategic marketing tool (Shank and Langmeyer, 1994). Given limited and sometimes conflicting results in previous research, in this study, we want to systematically investigate the relationship between a comprehensive set of personal traits and brand preferences. Specifically, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal traits to predict consumer’s brand preferences? (2) whether it is feasible to use automatically inferred personal traits to build brand preference pr</context>

To induce a desired brand choice, a marketer must understand the main factors that influence a consumer’s brand preferences. This task is not easy since many factors may play a role in determining one’s brand preferences such as a consumer’s individual characteristics and preferences as well as the properties of a brand (e.g., its perceived quality). Among consumer related factors, demographics such as age, gender and income have been studied extensively in marketing research (Evans, 1959; Elliott, 1994; Lin, 2002). In this study, we focus on analyzing a set of consumer characteristics, which have received less attention but with these features, potentially we can build more precise and more accurate brand preference prediction models. Especially, we focus on three types of personal traits: personality, personal values, and individual needs. Personality is a combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual’s distinctive character; Personal values reflect what are important to different individuals and what motivate them in their decision making. Moreover, all people have certain needs</context>

Similarly, we used the standard 21-item PVQ survey to obtain the values defined in Schwartz’s theory of basic values (Schwartz, 2003). We also used the 35-item BNS survey to obtain the needs defined in Ford’s needs model (Ford, 2005; Yang and Li, 2013). In addition, we also included survey questions about a user’s demographics (e.g., gender, age, marital status, education and income) and personal interests (e.g,, automobile, sports, movies, travel) since they were used in some previous studies on brand preference (Pennacchiotti and Gurumurthy, 2011; Lin, 2002). Finally for each user, we collected her preferences for 22 brands in six categories. We have chosen well-known brands from diverse groups ranging from mobile phones to retail stores and fast food restaurants. The brands within each category are often competitors. For each brand in each category, we asked users to rate their preferences using a 5-point scale: Love, Like, Neutral, Dislike and Hate. A user can choose “n/a” if she has no knowledge of a particular brand. In total, we have collected the data from 1,207 MTurkers.

Finally for each user, we collected her preferences for 22 brands in six categories. We have chosen well-known brands from diverse groups ranging from mobile phones to retail stores and fast food restaurants. The brands within each category are often competitors. For each brand in each category, we asked users to rate their preferences using a 5-point scale: Love, Like, Neutral, Dislike and Hate.

Due to the restrictions of the Twitter API, we can only crawl a maximum of 3,200 tweets for each user2. Recent research in psycholinguistics has shown it is possible to automatically infer personal traits from one’s linguistic footprints such as tweets and blogs (Yarkoni, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Yang and Li, 2013). Here, we used a similar approach. Specifically, given input text authored by a user (e.g., tweets), our system computed the word counts of different psychologically-meaningful word categories defined in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2001). The LIWC counts were then used to build prediction models to correlate one’s word usage with his ground truth personal traits obtained via a prior psychometric survey. Then the built models were used to automatically infer a user’s personal traits. Based on a preliminary evaluation with 250 participants, more than 80 percent of them, scores for traits that were inferred for all three models correlated significantly with survey-based scores (p&lt;0.05 and correlation coefficient between 0.05 and 0.8). Specifically, scores that were derived by our system correlated with survey-based scores for 80</context>

Among these efforts, Westfall found that differences exist between the personalities of the owners of convertible cars and those of standard &amp; compact cars (Westfall, 1962). Similarly, the congruence of personal and brand personality was suggested to be a predictor of consumers’ brand preferences (Jamal and Goode, 2001; Dikcius et al., 2013). However, Shank &amp; Langmeyer found personal traits less useful in building a strategic marketing tool (Shank and Langmeyer, 1994). Given limited and sometimes conflicting results in previous research, in this study, we want to systematically investigate the relationship between a comprehensive set of personal traits and brand preferences. Specifically, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal traits to predict consumer’s brand preferences? (2) whether it is feasible to use automatically inferred personal traits to build brand preference prediction systems that are scalable? Our study offers several significant contributions to the field of brand preference analysis: 1. It is the first stu</context>

Also, there is a large-body of work trying to predict brand preferences based on one’s social media posts. Most of these work, however is performed in the context of sentiment analysis. In sentiment analysis, the main focus was to infer the sentiment associated with a post that mentions a particular brand/product. For example, Kim et al. collected 600,000 tweets that contain smartphone-related keywords and then performed sentiment analysis to infer whether a user’s attitude toward a particular mobile phone is positive or negative (Kim et al., 2012). Similarly, Mostafa analyzed the sentiment </context>

Moreover, all people have certain needs that they want to satisfy. Thus, analyzing a comprehensive set of personal traits may help us understand the way we react to a particular brand. Previously, the relationship between personal traits and brand preference/purchase decisions has drawn limited interest in marketing research due to the difficulty in obtaining consumer traits on a large scale. Among these efforts, Westfall found that differences exist between the personalities of the owners of convertible cars and those of standard &amp; compact cars (Westfall, 1962). Similarly, the congruence of personal and brand personality was suggested to be a predictor of consumers’ brand preferences (Jamal and Goode, 2001; Dikcius et al., 2013). However, Shank &amp; Langmeyer found personal traits less useful in building a strategic marketing tool (Shank and Langmeyer, 1994). Given limited and sometimes conflicting results in previous research, in this study, we want to systematically investigate the relationship between a comprehensive set of personal traits and brand preferences. Specifically, we want to shed some light on (1) whether it is possible to use personal t</context>

However, with the shorter survey, we can not obtain the scores for 30 additional personality facets. Similarly, we used the standard 21-item PVQ survey to obtain the values defined in Schwartz’s theory of basic values (Schwartz, 2003). We also used the 35-item BNS survey to obtain the needs defined in Ford’s needs model (Ford, 2005; Yang and Li, 2013). In addition, we also included survey questions about a user’s demographics (e.g., gender, age, marital status, education and income) and personal interests (e.g,, automobile, sports, movies, travel) since they were used in some previous studies on brand preference (Pennacchiotti and Gurumurthy, 2011; Lin, 2002). Finally for each user, we collected her preferences for 22 brands in six categories. We have chosen well-known brands from diverse groups ranging from mobile phones to retail stores and fast food restaurants. The brands within each category are often competitors.

To derive the trait scores for a user in the TAE survey, we crawled all the tweets in his Twitter account. Since personal traits are inferred from the text authored by a user, we discarded all the retweets. Due to the restrictions of the Twitter API, we can only crawl a maximum of 3,200 tweets for each user2. Recent research in psycholinguistics has shown it is possible to automatically infer personal traits from one’s linguistic footprints such as tweets and blogs (Yarkoni, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Yang and Li, 2013). Here, we used a similar approach. Specifically, given input text authored by a user (e.g., tweets), our system computed the word counts of different psychologically-meaningful word categories defined in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary (Pennebaker et al., 2001). The LIWC counts were then used to build prediction models to correlate one’s word usage with his ground truth personal traits obtained via a prior psychometric survey. Then the built models were used to automatically infer a user’s personal traits. Based on a preliminary evaluation with 250 participants, more t</context>

It is 0.403 versus 0.060 on the TAE dataset). Second, the performance on the TAE dataset is better than that on the PTBP dataset (e.g., the average p is 0.403 on TAE versus 0.305 on PTBP when only trait features were used). This may be due to the fact that in the TAE dataset, in addition to the Big 5 personality features, we also automatically extracted 30 personality sub-facets from tweets using the procedure described in (Yarkoni, 2010). These finergrained personality features are not available in the PTBP dataset. This result is encouraging since it suggests that using automatically inferred traits can predict brand preferences as well as if not better than the clean trait features that can be obtained only through costly psychometric evaluations. Finally, for our models, since the overall correlation coefficients p are between 0.3 and 0.4, the strength of these correlations is moderate. Thus, it may not be sufficient to build an accurate brand preference prediction system with only user features. Other features especially </context>

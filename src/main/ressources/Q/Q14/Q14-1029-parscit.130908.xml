Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99876812">
We present a method for discovering abstract
event classes in biographies, based on a prob-
abilistic latent-variable model. Taking as in-
put timestamped text, we exploit latent corre-
lations among events to learn a set of event
classes (such as BORN, GRADUATES HIGH
SCHOOL, and BECOMES CITIZEN), along
with the typical times in a person’s life when
those events occur. In a quantitative evalua-
tion at the task of predicting a person’s age
for a given event, we find that our genera-
tive model outperforms a strong linear regres-
sion baseline, along with simpler variants of
the model that ablate some features. The ab-
stract event classes that we learn allow us
to perform a large-scale analysis of 242,970
Wikipedia biographies. Though it is known
that women are greatly underrepresented on
Wikipedia—not only as editors (Wikipedia,
2011) but also as subjects of articles (Reagle
and Rhue, 2011)—we find that there is a bias
in their characterization as well, with biogra-
phies of women containing significantly more
emphasis on events of marriage and divorce
than biographies of men.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999552644444444">
The written text that we interact with on an everyday
basis—news articles, emails, social media, books—
contains a vast amount of information centered on
people: news (including common NLP corpora such
as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal)
details the roles of actors in current events, social
media (including Twitter and Facebook) documents
the actions and attitudes of friends, and books chron-
icle the stories of fictional characters and real people
alike. This focus on people gives us an abundance of
information on how the lives of those portrayed un-
fold; for corpora that include historically deep bi-
ographical information (such as Wikipedia, book-
length biographies and autobiographies, and even
newspaper obituaries) this data includes the actors
involved in particular historical events and the times
and places in which they occur. The life events de-
scribed in these texts have natural structure: event
classes exhibit correlations with each other (e.g.,
those who DIVORCE must have been MARRIED),
can occur at roughly similar times in the lives of dif-
ferent individuals (MARRIAGE is more likely to oc-
cur earlier in one’s life than later), and can be bound
to historical moments as well (FIGHTS IN WORLD
WAR II peaks in the early 1940s).
Social scientists have long been interested in the
structure of these events in investigating the role
that individual agency and larger social forces play
in shaping the course of an individual’s life. Life
stages marking “transitions to adulthood” (such as
LEAVING SCHOOL, ENTERING THE WORKFORCE
and MARRIAGE) have important correlates with de-
mographic variables (Modell et al., 1976; Hogan
and Astone, 1986; Shanahan, 2000); and researchers
study the interactional effects that life events have
on each other, such as the relationship between di-
vorce and pre-marital cohabitation (Lillard et al.,
1995; Reinhold, 2010) or having children (Lillard
and Waite, 1993).
The data on which these studies draw, however,
has largely been restricted to categorical surveys
and observational data; we present here a latent-
variable model that exploits the correlations of event
descriptions in text to learn the structure of abstract
events, grounded in time, from text alone. While our

birth dates of a set of mentioned entities are known,
we illustrate our method on a large-scale dataset of
242,970 biographies extracted from Wikipedia.
This paper makes two contributions: first, we
present a general unsupervised model for learning
life event classes from biographical text, along with
the structure that binds them; second, in using this
method to learn event classes from Wikipedia, we
uncover evidence of systematic bias in the presen-
tation of male and female biographies (with biogra-
phies of women containing significantly dispropor-
tionate emphasis on the personal events of mar-
riage and divorce). In addition to these contribu-
tions, we also present a range of other analyses that
uncovering life events in text can make possible.

<bodyText confidence="0.999767181818182">
The data for this analysis originates in the January
2, 2014 dump of English-language Wikipedia.1 We
extract biographies by identifying all articles with
persondata metadata2 in which the DATE OF
BIRTH field is known. This results in a set of
927,403 biographies.
For each biography, we perform part-of-speech
tagging using the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova
et al., 2003) and named entity recognition using
the Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al.,
2005), cluster all mentions of co-referring proper
names (Davis et al., 2003; Elson et al., 2010) and
resolve pronominal co-reference (Bamman et al.,
2014), aided by gender inference for each entity as
the gender corresponding to the maximum number
of gendered pronouns (i.e., he and she) mentioned
in the article, as also used by Reagle and Rhue
(2011). In a random test set of 500 articles, this
method of gender inference is overwhelmingly ac-
curate, achieving 100% precision with 97.6% recall
(12 articles had no pronominal mentions and so gen-
der is not assigned).

should be added to biographical articles only” (http://en.

<bodyText confidence="0.999768">
As further preprocessing, we identify multiword
expressions in all texts as maximal sequences of
adjective + noun part of speech tags (yielding, for
example, New York, United States, early life and
high school), as first described in Justeson and Katz
(1995). For each biographical article, we then ex-
tract all sentences in which the subject of the ar-
ticle is mentioned along with a single date and re-
tain only the terms in each sentence that are among
the most frequent 10,000 unigrams and multiword
expressions in all documents, excluding stopwords
such as the and all numbers (including dates). An
“event” is the bag of these unigrams and multiword
expressions extracted from one such sentence, along
with a corresponding timestamp measured as the dif-
ference between the observed date in the sentence
and the date of birth of the entity.
Table 1 illustrates the actual form of the data with
a sample of extracted sentences from the biography
of Frank Lloyd Wright, along with the data as input
to the model. In the terminology of the model de-
scribed below, each sentence constitutes one “event”
in the subject’s life.
For the final dataset we retain all biographies
where the subject of the article is born after the
year 1800 and for which there exist at least 5 events
(242,970 people). The complete data consists of
2,313,867 events across these 242,970 people.

The quantities of interest that we want to learn from
the data are: 1.) a broad set of major life events
recorded in Wikipedia biographies that people expe-
rience at similar stages in their lives (such as BEING
BORN, GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL, SERVING IN
THE ARMY, GETTING MARRIED, and so on); 2.)
correlations among those life events (e.g., knowing
that if an individual WINS A NOBEL PRIZE that
they’re more likely to RECEIVE AN HONORARY
DOCTORATE); and 3.) an attribution of those classes
of events to particular moments in a specific indi-
vidual’s life (e.g., John Nash RECEIVED AN HON-
ORARY DOCTORATE in 1999).
We cast this problem as an unsupervised learning
one; given no labeled instances, can we infer these
quantities from text alone? One possible alterna-

information contained in Wikipedia biographies (or
its derivatives, such as Freebase; Google, 2014) as
a form of supervision (e.g., George Washington is a
member of the categories Presidents of the United
States and American cartographers, among others).
These manual categories, however, are often spo-
radically annotated and have a long tail (with most
categories appearing very few times); in learning
event structure directly from text, we avoid relying
on categories’ accuracy and being constrained by a
fixed ontology. One advantage of an unsupervised
approach is that we eliminate the need to define a
pre-determined set of event classes a priori, allow-
ing application across a variety of different domains
and time periods, such as full-text books from the
Internet Archive or Hathi Trust, or historical works
like the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography
(Matthew and Harrison, 2004).
Figure 1a illustrates the graphical form of our hi-
erarchical Bayesian model, which articulates the re-
lationship between an entity’s set of events (where
each event is an observation defined as the bag of
terms in text and the difference between the year
it was recorded as happening and the birth year),
an abstract set of event classes, correlations among
those abstract classes, and the distribution of vocab-
ulary terms that defines each one. To capture corre-
lations among different classes, we place a logistic
normal prior on each biography’s distribution over
event classes (Blei and Lafferty, 2006a; Blei and
Lafferty, 2007; Mimno et al., 2008); unlike a Dirich-
let, a logistic normal is able to capture arbitrary cor-
relations between elements through the structure of
the covariance matrix of its underlying multivariate
normal. We take a Bayesian approach to estimating
the mean µη and covariance Eη, drawing them from
a conjugate Normal-Inverse Wishart prior.
The generative story for the model runs as fol-
lows: let K be the number of latent event classes, P
be the number of biographies, and Ep be the number
of events in biography p.

Here c−(k, v) is the count of the number of times

all events whose current z = k (again excepting the
current one), Ne is the number of terms in event e,
and e(v) is the count of vocabulary term v in the cur-
rent event. (Note the complexity of the last term is
due to drawing multiple observations from a single
collapsed multinomial; Carpenter, 2010.)

q: if a document contains many examples of z = k
and zk is highly correlated with zj, then the optimal
q is encouraged to contain high weights at both qk
and qj rather than simply qk alone.
Maximizing pη, Eη, p, A Given values for q, we
then find maximum a posteriori estimates of pη
and Eη conditioned on the Normal-Inverse Wishart
(NIW) prior. The NIW is a conjugate prior to a mul-
tivariate Gaussian, parameterized by dimensionality
K, initial mean p0, positive-definite scale matrix Ψ,
and scalars v &gt; K − 1 and A &gt; 0. The prior
parameters Ψ and v have an intuitive interpretation
as the scatter matrix Eνi=1 (xi − ¯x) (xi − ¯x)T for v
pseudo-observations.
The expected value of the covariance matrix
drawn from a NIW distribution parameterized by Ψ
and v is Ψ
ν−K−1. To disprefer correlations among
topics in the absence of strong evidence, we fix
p0 = 0 and set Ψ so that this prior expectation over
Eη is the product of a scalar value p and the iden-
tity matrix I: Ψ = (v − K − 1)pI; p defines the
expected variance, and the higher the value of v, the
more strongly the prior dominates the posterior es-
timate of the covariance matrix (i.e., the more the
covariance matrix is shrunk toward pI). A likewise
has an intuitive understanding as a dampening pa-
rameter: the higher its value, the more the posterior
estimate of the mean pˆ shrinks toward 0. For n data
points, we set A = n/10, v = K + 2, and p = 1.
Since the NIW is conjugate with the multivariate
normal, posterior updates to pη and Eη have closed-
form expressions given values of q (here, q¯ denotes
the mean value of q over all biographies).

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.86713087755102">
While the goal of this work is to learn qualitative
categories of life events from text, we can quantita-
tively evaluate the performance of our model on the
empirical task of predicting the age in a person’s life
when an event occurs.
For this task, we compare the full model described
above with a strong baseline of f2-regularized linear
regression and also with comparable models with
feature ablations, in order to quantify the extent to
which various aspects of the full model are con-
tributing to its empirical performance. The compa-
rable ablated models include the following:
• –CORRELATION, figure 1b. Rather than a lo-
gistic normal prior on the entity-specific distri-
bution over event types (q), we draw q from a
symmetric Dirichlet distribution parameterized
by a global a. In a Dirichlet distribution, arbi-
trary correlations cannot be captured.
• –TIME, figure 1c. In the full model, the time-
stamps of the observed events influence the
event classes we learn by encouraging them to
be internally coherent and time-sensitive. To
test this design choice, we ablate time as a fea-
ture during inference.
• –CORRELATION,–TIME, figure 1d. We also
test a model that ablates both the correlation
structure in the prior and the influence of time;
this model corresponds to smoothed, unsuper-
vised naive Bayes.
As during inference, we define an event to be the
set of terms, excluding stopwords and numbers, that
are present in the vocabulary of the 10,000 most fre-
quent words and multiword expressions in the data
overall. Each event is accompanied by the year of its
occurrence, from which we calculate the gold target
prediction (the age of the person at the time of the
event) as the year minus the entity’s year of birth.
For all of the four models described above (the full
model and three ablations), we train the model on
4/5 of the biographies (194,376 entities, on average
1,851,094 events); we split the remaining 1/5 of the
biographies into development data (where t is ob-
served) and test data (where t is predicted). The de-
tails of inference for each model are as follows:
1. FULL. Inference as above for a burn-in period
of 100 iterations, using slice sampling (Neal,

Gibbs sampling for 100 iterations, using slice

each test event as the mean time marginalizing

event classes K E {10, 25, 50,100, 250, 500}. Lin-
ear regression represents a powerful model, achiev-
ing a mean absolute error of 11.87 years across all
folds, but is eclipsed by the latent variable model at
K ≥ 50. The correlations captured by the logis-
tic normal prior make a clear difference, uniformly
yielding improvements over otherwise equivalent
Dirichlet models across all K. As expected, mod-
els trained without knowledge of time during infer-
ence perform less well than models that contain that
information.

Emerging immediately from this summary is an

ipants in most event classes to be female. Figures
3 and 4 illustrate five of the most highly skewed
classes in both directions, ranked according to the z
score of a two-tailed binomial proportion test (Ho =
14.8).
While some of these classes reflect a biased world
in which more men are drafted into sports teams,
serve in the armed forces, and are ordained as
priests, one latent class that calls out for explanation
is that surrounding DIVORCE (divorce, marriage, di-
vorced, filed, married, wife, separated, years, ended,
later), whose female proportion of 39.4% is nearly
triple that of the data overall (and whose z-score re-
veals it to be strongly statistically different [p

Bonferroni correction we must make when consider-

ranking). While we did not approach this analy-
sis with any a priori hypotheses to test, our unsu-
pervised model reveals an interesting hypothesis to
pursue with confirmatory analysis: biographies of
women on Wikipedia disproportionately focus on
marriage and divorce compared to those of men.

means, we estimated the empirical gender propor-
tions of biographies containing terms explicitly de-
noting divorce (divorced, divorce, divorces and di-
vorcing). The result of this analysis confirms that
of the model. Of the 4,608 biographies in which
at least one of these terms appears, 38.8% are
those of a woman, far more than the 14.8% we
would expect (in a two-tailed binomial proportion
test against Ho = 14.8, this difference is significant
at p &lt; 0.0001); this corresponds to divorce being
mentioned in 5.0% of all 35,932 women’s biogra-
phies, and 1.4% of all 206,926 men’s; on average,
a woman’s biography is 3.66 times more likely to
mention divorce than a man’s.
We repeat the gender proportion experiment with
terms denoting marriage (married, marry, marries,
marrying and marriage) and find a similar trend: of
the 39,142 biographies where at least one of these
terms is mentioned, 23.6% belong to women; again,
in a two-tailed proportion test, this difference is sig-
nificant at p &lt; 0.0001. This corresponds to marriage
appearing in 25.7% of all women’s biographies, and
14.5% of men’s; a woman’s biography is 1.78 times
more likely to mention marriage than a man’s.

The analysis above represents one substantive result
that mining life events from biographical data makes
possible. To illustrate the range of other analyses
that this method can occasion, we briefly present two
other directions that can be pursued: investigating
correlations among event classes and the distribution
of event classes over historical time.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999302">
6.1 Correlations among events
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.943776466666667">
In our full model with a logistic normal prior over a
document’s set of events, correlations among latent
event classes are learned during inference. From the
covariance matrix Eη, we can directly read off cor-
relations among events; for other models (such as
those with a Dirichlet prior), we can infer correla-
tions using the posterior estimates for q.
Table 5 illustrates the event classes that have the
highest correlations to the event class defined by
family, boss, murder, crime, mafia, became, ar-
rested, john, gang, chicago. The structure that we
learn here neatly corresponds to a CRIMINAL AC-
TION frame, with common events for KILLING, BE-
ING SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATION, BE-
ING ARRESTED and BEING BROUGHT TO TRIAL.

time for a set of learned event classes. While the
only notion of time that our model has access to

density plot of their observed absolute dates. Sev-

Grounding specific life events in history has the po-

the influence of the general passage of time, as on
transitions to adulthood (Modell et al., 1976; Hogan,
1981; Modell, 1980), and the influence of specific
historical moments like the Great Depression (Elder,
1974) or World War II (Mayer, 1988; Elder, 1991).

<bodyText confidence="0.999740642857143">
In learning general classes of events from text, our
work draws on a rich background spanning several
research traditions. By considering the structure that
exists between event classes, we draw on the origi-
nal work on procedural scripts and schemas (Min-
sky, 1974; Schank and Abelson, 1977) and narra-
tive chains (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Cham-
bers and Jurafsky, 2009), including more recent ad-
vances in the unsupervised learning of frame seman-
tic representations (Modi et al., 2012; O’Connor,
2013; Cheung et al., 2013; Chambers, 2013).
In learning latent classes from text, our work is
also clearly related to research on topic modeling
(Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
This work differs from that tradition by scoping
our data only over text that we have reason to be-
lieve describes events (by including absolute dates).
While other topic models have leveraged temporal
information in the learning of latent topics, such as
the dynamic topic model (Blei and Lafferty, 2006b;
Wang et al., 2012) and “topics over time” (Wang
and McCallum, 2006), our model is the first to in-
fer classes of events whose contours are shaped by
the time in a person’s life that they take place.
While the information extraction tasks of template
filling (Hobbs et al., 1993) and relation detection
(Banko et al., 2007; Fader et al., 2011; Carlson et al.,
2010) generally fall into a paradigm of classifying
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999974471698113">
text segments into a predetermined ontology, they
too have been informed by unsupervised approaches
to learning relation classes (Yao et al., 2011) and
events (Ritter et al., 2012). Our work here differs
from this past work in leveraging explicit absolute
temporal information in the unsupervised learning
of event classes (and their structure). Reasoning
about the temporal ordering of events likewise has a
long tradition of its own, both in NLP (Pustejovsky
et al., 2003; Mani et al., 2006; Verhagen et al., 2007;
Chambers et al., 2007) and information extraction
(Talukdar et al., 2012). Rather than attempting to
model the ordering of events relative to each other,
we focus instead on their occurrence relative to the
beginning of a person’s life.
Wikipedia likewise has been used extensively in
NLP; Wikipedia biographies in particular have been
used for the task of training summarization models
(Biadsy et al., 2008), recognizing biographical sen-
tences (Conway, 2010), learning correlates of “suc-
cess” (Ng, 2012), and disambiguating named enti-
ties (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007).
In our work in mining biographical structure from
it, we draw on previous research into automatically
uncovering latent structure in resum´es (Mimno and
McCallum, 2007a) and approaches to learning life
path trajectories from categorical survey data (Mas-
soni et al., 2009; Ritschard et al., 2013).
In using Wikipedia as a dataset for analysis, we
must note that the subjects of biographies are not a
representative sample of the population, nor are their
contents unbiased representations. Nearly all ency-
clopedias necessarily prefer the historically notori-
ous (if due to nothing else than inherent biases in the
preservation of historical records); many, like Wiki-
pedia, also have disproportionately low coverage of
women, minorities, and other demographic groups,
in part because of biases in community member-
ship. Estimates of the percentage of female edi-
tors on Wikipedia, for example, ranges from 9% to
16.1% (Collier and Bear, 2012; Reagle and Rhue,
2011; Cassell, 2011; Hill and Shaw, 2013; Wiki-
pedia, 2011). Different language editions of Wiki-
pedia have a natural geographic bias in article se-
lection (Hecht and Gergle, 2009), with each empha-
sizing their own “local heroes” (Kolbitsch and Mau-
rer, 2006), and also differ in the kind of information
they present (Pfeil et al., 2006; Callahan and Her-
ring, 2011). This extends to selection of biographies
as well, with one study finding approximately 16%
of 1000 sampled biographies being those of women
(Reagle and Rhue, 2011), a figure very close to the
14.8% we observe in our analysis here.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991878787879">
We present a method for mining life events from
biographies, leveraging the correlation structure of
event descriptions. Unlike prior work that has fo-
cused on inferring “life trajectories” from categor-
ical survey data, we learn relevant structure in an
unsupervised manner directly from text, opening the
door to applying this method to a broad set of biogra-
phies beyond Wikipedia (including full-text books
from the Internet Archive or Hathi Trust, and other
encyclopedic biographies as well). In a quantitative
analysis, the model we present outperforms a strong
baseline at the task of event time prediction, and sur-
faces a substantive qualitative distinction in the con-
tent of the biographies of men and women on Wiki-
pedia: in contrast to previous work that uses com-
putational methods to measure a difference in cov-
erage, we show that such methods are able to tease
apart differences in characterization as well.
While the task of event time prediction provides
a quantitative means to compare different models,
we expect the real application of this work will lie
in the latent event classes themselves, and the in-
formation they provide both about the subjects and
authors of biographies. Latent topics have provided
one way of organizing large document collections
in the past (Mimno and McCallum, 2007b); in ad-
dition to occasioning data analysis of the kind we
describe here, we expect that personal event classes
can have a practical application in helping to orga-
nize data describing people as well. Data and code
to support this work, including an interface to ex-
plore event classes in Wikipedia, can be found at

<abstract confidence="0.999521846153846">We present a method for discovering abstract event classes in biographies, based on a probabilistic latent-variable model. Taking as input timestamped text, we exploit latent correlations among events to learn a set of event (such as and along with the typical times in a person’s life when those events occur. In a quantitative evaluation at the task of predicting a person’s age for a given event, we find that our generative model outperforms a strong linear regression baseline, along with simpler variants of the model that ablate some features. The abstract event classes that we learn allow us to perform a large-scale analysis of 242,970 Wikipedia biographies. Though it is known that women are greatly underrepresented on Wikipedia—not only as editors (Wikipedia, 2011) but also as subjects of articles (Reagle and Rhue, 2011)—we find that there is a bias their well, with biographies of women containing significantly more emphasis on events of marriage and divorce than biographies of men.</abstract>

This results in a set of 927,403 biographies. For each biography, we perform part-of-speech tagging using the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) and named entity recognition using the Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005), cluster all mentions of co-referring proper names (Davis et al., 2003; Elson et al., 2010) and resolve pronominal co-reference (Bamman et al., 2014), aided by gender inference for each entity as the gender corresponding to the maximum number of gendered pronouns (i.e., he and she) mentioned in the article, as also used by Reagle and Rhue (2011). In a random test set of 500 articles, this method of gender inference is overwhelmingly accurate, achieving 100% precision with 97.6% recall (12 articles had no pronominal mentions and so gender is not assigned). 1http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/ 20140102/enwiki-20140102-pages-articles. xml.bz2 2“Persondata is a special set of metadata that can and should be added to biographical articles only” </context>

Estimates of the percentage of female editors on Wikipedia, for example, ranges from 9% to 16.1% (Collier and Bear, 2012; Reagle and Rhue, 2011; Cassell, 2011; Hill and Shaw, 2013; Wikipedia, 2011). Different language editions of Wikipedia have a natural geographic bias in article selection (Hecht and Gergle, 2009), with each emphasizing their own “local heroes” (Kolbitsch and Maurer, 2006), and also differ in the kind of information they present (Pfeil et al., 2006; Callahan and Herring, 2011). This extends to selection of biographies as well, with one study finding approximately 16% of 1000 sampled biographies being those of women (Reagle and Rhue, 2011), a figure very close to the 14.8% we observe in our analysis here. 8 Conclusion We present a method for mining life events from biographies, leveraging the correlation structure of event descriptions.

While the information extraction tasks of template filling (Hobbs et al., 1993) and relation detection (Banko et al., 2007; Fader et al., 2011; Carlson et al., 2010) generally fall into a paradigm of classifying 371 text segments into a predetermined ontology, they too have been informed by unsupervised approaches to learning relation classes (Yao et al., 2011) and events (Ritter et al., 2012).

Nearly all encyclopedias necessarily prefer the historically notorious (if due to nothing else than inherent biases in the preservation of historical records); many, like Wikipedia, also have disproportionately low coverage of women, minorities, and other demographic groups, in part because of biases in community membership. Estimates of the percentage of female editors on Wikipedia, for example, ranges from 9% to 16.1% (Collier and Bear, 2012; Reagle and Rhue, 2011; Cassell, 2011; Hill and Shaw, 2013; Wikipedia, 2011). Different language editions of Wikipedia have a natural geographic bias in article selection (Hecht and Gergle, 2009), with each emphasizing their own “local heroes” (Kolbitsch and Maurer, 2006), and also differ in the kind of information they present (Pfeil et al., 2006; Callahan and Herring, 2011). This extends to selection of biographies as well, with one study finding approximately 16% of 1000 sampled biographies being those of women (Reagle and Rhue, 2011), a figure very close to the 14.8% we observe in our analysis here. 8 Conclusion We present a </context>

Social scientists have long been interested in the structure of these events in investigating the role that individual agency and larger social forces play in shaping the course of an individual’s life. Life stages marking “transitions to adulthood” (such as LEAVING SCHOOL, ENTERING THE WORKFORCE and MARRIAGE) have important correlates with demographic variables (Modell et al., 1976; Hogan and Astone, 1986; Shanahan, 2000); and researchers study the interactional effects that life events have on each other, such as the relationship between divorce and pre-marital cohabitation (Lillard et al., 1995; Reinhold, 2010) or having children (Lillard and Waite, 1993).

One advantage of an unsupervised approach is that we eliminate the need to define a pre-determined set of event classes a priori, allowing application across a variety of different domains and time periods, such as full-text books from the Internet Archive or Hathi Trust, or historical works like the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Matthew and Harrison, 2004). Figure 1a illustrates the graphical form of our hierarchical Bayesian model, which articulates the relationship between an entity’s set of events (where each event is an observation defined as the bag of terms in text and the difference between the year it was recorded as happening and the birth year), an abstract set of event classes, correlations among those abstract classes, and the distribution of vocabulary terms that defines each one. To capture correlations among different classes, we place a logistic normal prior on each biography’s distribution over event classes (Blei and Lafferty,</context>

To capture correlations among different classes, we place a logistic normal prior on each biography’s distribution over event classes (Blei and Lafferty, 2006a; Blei and Lafferty, 2007; Mimno et al., 2008); unlike a Dirichlet, a logistic normal is able to capture arbitrary correlations between elements through the structure of the covariance matrix of its underlying multivariate normal. We take a Bayesian approach to estimating the mean µη and covariance Eη, drawing them from a conjugate Normal-Inverse Wishart prior. The generative story for the model runs as follows: let K be the number of latent event classes, P be the number of biographies, and Ep be the number of events in biography p. • Draw event class means and covariances µη E RK, Eη E RK×K — Normal-Inverse Wishart(µ0, A, Ψ, v) • For ea</context>

Social scientists have long been interested in the structure of these events in investigating the role that individual agency and larger social forces play in shaping the course of an individual’s life. Life stages marking “transitions to adulthood” (such as LEAVING SCHOOL, ENTERING THE WORKFORCE and MARRIAGE) have important correlates with demographic variables (Modell et al., 1976; Hogan and Astone, 1986; Shanahan, 2000); and researchers study the interactional effects that life events have on each other, such as the relationship between divorce and pre-marital cohabitation (Lillard et al., 1995; Reinhold, 2010) or having children (Lillard and Waite, 1993). The data on which these studies draw, however, has largely been restricted to categorical surveys and observational data; we present here a latentvariable model that exploits the correlations of event descriptions in text to learn the structure of abstract events, grounded in time, from text alone.

Nearly all encyclopedias necessarily prefer the historically notorious (if due to nothing else than inherent biases in the preservation of historical records); many, like Wikipedia, also have disproportionately low coverage of women, minorities, and other demographic groups, in part because of biases in community membership. Estimates of the percentage of female editors on Wikipedia, for example, ranges from 9% to 16.1% (Collier and Bear, 2012; Reagle and Rhue, 2011; Cassell, 2011; Hill and Shaw, 2013; Wikipedia, 2011).

By considering the structure that exists between event classes, we draw on the original work on procedural scripts and schemas (Minsky, 1974; Schank and Abelson, 1977) and narrative chains (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009), including more recent advances in the unsupervised learning of frame semantic representations (Modi et al., 2012; O’Connor, 2013; Cheung et al., 2013; Chambers, 2013). In learning latent classes from text, our work is also clearly related to research on topic modeling (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).

Our work here differs from this past work in leveraging explicit absolute temporal information in the unsupervised learning of event classes (and their structure). Reasoning about the temporal ordering of events likewise has a long tradition of its own, both in NLP (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Mani et al., 2006; Verhagen et al., 2007; Chambers et al., 2007) and information extraction (Talukdar et al., 2012). Rather than attempting to model the ordering of events relative to each other, we focus instead on their occurrence relative to the beginning of a person’s</context>

<bodyText confidence="0.9998193">
This paper deals with morphosemantic rela-
tions between Croatian verbs and discusses
their inclusion in Croatian WordNet. Mor-
phosemantic relations refer to semantic rela-
tions between morphologically related verbs,
i.e., between verbs from the same derivational
family. A derivational family consists of verbs
with the same lexical morpheme grouped
around a base form. Generally, a verb with the
simplest morphological structure serves as a
base form for derivational processes. In Croa-
tian, verbs are derived from base forms
through prefixation and suffixation. Both deri-
vational processes trigger aspectual and se-
mantic changes. The focus is on semantic rela-
tions that regularly appear in various deriva-
tional families and consequently in various
semantic fields. It is argued that these mor-
phosemantic relations are crucial for the fur-
ther development of Croatian WordNet.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875677419354">
Croatian WordNet is a lexical database built
through the so-called expand model (Vossen,
1998), i.e., by translating and adapting synsets
from Princeton WordNet (further PWI) into
Croatian. The building of Croatian WordNet
(CroWI) can roughly be divided into two major
phases. The first phase consisted of the transla-
tion and adaptation of the so-called basic concept
sets from the multilingual projects EuroWordNet
(EWI) and BalkaNet (BI) (cf. (Raffaelli et al.,
2008). At present, CroWN contains 10,000
synsets. 8500 of these are from the basic concept
sets of EWN and BN. Each synset was manually
translated and provided with meaning definitions
and usage examples. Synsets contain lexical
units of the same part of speech. Since CroWN is
a relatively small resource, the second phase of
the project is primarily oriented toward its en-
largement. Approximately 1500 noun synsets
were added using the same procedure. This
freely available version of CroWN contains 7391
noun synsets, 2318 verb synsets, and 310 adjec-
tive synsets.1 As the numbers indicate, nouns
make up almost 75% of the whole lexicon.2 Such
a strong predominance of this part of speech was
a motivation to make CroWN a more balanced
and representative resource for Croatian. The
second phase of the project is primarily focused
on enlarging the number of verbal synsets. How-
ever, this task required a re-examination of the
building strategy applied so far.

2 Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999209375">
We decided to re-examine our building strategy
for two reasons. The first pertains to differences
between English and Croatian verbs that are
more significant than was assumed. The second
reason is an attempt to speed up the building of
CroWN by using other available language re-
sources for Croatian. As far as the first reason is
concerned, the lexical hierarchies and word sens-
es from PWN in numerous cases differ signifi-
cantly from the lexical meaning, number of sens-
es, and sense relations in their Croatian counter-
parts. For example, the verb dati appears in 28
synsets in CroWN (i.e. it is marked for 28 sens-
es), but such a particularization of meaning is a
consequence of the adopted expand model, and
does not reflect its true semantic structure. Alt-

<bodyText confidence="0.999883818181818">
hough dati is a highly polysemous verb in Croa-
tian, we found only 12 different senses of this
verb listed in various monolingual dictionaries.3
Apart from issues concerning conceptual systems
and semantic representation, rich derivational
processes between Croatian verbs bring about
relations that cannot be captured by presently
used semantic relations.4 Verbs in Croatian are
derived from other verbs by prefixation and suf-
fixation. Both processes can trigger a change in
aspect and the addition of a new semantic com-
ponent to the base form. In accordance with
Binnick (1991), we treat aspect as a grammatical
feature, but predictable shifts in meaning, fre-
quently referred to as Aktionsarten, as lexical
features, pertaining to classes of verbs. This dis-
tinction is reflected in the structure of verbal
synsets in CroWN. True aspectual pairs, i.e., im-
perfectives and perfectives denoting completion
of an action, are members of the same synset.
The lexical meaning of these perfectives differs
from imperfectives only in this temporal distinc-
tion. Apart from aspectual change, semantic
components brought by affixes can produce
combinations that, in terms of meaning, can vary
from compositional to completely idiosyncratic.
E.g., the verb crtati ‘to drawipf’ has a true aspec-
tual pair nacrtati ‘to drawpf’, but there are six
other prefixed perfectives as well: 1. pre+crtati
‘to copy (by drawing)pf’, 2. pod+crtati ‘to under-
linepf’, 3. o+crtati ‘to outlinepf’, 4. is+crtati ‘to
draw completelypf’, 5. u+crtati ‘to draw intopf’,
and 6. za+crtati ‘to make a planpf’. The same
prefixes can be used with other base forms, e.g.
pre+pisati ‘to copy (by writing)pf’, pre+slikati
‘to copy (by painting)pf. The base form crtati ‘to
drawipf’ can also be suffixed, e.g. 1. crt-k-ati ‘to
drawipf, diminutive’, 2. crt-kar-ati ‘to drawipf,
pejorative’.5 Suffixes with diminutive and pejo-
rative meanings can also combine with other
base forms. We pose two basic questions: Which
semantic regularities can be spotted in combina-
tions of particular affixes and various base
forms? and How can thereby established mor-

3 More examples can be found in Šojat et al. (2012:
111 – 112).
4 We use the same semantic relations between verbal
synsets as in EWN and BN. These relations are syn-
onymy, hyponymy/hypernymy, antonymy, cause, and
subevent.
5 Suffixes -k- and -kar- occupy the first position on

phosemantic relations be used in our further
work? In order to address these issues, as well as
to speed up the building of CroWN, we have de-
cided to use data from CroDeriV, a large mor-
phological database of Croatian verbs. In the fol-
lowing section we shall briefly describe this re-
source (for a full description, see Šojat et al.,
2012).

CroDeriV is a computational lexicon containing
data on the morphological structure of approxi-
mately 14 300 Croatian verbs collected from
freely available dictionaries and corpora. The
compiled verbal lemmas were analyzed for mor-
phemes with a rule-based approach and the re-
sults were checked manually. Each lexical entry
in CroDeriV consists of verbs decomposed into
morphemes and linguistic metadata. The struc-
ture for all analyzed verbs consists of 11 mor-
pheme slots and covers all combinations of rec-
orded lexical and grammatical morphemes.
There are four types of slots for morphemes: (1)
derivational prefixes (four slots), (2) the lexical
part (three slots – in the majority of cases only
one is filled, the three slots are provided for ver-
bal compounds of two roots and an interfix), (3)
derivational and conjugational suffixes (three
slots), and (4) infinitive ending (one slot). The
metadata in lexical entries indicate verbal aspect
and types of reflexivity.6 The database enables
queries across the full derivational span of a par-
ticular base form and provides extensive data
about the distribution and frequency of affixes in
the derivation of Croatian verbs.7 In the follow-
ing section, the underlying analysis of affixal
meanings is described.

All 19 verbal prefixes recorded in CroDeriV
were analyzed in the same manner.8 This analy-
sis enabled the recognition of the same or similar
semantic components shared by different prefix-
es as well as the division of prefixal meanings
into four major semantic groups. The four major
groups of prefixal meanings are location, time,
quantity, and manner. Each group has several
subgroups. An analysis of suffixal meanings
yielded an additional semantic group of diminu-
tive and pejorative verbs.9 Before further discus-
sion, we shall briefly present the morphoseman-
tic relations between verbs in other Slavic word-
nets and compare them with the relations used in

Czech, Bulgarian, and Serbian wordnets are dis-
cussed in Pala and Hlaváčková (2007), Koeva
(2008), and Koeva et al. (2008). The discussion
refers mainly to derivational relations across dif-
ferent parts of speech. Pala and Hlaváčková
(2007) list 14 derivational processes in Czech
introduced into Czech WordNet as relations be-
tween derived and base forms. This results in a
“two-level network”, where the higher level in-
cludes semantic relations between synsets, and
the lower level includes derivational relations
between single synset members. Although the
verb-verb pairs are linked through prefixation,
this relation is not used in further analysis.
Koeva (2008) points out the relation between
verbal aspectual pairs as the most productive der-
ivational relation in Bulgarian and argues that
perfective and imperfective verbs in Bulgarian
WordNet should be split into separate synsets.
While the hypernymy would be based on imper-
fective verbs only, synsets would be linked with
the morphosemantic relation aspect. Relations
between prefixed derivatives and base forms,
apart from aspectual, are not discussed. The
work presented in Koeva et al. (2008) concerning
Serbian WordNet refers mainly to derivational
relations across different parts of speech. Aspec-
tual pairs in Serbian WordNet are members of
the same synset. The most elaborate account of
relations between verbs in Slavic is given in Ma-
ziarz et al. (2011) and Maziarz et al. (2012). In
Polish WordNet 2.0 aspectual pairs are kept apart
and lexical hierarchies consist of either perfec-
tive or imperfective verbs. Relations between
verbs are divided into purely semantic relations
(e.g., synonymy, hyponymy, meronymy holon-
ymy, antonymy, processuality, causality, inchoa-
tivity, presupposition, and preceding) and deriva-
tionally-motivated relations (e.g., pure aspectual-
ity, secondary aspectuality, iterativity, and deri-
vationality). Some of the relations hold between
lexical units (word-sense pairs, e.g., antonymy or
pure aspectuality), while others hold between
synsets (e.g., hyponymy and processuality). In
CroWN, pure aspectual pairs are members of the
same synset. Pure aspectual pairs are determined
primarily by the test of secondary imperfectiviza-
tion (cf. Jelaska, 2005; Maziarz et al., 2011), but
also by additional criteria pertaining to semantics
of affixes. The relation of pure aspectuality exists
between a base form and a derivative with an
affix which does not contain any other semantic
components except perfectiveness, e.g. pisati ‘to
writeipf’ – napisati ‘to writepf’ are members of the
same synset. The same holds for iterative verbs
and perfective base forms. Although iterative
verbs have the additional semantic component of
repetitiveness, they differ from their perfectives
only in this temporal component. E.g., pisati ‘to
writeipf’ – prepisati ‘to copy by writingpf’ are not
members of the same synset. However, prepisati
‘to copy by writingpf’ – prepisivati ‘to copy by
writingipf-iter’ are members of the same synset.
Each synset member is tagged with one of the
following aspect labels: IPF, PF, BI, or ITER,
representing imperfective, perfective, bi-
aspectual and iterative forms. This distinction is
also reflected in different aspectual forms used in
definitions, although they are structurally and
semantically the same. Finally, all mor-
phosemantic relations in CroWN discussed be-
low hold between single members of synsets, i.e.
lexical units, and not between whole synsets.

6 Morphosemantic Relations in CroWI
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999883818181818">
Morphosemantic relations are based on overlap-
ping components of affixal meanings in combi-
nations with various base forms. The analysis
described in Section 4 enabled the classification
of affixal meanings into four broad semantic
groups for prefixes and one for suffixes. Four
major groups for prefixes – location, time, quan-
tity, and manner – are further divided into sub-
groups (28 in total). Morphosemantic relations
and a variety of sub-relations based upon this
classification are listed below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.96541475">
1. PREFIXES:
a) location group: bottom-up, top-down,
proximity, through, apart, to/towards,
over, into, around, under, re-location,
behind, across, from
b) time group: inchoativity, finitiveness,
distributivity, preceding
c) quantity group: sufficiency (+/-), ex-
cessiveness, intensity (+/-), exceeding,
deprivation, addition
d) manner group: inter-connection, change
of property.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990803453125">
SUFFIXES:
a) diminutive group: diminutive, pejora-
tive
As far as the semantic impact of prefixes is con-
cerned, relations in the location group predomi-
nantly hold between verbs of movement, but also
between numerous other base verbs and deriva-
tives with spatial relations pervading their lexical
meaning (e.g., udahnuti &apos;to inhale&apos; or uvući &apos;to
drag into&apos;). Derivatives in time group refer to dif-
ferent phases of actions denoted by base verbs
(e.g., beginning or termination). The subtype dis-
tributivity is on the border between the time and
quantity groups since the derivatives denote re-
petitive actions performed by one or more agents
on one or more objects. Since distributive actions
are performed iteratively, this relation is listed in
the time group. Relations from the quantity group
hold when derivatives denote various degrees of
an action (e.g. naraditi se &apos;to tire oneself out
(with work)&apos;, najesti se &apos;to eat one’s fill&apos;). The
smallest group – manner – contains only two
relations denoting changes of properties (e.g.,
uprljati se &apos;to become dirty&apos;) and actions per-
formed in a specific manner (e.g. sufinancirati &apos;to
co-finance&apos;). The semantic impact of suffixes is
limited to diminutive and pejorative meaning
expressed by derivatives (e.g., jeduckati &apos;to nib-
ble&apos;). The aim of this classification is to establish
the set of morphosemantic relations and use them
within derivational families of verbs in CroWN.
To determine which verbs are derivationally re-
lated and therefore are candidates for further
analysis, we compared the list of verbs from
CroWN and CroDeriV. All verbs from the 2318
verbal synsets in CroWN are recorded in Cro-
DeriV.
The full list of verbs from CroWN was filtered
into those sharing the same root. The list of verbs
recognized as derivatives comprises 2530 base
forms and prefixed derivatives. This list was fur-
ther filtered for verbs marked as aspectual pairs
in CroWN. In the next step, prefixed forms were
segmented into prefixes and base forms. Thus we
obtained 572 base forms and 1476 derivatives as
candidates for the assignment of morphoseman-
tic relations. In the final step, the relations were
manually assigned to derivationally related verbs
from CroWN. When no morphosemantic relation
was appropriate due to the idiosyncratic nature of
the combinations, we tagged this relation as
DERIV (144 verbs).
The result of the whole procedure is a list of 572
base forms and 1186 prefixed verbs marked for
morphosemantic relations. There are also 19 lex-
ical units marked as diminutives in CroWN. In
CroDeriV, derivational suffixes for diminutives
always occupy the first slot to the right of the
root (cf. Section 3). Table 1 contains the overall
frequency of relations in four major groups as
well as the frequency of the three most promi-
nent subrelations for prefixed derivatives (man-
ner contains only two subrelations). The last row
indicates the frequency of suffixed derivatives.

None of the discussed morphosemantic relations
between members of different synsets can be
completely subsumed by any of semantic rela-
tions between synsets in terms of semantic con-
tent. Base verbs and their derivatives are fre-
quently not members of same lexical hierarchies,
such as synsets containing derivationally related
verbs like ići &apos;to go&apos;, ući &apos;to go into&apos;, izaći &apos;to go
out&apos; and otići &apos;to go away&apos;. Although the verbs ući
and izaći are marked as antonyms, the related-
ness of the whole group is not indicated. The
relation cause partially overlaps with our mor-
phosemantic relation change of property, but
cause cannot encompass reflexive non-agentive
counterpart pairs of transitive verbs in Slavic
(e.g. topiti se – otopiti se ’to meltipf-pf&apos;’ – to be-
come soft or liquid vs. topiti – otopiti ’to meltipf-
pf&apos; – to cause to become soft or liquid. The rela-
tion of subevent refers to two simultaneous ac-
tions or to an action which is a part of the action
denoted by another synset, but it does not reflect
particular parts of events, such as its beginning
or terminating point, as morphosemantic rela-
tions of inchoativity or finitiveness do. In order
to capture the semantic relatedness between
verbs usually scattered across different hierar-
chies, we have introduced a set of 28 mor-
phosemantic relations. This &amp;quot;two-level network,&amp;quot;
as defined by Pala and Hlaváčková (2007), along
with extensive data from CroDeriV, provides an
excellent basis for further work. Although Cro-
DeriV does not contain data about lexical mean-
ing and semantic relations between verbs, infor-
mation about the morphological structure of
verbs proved valuable for the detection of deriva-
tionally related verbs and the assignment of mor-
phosemanic relations. Information about com-
plete derivational families is also valuable for the
further expansion of CroWN, which is one of our
primary goals. It can be used both to complete
already present derivational families and to in-
troduce new ones. Finally, the importance of
morphosemantic relations in the description of
the verbal system in Croatian can be demonstrat-
ed with the Croatian verb gristi &apos;to biteipf&apos;. This
verb appears in CroWN only in this form,
whereas CroDeriV contains ten other derivatives
from this base form. Only the derivative marked
with the relation DERIVED in Figure 1 below
can be straightforwardly connected to other
synsets in CroWN via semantic relations. All
other derivatives, i.e., 90% of this derivational
family, should be connected to this base form
primarily by morphosemantic relations as de-
scribed here. Although the full set of mor-
phosemantic relations as discussed here provides
a more densed and fine-grained structure of the
Croatian lexicon, we are aware that in numerous
cases it is hard to maintain the consistency and
clear-cut distinctions among 28 presented rela-
tions. However, we are convinced that even a set
of morphosemantic relations limited to four ma-
jor groups of prefixed derivatives (location, time,
quantity and manner) and one group of suffixed
derivatives (diminutive/pejorative) can substan-
tially enrich wordnets for Slavic languages.

<abstract confidence="0.994137238095238">This paper deals with morphosemantic relations between Croatian verbs and discusses their inclusion in Croatian WordNet. Morphosemantic relations refer to semantic relations between morphologically related verbs, i.e., between verbs from the same derivational family. A derivational family consists of verbs with the same lexical morpheme grouped around a base form. Generally, a verb with the simplest morphological structure serves as a base form for derivational processes. In Croatian, verbs are derived from base forms through prefixation and suffixation. Both derivational processes trigger aspectual and semantic changes. The focus is on semantic relations that regularly appear in various derivational families and consequently in various semantic fields. It is argued that these morphosemantic relations are crucial for the further development of Croatian WordNet.</abstract>

Both processes can trigger a change in aspect and the addition of a new semantic component to the base form. In accordance with Binnick (1991), we treat aspect as a grammatical feature, but predictable shifts in meaning, frequently referred to as Aktionsarten, as lexical features, pertaining to classes of verbs. This distinction is reflected in the structure of verbal synsets in CroWN. True aspectual pairs, i.e., imperfectives and perfectives denoting completion of an action, are members of the same synset. The lexical meaning of these perfectives differs from imperfectives only in this temporal distinction. Apart from aspectual change, semantic components brought by affixes can produce combinations that, in terms of meaning, can va</context>

Some of the relations hold between lexical units (word-sense pairs, e.g., antonymy or pure aspectuality), while others hold between synsets (e.g., hyponymy and processuality). In CroWN, pure aspectual pairs are members of the same synset. Pure aspectual pairs are determined primarily by the test of secondary imperfectivization (cf. Jelaska, 2005; Maziarz et al., 2011), but also by additional criteria pertaining to semantics of affixes. The relation of pure aspectuality exists between a base form and a derivative with an affix which does not contain any other semantic components except perfectiveness, e.g. pisati ‘to writeipf’ – napisati ‘to writepf’ are members of the same synset. The same holds for iterative verbs and perfective base forms. Although iterative verbs have the additional semantic component of repetitiveness, they differ from their perfectives only in this temporal component. E.g., pisati ‘to writeipf’ – prepisati ‘to c</context>

The relation of subevent refers to two simultaneous actions or to an action which is a part of the action denoted by another synset, but it does not reflect particular parts of events, such as its beginning or terminating point, as morphosemantic relations of inchoativity or finitiveness do. In order to capture the semantic relatedness between verbs usually scattered across different hierarchies, we have introduced a set of 28 morphosemantic relations. This &amp;quot;two-level network,&amp;quot; as defined by Pala and Hlaváčková (2007), along with extensive data from CroDeriV, provides an excellent basis for further work. Although CroDeriV does not contain data about lexical meaning and semantic relations between verbs, information about the morphological structure of verbs proved valuable for the detection of derivationally related verbs and the assignment of morphosemanic relations. Information about complete derivational families is also valuable for the further expansion of CroWN, which is one of our primary goals. It can be used both to complete already present derivational families and to introduce new ones. Finally, </context>

This paper elucidates the InterlinguaPlus
design and its application in bi-directional text
translations between Ekegusii and Kiswahili
languages unlike the traditional translation
pairs, one-by-one. Therefore, any of the
languages can be the source or target language.
The first section is an overview of the project,
which is followed by a brief review of
Machine Translation. The next section
discusses the implementation of the system
using Carabao’s open machine translation
framework and the results obtained. So far, the
translation results have been plausible
particularly for the resource-scarce local
languages and clearly affirm morphological
similarities inherent in Bantu languages.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998832">
Development of language applications for
local languages in Africa requires innovative
approaches since many of these languages are
resource scarce. By this we mean that electronic
language resources such as digital corpora,
electronic dictionaries, spell checkers,
annotators, and parsers are hardly available.
These languages are also predominately spoken
rather than written. Moreover, they are generally
used in environments where there are other
competing languages like English and French
which have been well documented over the years
with properly defined grammars, unlike the local
languages with poorly defined grammars and
dictionaries. This has been a major setback in the
development of technologies for African
languages. The presence of diacritics in most of
these languages has also contributed to the
complexity involved in the development of
language technology applications. (Ombui &amp;
Wagacha, 2007).
Nevertheless, there is pioneering work with
the South African languages, which includes the
definition of proper language grammars and
development of a national language policy
framework to encourage the utilization of the
indigenous languages as official languages
(NLPF, 2003).
In this paper, we consider two Bantu
languages in Kenya namely Ekegusii and
Swahili. There are approximately two million
Ekegusii language speakers (KNBS, 2009).
Swahili is widely spoken in East and Central
Africa and is one of the official languages of the
African Union with lots of printed resources.
For the work that we are reporting, we have
adopted the InterlinguaPlus approach using the
Carabao open machine translation framework
(Berman, 2012). In this approach, all similar
meaning words, synonyms, from each language
and across the languages existing in the system
are stored under the same category and assigned
an identical family number. These words are also
tagged with numbered lexical information1. For
example, Egetabu (a book) [1=N; 2=SG; 5=No].
Tag1 stands for the part of speech (1-POS),
Noun, tag2 for number (2-No.), Singular, and
tag5 indicates whether the noun is animate or
inanimate etc. An amalgamation of the word’s
family identification number and tag numbers
form a unique ID for the word. In addition, a
novel way of only storing the base forms of each
word and having a different table containing
affixes that inflect the word drastically reduces
the lexical database size and development time in
general. This approach is implemented through
the manual encoding of the sequence rules for
the two languages.
Preliminary results are encouraging and
clearly reveal similarities in the language
structure of Ekegusii and Swahili. The advantage
of this approach is that the translation is
bidirectional and maintains the semantic
approach to translation just as a human
translator. In addition, it is suitable for rapid
generation of domain specific translations for
under-resourced languages.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984861111111">
Over the history of MT, several techniques and
approaches have continued to be developed
despite previous discouraging reports (ALPAC,
1966). The major approaches and methodologies
include: Rule-based and Corpus-based, Direct
translation and indirect translation (i.e. transfer-
based and Interlingua-based) (Hutchins, 1993 &amp;
Hutchins, 1994). With the introduction of
Artificial Intelligence technology in MT, more
recent approaches have been proposed including
alignment template approach to Statistical MT
(Och &amp; Ney, 2004), Knowledge-based approach
(Nirenburg et al., 1992), Human in loop, and
Hybrid methods (Groves &amp; Way, 2006).
One of the strengths of the InterlinguaPlus
approach (Berman, 2012) is that it preserves
semantic information of the lexicon. Therefore,
translation is primarily based on semantic
equivalents between the lexicons of these
languages.
As a result, the traditional language pair-based
translation is replaced by bidirectional
translations between the languages existing in the
system. Any language can be the source or a
target language.
Consequently, the lexical database size is
drastically reduced and the task of building
multiple dictionaries is concentrated in
constructing just one Interlingua lexical database.
This kind of approach is evidently advantageous
when building machine translation applications
for under-resourced African languages because it
expedites the process of adding a new language
with minimal effort especially when adding
languages of similar grammatical makeup, which
could reuse some of the existing grammar rules.

3. Implementation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998970806451613">
Figure 1 below illustrates the translation process
in the Ekegusii Machine Translation (EMT)
system. The user inputs a sentence, which is
parsed into its constituent tokens. These tokens
are then matched and mapped to their equivalent
target-language tokens using the Family and
mapping Identification numbers respectively. In
addition, the sequence2 e.g.
Subject+Verb+Object is parsed into elements
(lexical units) and authenticated against the
elements of the analyzed sentence. If it is valid,
the elements are mapped according to the
sequence and modified by the corresponding
2 Set of elements, which refer to tokens that have specified
features e.g. grammatical data, style, word-order, etc.
sequence in the target language. Some of the
features that can be modified include deleting or
adding a new element. E.g. He ate a
mango.[eng:SVO]. A+li+kula Embe . Note that
Swahili and generally the local African
languages do not have determiners. Therefore,
when translating from Eng-Swa, the English
determiner is dropped. However, it is added if
the translation is vice-versa. This is made
possible by assigning a locally unique identity
number, preserved across languages in the
database, to each lexical unit of a sequence. The
sequence manager in the system uses these
identity numbers to appropriately handle lexical
holes and the source/target of each
transformation.

The above process, MR-PDF3, is an acronym
for the five translation stages (explained below)
with the last two stages shifted at the beginning
so as to give it an easy-to-remember name. We
will use example 1, English to Ekegusii SVO
phrase to elucidate the process.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.345059">
Stage 3: Family word-match

<bodyText confidence="0.992950481481481">
Every morpheme is examined considering all
possible combination of affixes to it and each
configuration stored. These are then aligned with
the corresponding target language dictionary
entities.
[He]= [Ere]
[ate]= [ariete] Past form of eat=karia
[a]= [a] yields the same token if an equivalent is
not found in the target language.
[Mango]= [Riembe] Singular, noun.
All other delimiters, e.g. question marks (?),
comas (,) are presented as they appeared in the
source string. From the above example, all
possible modifiers of the verb “to eat” are
generated i.e. eat, ate, eaten, eats, eating, and
matched with the corresponding verb in Ekegusii
dictionary i.e. Karia, ariete, nkoria, etc.
The tricky part of it is that one may not
always have an equivalent number of modified
verbs in the target or source dictionaries. To
resolve this ambiguity, the program picks the
modified verb with the best match in the target
language dictionary i.e. in terms of matching
lexical or style information e.g. the type of tense,
number, animation, gender etc.
If we refer to the same example above, the
following is examined as shown in Table 1and

It is apparent that both dictionaries are used to
provide grammatical information, semantic data
and potential equivalents in the target language
during this stage.
Stage 4: Mapping
At the mapping stage, the Source text is
validated against all existing sequences trees in
the language. Only the most complete and
detailed tree is picked. From example 1 above,
the most appropriate sequence tree will be as
follows and illustrated in figure 2.
He ate a mango Ri-embe a-rie-te

<bodyText confidence="0.980321964285714">
The elements in the source sequence will map
exactly into the [N] + [V] sequence. At this point
all the redundant guesses are eliminated and
disambiguation occurs. There are more
comparisons and checks - like subject and style
checks, etc.
Stage 5: Apply Rules.
The elements in the source sequence are
modified by the corresponding sequence in the
target language. The affixes are attached, or
some new elements added or others completely
deleted. Each element’s unique identity is used to
map the source sequence to the equivalent target
sequence identities. Remember that Ekegusii
does not have determiners and therefore it is
dropped.
From the example above, the noun is then
modified by adding the singular prefix- ri, (noun
class 13) while the verb is modified by
concatenating the subject- a (singular pronoun)
to the verb- rie and finally adding the suffix- te
(Past tense). The final sentence then becomes as
shown below
Riembe ariete -&gt; ri-embe a-rie-te
In case it is converted to plural, the noun
prefix will change to- ama (noun class 6) and the
pronoun to- ba while maintaining the past tense
suffix- te

Finally, the sentence word order is rearranged
according to the best fitting sequence tree in the
target language sequence table.

4. Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959428571429">
The results gotten so far are plausible. The word
order is correct as per the programmed sequence
rules for each language e.g. English: This is a
book; Ekegusii. Eke n’egetabu; Kiswahili: Hiki
ni kitabu. In addition, the bidirectional
functionality is often more than 50% accurate on
the wider domains and about 90% accurate on
specific domains, in our case the obituary’s
domain. This evaluation is based on phrase level.
Besides, once a phrase text has been translated, it
can also be used as the source text and the
translator will yield the exact translation as the
initial source text. This therefore makes a strong
case for the high intelligibility of the system.
The idea of storing only the word base forms
and having a separate table for the affixes has
drastically reduced the lexical database size as
well as the building time. It was also noted that
there is need for careful configuration of the rule
units4 for the affixes and lexicon otherwise the
translation will be inaccurate. If we are to use the
example above, the canonical5 form will be as
follows: English: FID-144 Book [POS: N;
Number: SG; Animation: No]. However, for
Ekegusii, there is need for additional rules units
to indicate the noun class6 because the nouns
inflection is dependent on the noun class,
otherwise the machine translator might
concatenate the wrong prefix. Therefore, the
English example above will be matched as
follows. Ekegusii: FID-144 tabu [POS: N;
Animation: No, EkeNC7: 8/9].
Consequently, the translator compares the
rule units of the word with the rule units of the
modifiers8 in the affixes table and picks the most
matching affix, in this case the prefix “ege”
[POS: N; Number: SG; Animation: No,
EkeNC9:8/9], ensuing n accurate translated word
“egetabu”. On the contrary, if the Ekegusii rule
units were not added or wrongly configured, the
translation will be bizarre e.g. “Omotabu” which
is an invalid Ekegusii name. In fact, the prefix

speech, number contrast, gender, conjugation pattern, etc.
5 Base form of the word before any inflection

7 Ekegusii Noun Class
8 In this case, Prefixes
9 Ekegusii Noun Class
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.99725532">
“omo” [EkeNC: 1] is often reserved for singular
human10 nouns.
The results obtained also expound the
diversity of Ekegusii language linguistic rules11
as compared to English. Most Indo-European
languages, specifically English, espouse the
SVO12 sentence structure rule. However, in
Ekegusii both SVO and VOS rules are valid
sentence structure rules. For example, English:
Mum ate mangoes [SVO]. Ekegusii: 1.Omog’ina
nariete amaembe [SVOJ. 2. Nariete amaembe
Omong’ina [VOSJ. Interestingly, the Ekegusii
sequence and grammar rules that were copied
and pasted to Swahili with minimal alteration
resulted in almost precise translations between
the two languages. This inevitably affirms the
similarity in the language structure of the two
languages and the ease in defining, constructing
and translating between local languages as
compared to/or from English.
The project demonstrations made so far to
peers and students have generated a lot of
enthusiasm in African languages research and
given a good indication of the reception of
technology in a familiar language platform.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999970208333333">
The InterlinguaPlus approach is good
particularly for under-resourced languages in
terms of generating rapid translations that give a
good gist of the meaning in the second language.
Although it takes some time to write the
grammar rules for a new language at the
beginning, it however takes a relatively shorter
time when adding languages of similar
grammatical makeup. Therefore, the approach is
very feasible especially when considering under-
resourced languages which may not be afforded
the appropriate finances and sufficient political
will to have technological resources built for
them.
The lexical database building methodology,
whereby words and their grammatical data are
stored in respective families and assigned a
unique identification, provides an excellent way
of reducing the chances of ambiguity that may
exist in the phonetic disparities inherent in these
local languages.
The InterlinguaPlus approach employed in the
Carabao Open MT framework forms a good
foundation to scale existing language resources

In this paper, we consider two Bantu languages in Kenya namely Ekegusii and Swahili. There are approximately two million Ekegusii language speakers (KNBS, 2009). Swahili is widely spoken in East and Central Africa and is one of the official languages of the African Union with lots of printed resources. For the work that we are reporting, we have adopted the InterlinguaPlus approach using the Carabao open machine translation framework (Berman, 2012). In this approach, all similar meaning words, synonyms, from each language and across the languages existing in the system are stored under the same category and assigned an identical family number. These words are also tagged with numbered lexical information1. For example, Egetabu (a book) [1=N; 2=SG; 5=No]. Tag1 stands for the part of speech (1-POS), Noun, tag2 for number (2-No.), Singular, and tag5 indicates whether the noun is animate or inanimate etc. An amalgamation of the word’s family identification number and tag numbers form a unique ID for the word.

Contemporary efforts to document the world’s endangered languages—often going under the rubric
of documentary linguistics—are dependent on the widespread availability of modern recording
technologies, in particular digital audio and video recording devices and software to annotate the
recordings that such devices produce. However, despite well over a decade of dedicated funding efforts
aimed at the documentation of endangered languages, the technological landscape that supports the work
of those involved in this research remains fragmented, and the promises of new technology remain largely
unfulfilled. Moreover, the efforts of computer scientists, on the whole, are mostly disconnected from the
day-to-day work of documentary linguists, making it difficult for the knowledge of each group to inform
the other. On the one hand, this deprives documentary linguists of tools making use of the latest research
results to speed up the time-consuming task of describing an underdocumented language. On the other
hand, it severely limits the ability of computational linguists to test their methods on the full range of
world’s linguistic diversity.
Despite the concerns listed above, recent efforts do indicate that there is significant potential in
collaboration between computational linguists (and other computer scientists) and linguists working on
endangered languages. For instance, machine labeling and active learning can make the process of textual
analysis for low-resource languages more efficient, and state-of-the-art tools in grammar engineering
can be applied at a relatively low cost to new languages that are typologically divergent from those that
primarily informed their design. Moreover, new models of data collection based on the ubiquity of low-
cost, networkable devices with recording capabilities, such as smartphones, show the extent to which the
barriers to collecting significant amounts of primary data have fallen in recent years, and it has similarly
been found that the pairing of crowdsourcing and machine translation techniques can yield useful results
for low resource languages in a short time frame. Research along these latter lines, in particular, indicates
that computationally-driven advances in the documentation of the world’s languages may need to rely
as much on clever engineering and user interface solutions as on methods for processing language data
developed within computational linguistics proper, in a manner parallel to efforts in other domains that
have considered how new online services can be used to facilitate computational linguistic research.
A different set of activities within the documentary linguistics community involving the increasing use
of open standards for encoding language data is also significant in this regard. For instance, in the
last decade, standardized XML formats have become more widely used to encode text annotations and
lexical data. This facilitates the reuse of documentary materials. Even in the absence of the use of such
standards, significant results have been achieved in gathering structured data from materials placed on
the web. As more data becomes available in standardized forms, there will only be increased potential
for building new kinds of language resources.
The papers in these proceedings cover the full range of work at the intersection of computational
and endangered language linguistics. Some contributions come from scholars primarily identifying as
computer scientists who are exploring how tools developed in their areas of expertise can be applied
to endangered language research. Others derive from the work of individuals primarily identifying
as descriptive linguists who are reporting on the results of the application of new computational
methods to traditional language work. There is also a division among contributions which have more
practical orientations versus programmatic ones, with topics ranging from discussion of software under
development to high-level considerations of where our research priorities should lie.
We would like to thank those who made this workshop possible: the ACL staff, 2014 annual meeting
organizers, the program committee, workshop participants, and research assistant Daniel Fox. Further
support came from National Science Foundation Award Nos. BCS-1404352 and IIS-1027289.

This paper proposes a methodology for
generating specialized Japanese data sets
for the extraction of causal relations, in
which temporal, causal and discourse re-
lations at both the fact level and the epis-
temic level, are annotated. We applied
our methodology to a number of text frag-
ments taken from the Balanced Corpus of
Contemporary Written Japanese. We eval-
uated the feasibility of our methodology in
terms of agreement and frequencies, and
discussed the results of the analysis.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.948800964285715">
In recent years, considerable attention has been
paid to deep semantic processing. Many studies
(Betherd et al., 2008), (Inui et al., 2007), (Inui
et al., 2003), (Riaz and Girju, 2013) have been
recently conducted on deep semantic processing,
and causal relation extraction (CRE) is one of the
specific tasks in deep semantic processing. Re-
search on CRE is still developing and there are
many obstacles that must be overcome.
Inui et al. (2003) acquired cause and effect
pairs from text, where the antecedent events were
taken as causes and consequent events were taken
as effects based on Japanese keywords such as
kara and node. In (1), for example, the an-
tecedent ame-ga hutta (‘it rained’) and the conse-
quent mizutamari-ga dekita (‘puddles emerged’)
are acquired as a pair of cause and effect.
(1) Ame-ga hutta-node
rain-NOM fall-past-because
mizutamari-ga dekita.
puddles-NOM emerge-past
‘Because it rained, puddles emerged.’
However, antecedents are not always causes or
reasons for consequents in Japanese, as illustrated
by the following example.
(2) Zinsinziko-ga
injury.accident-NOM
okita-kara densya-ga
happen-past-because trains-NOM
tiensita to-iu-wake-dewanai.
delay-past it.is.not.the.case.that
‘It is not the case that the trains were
delayed because an injury accident hap-
pened.’
In example (2), the antecedent zinsinziko-ga okita
(‘an injury accident happened’) is not the cause
of the consequent densya-ga tiensita (‘the trains
were delayed’). Though in such sentences that
contain causal expressions there are no causal re-
lations between antecedents and consequents, in
existing studies each sentence containing a causal
expression was extracted as knowledge represent-
ing cause and effect, such as in (Inui et al., 2003).
It is difficult for computers to auto-recognize and
exclude such cases.
In this paper, we report on the analysis of nec-
essary information for acquiring more accurate
cause-effect knowledge and propose a methodol-
ogy for creating a Japanese corpus for CRE. First,
we introduce previous studies and describe infor-
mation that should be used to annotate data sets.
Next, we describe our methodology based on Seg-
mented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT)
(Asher et al., 2003). Finally, we evaluate the va-
lidity of our methodology in terms of agreement
and frequency, and analyze the results.

In this section, we introduce previous studies on
annotation of temporal, causal and other types of
relations and present a linguistic analysis of tem-

relations. In addition, these specialized data sets
were evaluated in terms of agreement and accu-
racy. Relations were classified into two causal cat-
egories (CAUSAL, NO-REL) and three temporal
categories (BEFORE, AFTER, NO-REL). In re-
gard to the evaluation, Betherd et al. pointed out
that the classification was coarse-grained, and that
reanalysis would have to be performed with more
fine-grained relations.
Inui et al. (2005) characterized causal expres-
sions in Japanese text and built Japanese corpus
with tagged causal relations. However, usages
such as that illustrated in (2) and interactions be-
tween temporal relations and causal relations were
not analyzed.
Tamura (2012) linguistically analyzed temporal
and causal relations and pointed out that in rea-
son/purpose constructions in Japanese, the event
time indicated by the tense sometimes contradicts
the actual event time, and that the information nec-
essary to recognize the order between events lies
in the choice of the fact and the epistemic levels
(we will come back to these notions in the sec-
tion 3.4), and the explicit or implicit meaning of
a sentence in the causal expressions in Japanese.
Furthermore, some causal expressions in Japanese
are free from the absolute and relative tense sys-
tems, and both the past and non-past forms can be
freely used in main and subordinate clauses (Chin,
1984) (an example is given in the next section). In
other words, temporal relations are not always re-
solved earlier than causal relations, and therefore
we should resolve temporal relations and causal
relations simultaneously.
Asher et al. (2003) proposed SDRT in order to
account for cases where discourse relations affect
the truth condition of sentences. Because tempo-
ral relations constrain causal relations, the explicit
or implicit meaning of a sentences and the epis-
temic level information affects preceding and fol-
lowing temporal relations in causal expressions in
Japanese, recognition also affects causal relations.
Therefore, the annotation of both causal relations
and discourse relations in corpora is expected to be
useful for CRE. Moreover, which characteristics
(such as tense, actual event time, time when the
event is recognized, meaning and structure of the
sentence and causal relations) will serve as input
and which of them will serve as output depends on
the time and place. Therefore, we should also take
into account discourse relations together with tem-
poral and causal relations. We can create special-
ized data sets for evaluating these types of infor-
mation together by annotating text with discourse,
temporal and causal relations.
However, discourse relations of SDRT are not
distributed into discourse relations and temporal
relations, and as a result the classification of labels
becomes unnecessarily complex. Therefore, it is
necessary to rearrange discourse relations as in the
following example.

‘The dog ran in the garden. The cat was

This pair of sentences is an antithesis, so we an-
notate it with the “Contrast” label in SDRT. On the
other hand, the situation described in the first sen-
tence overlaps with that of the second sentence, so
we annotate this pair of sentences with the “Back-
ground” label as well. Though there are many
cases in which we can annotate a sentence with
discourse relations in this way, dividing temporal
relations from discourse relations as in this study
allows us to avoid overlapping discourse relations.
This study was performed with the aim to rear-
range SDRT according to discourse relations, tem-
poral relations and causal relations separately, and
we generated specialized data sets according to
our methodology. In addition, occasionally it is
necessary to handle the actual event time and the
time when the event was recognized individually.
An example is given below.

<bodyText confidence="0.999996">
We extended and refined SDRT and developed our
own methodology for annotating main and subor-
dinate clauses, phrases located between main and
subordinate clauses (e.g., continuative conjuncts
in Japanese), two consecutive sentences and two
adjoining nodes with a discourse relation. We also
defined our own method for annotating proposi-
tions with causal and temporal relations. The re-
sult of tagging example (5a) is shown in (5b).

3.1 Temporal Relations

<bodyText confidence="0.999818466666667">
We consider the following three temporal relations
(Table 1). We assume that they represent the rela-
tions between two events in propositions and indi-
cate a start time and an end time. In addition, we
also assume that (start time of e) &lt; (end time of e)

ment of each two events is limited to the three re-
lations in Table 1.
In this regard, Japanese non-past predicates
occasionally express habitually repeating events,
which have to be distinguished from events occur-
ring later than the reference point. In this paper, in
annotating the scope of the repetition, habitually
repeating events are described as in the following

</subsectionHeader>

We consider the following discourse relations
based on SDRT (Table 3). There are also relations
that impose limitations on temporal and causal re-
lations (Table 4). The way temporal, causal and
discourse relations affect each other is described
below together with their correspondence to the
relations in SDRT. Bold-faced entries represent
relations integrated in SDRT in our study.
Such limitations on temporal relations provides in-
formation for making a decision in terms of tem-
poral order and cause/effect in the “de-tensed”
sentence structure 2 (Chin, 1984) in Japanese. An
example is given below.

the main clause based on the rule imposed by the
“Cause” relation.

3.4 Fact Level and Epistemic Level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971416666667">
A fact level proposition refers to an event and
its states, while an epistemic level proposition
refers to speaker’s recognizing event of a described
event. In Japanese, the latter form is often marked
by the suffix noda that attaches to all kinds of
predicates (which may also be omitted). Both
overt and covert noda introduce embedded struc-
tures, and we annotate them in such a way that a
fact level proposition is embedded in an epistemic
level proposition.
Semantically, the most notable difference be-
tween the two levels is that the tense in the former
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996081">
36
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946894736842">
represents the time that an event takes place, while
the tense in the latter represents the time that the
speaker recognizes the event.
This distinction between the two types of propo-
sitions is carried over to the distinction between
the fact level and the epistemic level causal rela-
tions. We annotate the former by the tag “Cause”
and the latter by the tag “Explanation”.
In Japanese, a causal marker such as node (a
continuation form of noda) and kara are both used
in the fact level and the epistemic level. The fact
level causality is a causal relation between the
two events, while the epistemic level causality is a
causal relation between the two recognizing events
of the two events mentioned. Therefore, in the
causal construction, it happens that the precedence
relations between the subordinate and the matrix
clauses in the fact level and the epistemic level do
not coincide, as in the following example.

The temporal relation at the fact level is that 7r3
precedes 7r1. By contrast, that at the epistemic
level is that 7r2 precedes 7r4. By describing the
relation between 7r1 and 7r3 and that between 7r2
and 7r4 separately, we can reproduce the relation-
ship at both levels.

We defined our methodology for annotating text
fragments at both the fact and epistemic levels in
parallel with temporal, causal and discourse re-
lations. Therefore, we can generate specialized
data sets that enable estimating the causality in the
fact and epistemic levels by various cues (such as
known causal relations, truth condition, conjunc-
tions and temporal relations between sentences or
clauses).
In addition, we can say that causal expressions
without causation are not in a causal relation (and
vice versa) by annotating text with both discourse
and causal relations.

We applied our methodology to 66 sentences from
the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written
Japanese (BCCWJ) (Maekawa, 2008). The sen-
tences were decomposed by one annotator, and la-
bels were assigned to the decomposed segments
by two annotators. During labeling, we used the
labels presented in Section 3. Our methodology
was developed based on 96 segments (38 sen-
tences), and by using the other 100 segments (28
sentences), we evaluated the inter-annotator agree-
ment as well as the frequencies of decomposition
and times of annotation. The agreement for 196
segments generated from 28 sentences amounted
to 0.68 and was computed as follows (the kappa
coefficient for them amounted to 0.79).

We can see from Table 5 that “Narration” was
the most frequent one, while “Alternation” never
appeared. As s result, we can assume that frequent
relations will be separated from non-frequent rela-
tions. So far, all the relations are either frequent or
non-frequent. We should re-analyze the data with
more samples again.
When the methodology was applied to 28 sen-
tences, a total of 100 and an average of 3.57 seg-
ments were derived. This is the number of seg-
ments at both the fact and epistemic levels. With-
out dividing the fact and epistemic levels, an aver-
age of 1.79 segments were derived.
On average, 11 segments per hour were tagged
in our study. Although we should evaluate the va-
lidity after having computed the average decom-
position times, it is assumed that our methodology
is valid when focusing only on labeling.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997089375">
We analyzed errors in this annotation exercise.
The annotators often found difficulties in judging
temporal relations in the following two cases: (1)
the case where it was difficult to determine the
scope of the segments pairing and (2) the case
where formalization of lexical meaning is difficult.
In regard to the first case, how to divide seg-
ments sometimes affects temporal relations. In the
following example, consider the temporal relation
between the first and the second sentences.
(9) Marason-ni syutuzyoo-sita.
marathon-DAT participate-past.
sonohi-wa 6zi-ni kisyoo-si,
that.day-TOP 6:00-at get.up-past,
10zi-ni totyoo-kara
10:00-at Metropolitan.Government-from
syuppatu-site, 12zi-ni
leave-past, 12:00-at
kansoo-sita.
finish.running-past.
‘I participated in marathon. I got up at
6:00 on that day and left the Metropolitan
Government at 10:00 and finished running
at 12:00.’
When we focus on the first segment of the sec-
ond sentnce (‘I got up at 6:00’), its relation to the
first sentence appears to be “Precedence”. How-
ever, if we consider the second and the third seg-
ments as the same segment, their relation to the
first sentence appears to be “Subsumption”.
Therefore, we should establish clear criteria for
the segmentation. Although we currently adopts a
criterion that we chose smaller segment in unclear
cases, there still remain 9 unclear cases (tempo-
ral:5, discourse:4).
One of the reason why Kappa coefficient marks
relatively high score is that we only compare the
labels and ignore the difference in the segmenta-
tions. Criteria for deciding the segment scope in
paring segments will improve our methodology.
The second case is exemplified by the tempo-
ral relation between the subordinate clause and the
main clause in the following sentence.
(10) Migawari-no tomo-o
scapegoat-GEN friend-ACC
sukuu-tame-ni hasiru-noda.
to.save run-noda.
‘I run to save my friend who is my scape-
goat.’
If we consider that the saving event only spans
over the very moment of saving, the relation be-
tween the clauses appears to be “Precedence”.
However, if we consider that running event is a
part of the saving event, the relation between the
clauses is “Subsumption”.
Thus, judging lexical meaning with respect to
when events start and end involves some difficul-
ties and they yield delicate cases in judging tem-
poral relations.
These problems are mutually related, and the
first problem arises when the components of a lex-
ical meaning are displayed explicitly in the sen-
tence, and the second problem arises when they
are implicit.

and fact level and epistemic level propositions and
evaluated the annotations of 100 segments (28 sen-
tences) in terms of agreement, frequencies and
times for decompositions. We reported and an-
alyzed the result and discussed problems of our
methodology.
The discrepancies of decomposition patterns
were not yet empirically compared in the present
study and will be investigated in future work.

Furthermore, some causal expressions in Japanese are free from the absolute and relative tense systems, and both the past and non-past forms can be freely used in main and subordinate clauses (Chin, 1984) (an example is given in the next section). In other words, temporal relations are not always resolved earlier than causal relations, and therefore we should resolve temporal relations and causal relations simultaneously. Asher et al. (2003) proposed SDRT in order to account for cases where discourse relations affect the truth condition of sentences. Because temporal relations constrain causal relations, the explicit or implicit meaning of a sentences and the epistemic level information affects preceding and following temporal relations in causal expressions in Japanese, recognition also affec</context>

There are also relations that impose limitations on temporal and causal relations (Table 4). The way temporal, causal and discourse relations affect each other is described below together with their correspondence to the relations in SDRT. Bold-faced entries represent relations integrated in SDRT in our study. Such limitations on temporal relations provides information for making a decision in terms of temporal order and cause/effect in the “de-tensed” sentence structure 2 (Chin, 1984) in Japanese. An example is given below.

We applied our methodology to a number of text fragments taken from the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese. We evaluated the feasibility of our methodology in terms of agreement and frequencies, and discussed the results of the analysis. 1 Introduction In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to deep semantic processing. Many studies (Betherd et al., 2008), (Inui et al., 2007), (Inui et al., 2003), (Riaz and Girju, 2013) have been recently conducted on deep semantic processing, and causal relation extraction (CRE) is one of the specific tasks in deep semantic processing. Research on CRE is still developing and there are many obstacles that must be overcome. Inui et al. (2003) acquired cause and effect pairs from text, where the antecedent events were taken as causes and consequent events were taken as effects based on Japanese keywords such as kara and node. In (1), for example, the antecedent ame-ga hutta (‘it rained’) and the consequent mizutamari-ga dekita (‘puddles emerged’) are ac</context>

Though in such sentences that contain causal expressions there are no causal relations between antecedents and consequents, in existing studies each sentence containing a causal expression was extracted as knowledge representing cause and effect, such as in (Inui et al., 2003). It is difficult for computers to auto-recognize and exclude such cases. In this paper, we report on the analysis of necessary information for acquiring more accurate cause-effect knowledge and propose a methodology for creating a Japanese corpus for CRE. First, we introduce previous studies and describe information that should be used to annotate data sets. Next, we describe our methodology based on Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher et al., 2003). Finally, we evaluate the validity of our methodology in terms of agreement and frequency, and analyze the results. 2 Previou</context>

Therefore, we can generate specialized data sets that enable estimating the causality in the fact and epistemic levels by various cues (such as known causal relations, truth condition, conjunctions and temporal relations between sentences or clauses). In addition, we can say that causal expressions without causation are not in a causal relation (and vice versa) by annotating text with both discourse and causal relations. 4 Results We applied our methodology to 66 sentences from the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ) (Maekawa, 2008). The sentences were decomposed by one annotator, and labels were assigned to the decomposed segments by two annotators. During labeling, we used the labels presented in Section 3. Our methodology was developed based on 96 segments (38 sentences), and by using the other 100 segments (28 sentences), we evaluated the inter-annotator agreement as well as the frequencies of decomposition and times of annotation. The agreement for 196 segments generated from 28 sentences amounted to 0.68 and was computed as follows (the kappa coefficient for them amounted to 0.79). Agreement = Agreed labels/Total l</context>

This paper offers an Embodied Construc-
tion Grammar (Feldman et al. 2010) rep-
resentation of caused motion, thereby al-
so providing (a sample of) the computa-
tional infrastructure for implementing the
information that FrameNet has character-
ized as Caused_motion1 (Ruppenho-
fer et al. 2010). This work specifies the
semantic structure of caused motion in
natural language, using an Embodied
Construction Grammar analyzer that in-
cludes the semantic parsing of linguisti-
cally instantiated constructions. Results
from this type of analysis can serve as the
input to NLP applications that require

Computational linguistics recognizes the difficul-
ty in articulating the nature of complex events,
including causation, while understanding that
doing so is fundamental for creating natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) systems (e.g. Girju
2003, Quang et al. 2011), and more generally for
other computational techniques (Guyon et al.
2007, Friedman et al. 2000). Also, although in-
sightful, linguistic analyses of causation are in-
sufficient for systems that require drawing the
inferences that humans draw with ease. Such sys-
tems must incorporate information about the pa-
rameters that support drawing these inferences.
Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG) pro-
vides the computational and representational ap-
paratus for capturing what language expresses.
FrameNet (FN) frames capture event structure
in terms of the participants that play a role in that
event. ECG provides a means for the automatic

Chang et al. (2002) constitutes the first effort to
represent the prose description of the information
that FN has defined in semantic frames in formal
terms. The work provided an ECG representation
of FN’s (then) Commerce frame, showing the
perspicuity of doing so to account for linguistic
perspective, and ultimately useful in translating
FN information into a representation needed for
event simulation (Narayanan 1997). Building on
Chang et al. (2002), this paper focuses on the
analysis and representation of the meanings of
sentences describing different kinds of motion
events, using a set of related semantic frames.
Before detailing the examples that illustrate the
analysis and representation, we offer a very brief
overview of FN and ECG.

A FN frame definition includes a prose de-

situation in which a THEME starts out at a
SOURCE, moves along a PATH, and ends up at a
GOAL.2 Example (1) illustrates FN’s analysis of
SLIDE, one of many LUs, in the Motion

2.2 Embodied Construction Grammar
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9918205">
An ECG grammar (Feldman et al. 2010) consists
of structured lattices of two basic primitives:
schemas and constructions. As with other forms
of construction grammar, a key tenet of ECG is
that each construction is a form-meaning pair.
Constructional meaning is represented using
schemas, which are analogous to FN frames.
Each schema includes several roles (comparable
to FN’s FEs), and specifies various types of con-
straints on its roles. Thus, the ECG formalism
provides the means for representing frame struc-
ture and relations in a precise and computational-
ly tractable manner.
Crucially, our computationally implemented
system (Bryant 2008) uses an ECG grammar for
sentence interpretation and produces construc-
tion-based semantic parses. The Constructional
Analyzer utilizes form and meaning infor-
mation in the constructional analysis of a given
sentence. Thus, constructional analysis is not just
a form match; importantly, it is a meaning match
as well. The output of the analysis is a semantic
specification, a meaning representation in the
form of schemas, roles, bindings, and role-filler
information. Constructional analysis is part of a
larger model of language understanding, in
which the semantic specification, in conjunction
with discourse and situational context, serves as
an input for a simulation process, which fleshes

out and supports further inferences about the rel-
atively schematic meaning specified in the text.
Among the potential applications for such
deep semantic analysis are question-answering
tasks, information extraction, and identifying
different political viewpoints. Each task has its
own requirements in terms of constructions and
semantic representations. This paper illustrates a
computationally implemented means for deter-
mining the frames and frame roles in a given
sentence, as well as the particular entities that
link to those roles.
Figure 1 shows the ECG formalism that repre-
sents the semantic structure of FN’s Motion
frame, where the MotionPath schema specifies
the structural relationships among the partici-
pants (FEs) in FN’s Motion frame.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.998825">
Figure 1: MotionPath Schema
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99841672">
ECG defines MotionPath as a subcase of the
very general Motion schema; as a child of the
Motion schema, MotionPath inherits the struc-
ture of Motion, the latter including a mover role.
Also, MotionPath evokes a Source-Path-Goal
(SPG) schema, which includes the roles source,
path, and goal, for the initial, medial, and final
locations, respectively, of a trajector. MotionPath
also includes a constraint that the mover is
bound to the trajector role.
A construction is a pairing between form and
meanng, the ECG representation of which con-
sists of a form block and a meaning block. To
illustrate, in Figure 2, which shows the simple
lexical construction Slid_Past, the form block
indicates the orthographic form associated with
the lexical construction. The form constraint in-
dicates that the constraint applies to the form of
the construction (self.f.orth &lt;-- “slid”), where
.orth indicates that the form is a text string, in
this case “slid”. ECG represents constructional
meaning using schemas; in the Slid_Past con-
struction, (Figure 2), the meaning is identified
with the MotionPath schema (as shown in Figure
1). Constructions also define relations to other

constructions in the grammar. For instance,
Slid_Past is a subcase of a more general
PastTense construction. The PastTense construc-
tion is one of several general verb conjugation
constructions in the grammar, each of which cap-
tures general facts about tense and aspect associ-
ated with different verb conjugation forms. For
example, all past tense verbs, including slid (an
instantiation of Slid_Past), use PastTense.

3.2 Embodied Construction Grammar

<bodyText confidence="0.999571">
The ECG representation of CauseMotion, given
in Figure 3, is a complex schema that combines
the structure of causation with that of transla-
tional motion. The causal structure is supplied by
defining CauseMotion as a subcase of a more
general CauseEffect schema, which includes
roles for a causal agent and an affected entity.
Also, CauseMotion specifies that the effect is
translational motion, indicated with the addition
of a type constraint that identifies the effect with
the MotionPath schema.

Additional constraints bind the mover role of
MotionPath (Figure 1) to the affected role of
CauseMotion. Thus, the ECG mover (i.e. the FE
THEME) is bound to the affected role; and the
motion itself is bound to the effect. ECG uses the
CauseMotion schema to analyze sentences such
as Example (2), an instance of the Cause_motion
construction, a summary of which follows below

Here, we provide an overview of the ECG analy-
sis process for the examples discussed above.
A basic tenet of construction grammar is that
each sentence instantiates multiple constructions.
Bryant’s (2008) computationally implemented
Constructional Analyzer uses an ECG grammar
to determine the set of constructions that best-fit
a given sentence.4 The assessment of “best-fit”
takes both syntactic and semantic information
into account. Constructional unification requires
compatibility between unifying elements. Unifi-
cation tests the compatibility of the constraints
that these constructions specify, and leads to var-
ious bindings. The analyzer produces a SemSpec,
i.e. a semantic specification of the sentence, that
is, a meaning representation in the form of a
network of schemas, with bindings between
schema roles and fillers of these roles.

lyzer, and allows the viewing of analysis results.

<bodyText confidence="0.99834675">
To illustrate the analysis process, we revisit
Example (1) The envelope slid into the mailbox,
which instantiates some of the following lexical
and grammatical constructions:

<listItem confidence="0.9676354">
• Lexical constructions for slid, nouns (enve-
lope, mailbox), and determiners (the)
• NP constructions (the envelope, the mailbox)
• Declarative construction, a clause-level con-
struction spanning the sentence as a whole.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926981132076">
In what follows, we define and explain the
constructions in Example (1) that are crucial for
the present analysis of Motion and CausedMo-
tion. Specifically, the Active_Motion_Path con-
struction (Figure 4) is a sub-case of a more gen-
eral Argument Structure construction (Goldberg
1995, Dodge 2010). Argument Structure (A-S)
constructions specify general patterns of role ex-
pression associated with the description of basic
experiences, such as those involving motion,
perception, object transfer, actions and/or causa-
tion. Schemas represent each type of experience
and include roles for the relevant participant(s).
A-S constructions include one or more constitu-
ent constructions, specified within their con-
structional block. All A-S constructions include
a verb constituent (V: Verb); here, note that the
Active_Motion_Path construction also contains a
prepositional phrase constituent (PP), con-
strained to be of type Path-PP, a general con-
struction that identifies its meaning with the SPG
schema. The form block specifies ordering con-
straints: the V constituent comes before the PP
constituent. The meaning block specifies that the
construction’s meaning is identified with the Mo-
tionPath schema, indicating that the construction
describes translational motion events. Con-
straints within the meaning block specify how
the meaning of the construction as a whole com-
poses with the meanings of its constituents. As is
usually the case, the ‘V’ constituent shares the
same schematic meaning as the A-S construc-
tion. These constraints indicate that the A-S con-
struction will unify with verbs that identify their
meaning with the MotionPath schema, as in the
motion verbs roll, slip, bounce, etc, along with
slide. Thus, this A-S construction captures a par-
ticular valence pattern associated with several
semantically similar verbs.
A further meaning constraint indicates that the
meaning of the PP constituent serves to elaborate
the SPG schema that forms part of the meaning
of the MotionPath schema. That is, whichever
specific PP serves as a constituent in a given ex-
ample will supply more information about the
particular path of motion the mover is following.
Additionally, the mover role of MotionPath is
bound to the profiledParticipant role (i.e., the
semantic correlate of the role expressed in the
sentence’s subject slot), and the meaning of the
construction as a whole binds to an eventProcess
role, which indicates the type of event that this
A-S construction describes.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.994501">
Figure 4: Active_Motion_Path Construction
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999930444444444">
Constraint-based unification of the instantiated
construction produces a SemSpec that includes
the following information: (1) a MotionPath
schema is co-indexed with the ‘eventProcess’
role, indicating that the sentence describes an
event of translational motion; (2) the meaning of
the envelope is co-indexed with the profiledPar-
ticipant role, the mover of MotionPath, and the
trajector of SPG, indicating that this object is the
semantic subject of the sentence, and that it is the
entity that moves and changes location with re-
spect to a landmark; and (3) the meaning of the
mailbox is co-indexed with the landmark of SPG,
and the boundedObject role of a BoundedObject
schema. The source of SPG is bound to the exte-
rior role of boundedObject. The goal of SPG is
bound to the interior of boundedObject. Togeth-
er, these bindings indicate that the mailbox is
conceptualized as a bounded object or container,
the envelope’s initial location (source) is outside
of the mailbox, and its final location is inside.
Having analyzed a sentence about motion, we
return to our example of caused motion: (2)
Smedlap slid the envelope into the mailbox. This
sentence instantiates many of the same construc-
tions as does Example (1). The key difference
between the two is the A-S construction, here the

<bodyText confidence="0.9999531">
This is similar to the Active_Motion_Path con-
struction in that it has both a V and a PP constit-
uent. However, as with other A-S constructions
that characterize transitives, this A-S construc-
tion also includes an NP constituent, whose form
follows that of the verb. Crucially, this A-S con-
struction identifies its meaning with CauseMo-
tion, indicating that it is used to describe scenes
which a causal agent causes the translational mo-
tion of some other entity. Meaning constraints
specify that the affected role of CauseMotion is
bound to the meaning of the NP constituent, and
the causer role is bound to the profiled partici-
pant role. This latter constraint indicates that this
active voice construction describes caused mo-
tion events from the causer’s perspective.
Using these constructions, the analysis of Ex-
ample (2) produces a SemSpec that is similar to
that produced for Example (1), with the follow-
ing key differences:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.90414895">
• the eventProcess is CausedMotion (ra-
ther than MotionPath);
• the profiledParticipant role is bound to
the causer role of CauseMotion, and to
Smedlap;
• the envelope is bound to the affected
role of CauseMotion, as well as to the
mover role of MotionPath, and the tra-
jector role of SPG.
This SemSpec for Example (2) indicates that:
• the sentence describes an event of caused
motion, represented by the CauseMotion
schema;
• the caused effect is motion, represented
by the MotionPath schema;
• the subject (Smedlap) is the causer of the
motion;
• the direct object (the envelope) is the
causally affected entity that moves.
• the path of motion is one where with the

goal location inside the entity that the
prepositional phrase object (the mailbox)
specifies, just as in Example (1).
To summarize, the semantic representation
output of the ECG analysis process for each of
Examples (1) and (2) identifies that they evoke
the MotionPath and CauseMotion schemas, re-
spectively (analogous to FN’s Motion and
Cause_Motion, respectively). Also, the out-
put specifies the different roles (FEs) that the
different constituents of each sentence realize.
Thus, the information provided by such output
identifies the frames and frame roles expressed
in each sentence.

Given the compositional nature of the ECG
grammar, it will also support the analysis of oth-
er sentences describing translational motion and
caused motion events that differ in terms of the
lexical items that are realized. Consider the fol-
lowing new examples.

• Did the dog roll the ball under the table?

Moreover, the approach outlined here clearly
also would apply to the analysis of all FrameNet
frames that characterize, for instance, cognition,
perception, communication or other causal
events or transitive actions.
Research has begun to extend the present work
to support the analysis of metaphorical uses of
motion and caused motion frame structure, as in:
The young family slid into poverty or Their huge
debts dragged the young family into poverty.
This research requires the specification of appro-
priate constraints on the fillers of the roles that
will facilitate distinguishing between the literal
and the metaphorical.

(2002) constitutes the first effort to represent the prose description of the information that FN has defined in semantic frames in formal terms. The work provided an ECG representation of FN’s (then) Commerce frame, showing the perspicuity of doing so to account for linguistic perspective, and ultimately useful in translating FN information into a representation needed for event simulation (Narayanan 1997). Building on Chang et al. (2002), this paper focuses on the analysis and representation of the meanings of sentences describing different kinds of motion events, using a set of related semantic f</context>

For example, FN has defined Motion as a situation in which a THEME starts out at a SOURCE, moves along a PATH, and ends up at a GOAL.2 Example (1) illustrates FN’s analysis of SLIDE, one of many LUs, in the Motion frame, also indicating which constituents in the sentence are the linguistic realizations of the FEs THEME and GOAL. (1) [The envelope THEME] SLID [into the mailbox GOAL]. 2.2 Embodied Construction Grammar An ECG grammar (Feldman et al. 2010) consists of structured lattices of two basic primitives: schemas and constructions. As with other forms of construction grammar, a key tenet of ECG is that each construction is a form-meaning pair. Constructional meaning is represented using schemas, which are analogous to FN frames. Each schema includes several roles (comparable to FN’s FEs), and specifies various types of constraints on its roles. Thus, the ECG formalism provides the means for representing frame structure and relations in a precise and computationally tractable manner. Crucially, our computationally implemented system (Brya</context>

In what follows, we define and explain the constructions in Example (1) that are crucial for the present analysis of Motion and CausedMotion. Specifically, the Active_Motion_Path construction (Figure 4) is a sub-case of a more general Argument Structure construction (Goldberg 1995, Dodge 2010). Argument Structure (A-S) constructions specify general patterns of role expression associated with the description of basic experiences, such as those involving motion, perception, object transfer, actions and/or causation. Schemas represent each type of experience and include roles for the relevant participant(s). A-S constructions include one or more constituent constructions, specified within their constructional block. All A-S constructions include a verb constituent (V: Verb); here, note that the Active_Motion_Path construction also contains a prepositional phrase constitue</context>

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9999445">
We present an encompassing research en-
deavour on the public accountability of
new modes of governance in Europe. The
aim of this project is to measure the
salience, tonality and framing of regula-
tory bodies and public interest organisa-
tions in newspaper coverage and parlia-
mentary debates over the last 15 years.
In order to achieve this, we use language
technology which is still underused in po-
litical science text analyses. Institution-
ally, the project has emerged from a col-
laboration between a computational lin-
guistics and a political science department.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99998225">
The institutionalization of the regulatory state in
Europe entailed new modes of governance such
as transgovernmental networks between officials
and non-state authorities or the involvement of pri-
vate corporations (e.g. rating agencies) in the pol-
icy processes (Gilardi, 2005; Abbott and Snidal,
2008). At the subnational level, the emergence
of regulatory agencies and public-private partner-
ships spreading across metropolitan regions have
come to challenge traditional state institutions
(Kelleher and Lowery, 2009). Since these new
modes of governance organize political authority
along functional rather than territorial lines, many
observers are worried about their potential “demo-
cratic deficit” (Dahl, 1994; Follesdal and Hix,
2006; Keohane et al., 2009). In response to these
considerations, scholars usually point to the ad-
ministrative and professional accountability mech-
anisms of governmental and parliamentary over-
sight as well as judicial review (Majone, 2000;

Lodge, 2002; Busuioc, 2009). Other, more in-
formal accountability mechanisms such as media
coverage and public involvement, in contrast, have
been either neglected, dismissed as scarcely rele-
vant or dealt with only in comparative case stud-
ies (Maggetti, 2012). This is surprising, given that
public communication plays an ever more deci-
sive role for setting the political agenda and estab-
lishing transparency of policy making in modern
democratic societies (Walgrave et al., 2008; Koop-
mans and Statham, 2010; M¨uller, forthcoming).
With respect to the public accountability of new
modes of governance, the media can thus be ex-
pected to constitute a key intermediary variable for
the progressive formalization and institutionaliza-
tion of voluntary private rules through reputational
mechanisms (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2006).
This paper is structured as follows. In section 2
we present our core research question, in section
3 we summarize our research methods, and in sec-
tion 4 we briefly present a pilot study.

2 Research Question
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999927153846154">
It is important to ask whether and to what ex-
tent public communication systematically exposes
new modes of governance to public accountabil-
ity. More precisely, the project’s ambition is to
determine how much attention the media and par-
liamentary debates dedicate to survey the regula-
tory bodies and public interest organizations un-
der scrutiny, whether they watch these actors crit-
ically, and whether they report on these actors in
terms of frames which are conductive to their pub-
lic accountability, e.g. norm and rule compliance,
transparency, efficiency or responsiveness to pub-
lic demands.

3 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999278125">
To answer these questions, the project implements
approaches developed in computational linguistics
and web automation in order to collect and classify
big text data at the European level (European and
internationally relevant newspapers), the domes-
tic level in four countries (newspapers in the U.K.,
France, Germany and Switzerland), and the sub-
national level in eight metropolitan areas (parlia-
mentary debates and newspapers relevant for Lon-
don, Birmingham, Paris, Lyon, Berlin, Stuttgart,
Berne and Zurich). The project (1) starts from an
encompassing gazetteer of actors involved in the
new modes of governance in the areas and coun-
tries mentioned above, (2) uses application pro-
gramming interfaces (API) and webscraping tech-
niques to establish a large representative text cor-
pus in English, French and German, (3) calculates
the salience of the actors of interest by means of
named entity recognition, coreference resolution
and keyword detection, (4) applies sentiment de-
tection and opinion mining to estimate the tonality
of these actors, (5) uses relation mining methods
(Schneider et al., 2009) to detect interactions and
types of interactions between the entities of inter-
est, and (6) intends to automate the recognition of
media frames used in the context of these actors by
identifying hidden topics via latent semantic anal-
ysis (LSA) (McFarlane, 2011; Odijk et al., 2014).
As points 3-6 provide key research challenges,
we will discuss them in more detail in the fol-
lowing subsections. Before that, we present an
overview of our current pipeline.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.97523">
3.1 Pipeline
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998803">
The pipeline consists of several components
chained together in a modular way (see Figure 1).
This provides us with the possibility to exchange
components on demand. First, data acquisition is
done via the use of an API to the media content
database (e.g. LexisNexis). This allows us to fully
automate the retrieval and storage of the media
documents.
At a second stage, we employ a full natural lan-
guage processing chain which includes morpho-
logical analysis, tagging, lemmatizing, and depen-
dency parsing. On this basis, we then conduct sev-
eral more layers of analysis. On the one hand, we
use the result of the preprocessing chain for coref-
erence resolution and sentiment analysis as well
as relation mining. On the other hand, we also
integrate further tools such as named entity recog-
nition and LSA which can be applied on the full
text or corpus level. The thus enriched data is then
aggregated and stored in a database.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.999848">
Figure 1: Scheme of pipeline
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996288">
Finally, the actual data analysis can be con-
ducted by querying the database, based on the al-
ready available information or an adapted setting
suitable to the requirements of the media content
analysis.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9934755">
3.2 Salience, Named Entities and
Coreferences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985909090909">
One of the main metrics of interest is the salience
of the entities. Therefore, a reliable detection of
the entities in the articles is a pivotal task. Fur-
thermore it is crucial to find those occurences of
entities in the text which are not directly detectable
by using a gazetter, since journalists often use ref-
erences to the entities in the same article. Hence,
we will integrate coreference resolution (Klenner
and Tuggener, 2011) into our pipeline. In addi-
tion, we will also create a resource which will
allow us to integrate external information on the
entities, thus increasing the performance of the
coreference resolution. For example, politicians
are often mentioned with their name, their func-
tion (e.g. National Council), their party affiliation,
their age, or a combination of such attributes. To-
gether with the metadata of the media documents
(media source, and time of publication) it is then
possible to calculate these attributes and possible
combinations and include them in the coreference
resolution module in order to increase both preci-
sion and recall.

3.3 From Sentiment Detection to Opinion
Mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956">
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are re-
search areas in computational linguistics which
have received growing attention in the last decade
(Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu and Zhang, 2012). In or-
der to detect the tonality in the media coverage to-
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999938666666666">
wards the actors under scrutiny, we use a lexicon-
based compositional sentiment analysis system
component similar to Taboada et al. (2011). How-
ever, our approach is additionally based on the out-
put of the full dependency parse and the results of
the named entity recognition and coreference res-
olution. This will provide us with the ability to
perform target-specific tonality calculation.
In addition to the mere calculation of sentiment
or tonality over a whole article, our task includes
the detection of sentiment on the sentence level
and in respect to certain targets (i.e. entities). An
additional challenge is to detect quotations includ-
ing their sources and targets, since they may reveal
the actors’ most opinionated stances towards each
other (Balahur et al., 2009). From this perspec-
tive, opinion mining can be seen as a sister disci-
pline to sentiment analysis, which we can employ
to map utterances of actors towards other actors,
or towards specific political topics, stepping from
classical sentiment detection to relation and opin-
ion mining. We will focus on high precision as-
signment of the source of the statement.
It is important to note that the detection and
determination of sentiment and opinion in me-
dia documents is a challenging endeavour since
it differs in many ways from the task of previ-
ous research which has mostly considered reviews
and other clearly opinionated text (Balahur et al.,
2010). It will therefore also be necessary to adapt
the sentiment analysis system to the domain of
(political) news text and to use advanced tech-
niques to match fine-grained targets and the en-
tity to which they belong. For example, it should
be possible to assign statements of a spokesperson
to the institution he or she represents. However,
we can build on existing research, since such a
mapping can be considered similar to aspect-based
opinion mining (Zhang and Liu, 2014).

3.4 Relation Mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940352941176">
In well-resourced areas such as biomedical rela-
tion mining, the detection of interactions between
entities such as genes and proteins or drugs and
diseases is an established research focus. Training
resources are abundant, and several systems have
been evaluated in competitive challenges. Polit-
ical science texts are typically less richly anno-
tated. However, it is also possible to learn pat-
terns expressing interactions from lean document-
level annotation, by using distance-learning meth-
ods. If a document is annotated as containing the
key actors A and B, then all syntactic connec-
tions found in that document between A and B can
be assumed to provide patterns typically express-
ing interactions. Such approaches have been used
in biomedicine (Rinaldi et al., 2012) and can be
ported to the political domain.

3.5 Media Frames
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972388888889">
Associative Framing (van Atteveldt et al., 2008)
is based on measuring co-occurrence in large con-
text windows. His suggested association measure
is also different, he uses the conditional probabil-
ity of seeing concept 1 (c1) in the context of con-
cept 2 (c2), p(c1|c2). Sahlgren (2006) describes
how short context windows tend to detect syntag-
matic relations like collocations, while large con-
text windows detect paradigmatic relations. In van
Atteveldt et al. (2008), concepts are basically key-
words, while we will use vector space models,
which allow one to automatically detect concepts.
In vector space model approaches, each word is
defined by the sum of its contexts, and words
which have very similar contexts are clustered into
a concept. There are many variants of this ap-
proach: in singular-value decomposition (SVD) or
latent semantic analysis (LSA) approaches (Deer-
wester et al., 1990), the original very high dimen-
sional space is reduced to fewer dimensions. In
Word Space (Sch¨utze, 1998) each word is defined
recursively, by the contexts of its contexts, using
an observation window of up to 100 words be-
fore and after the target word. Rothenh¨ausler and
Sch¨utze (2009) have shown that approaches using
syntactic relations instead of large context win-
dows can even perform better.
In the political communication literature, the
definition of frames is contested. Matthes and
Kohring (2008) thus suggest a bottom-up, data-
driven and interactive method which on the one
hand offers the possibility to correct and guide au-
tomatic approaches as has been exemplified by Hu
et al. (2011), on the other hand the rigid consis-
tency of automatic approaches can also add new
insights for data interpretation.

lected 4445 articles from the last ten years in three
large German print and online news sources. The
institutions under scrutiny are (private) associa-
tions for technical inspection in Germany. In this
area, the T ¨UV (Technischer ¨Uberwachungsverein,
i.e., Technical Inspection Association) and its sub-
companies almost exert a regulatory monopoly.
As a first goal, we want to investigate the differ-
ence in the tonality in the media coverage towards
the institutions in this area. We therefore chose to
investigate a public scandal revolving on defective
breast implants that have been tested and certified
by a T ¨UV subcompany. Table 1 reports the results.

Table 1: Absolute counts of articles about breast

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.99958770967742">
A first interesting finding is that we only found
articles about breast implants in the last 3 years.
Considering the sentiment analysis results for
these articles, we see a clearly negative aggre-
gated result. 82.1% of the articles were of negative
tonality, compared to only 4.5% positive tonal-
ity. The remaining articles were of neutral (4.5%)
or ambivalent (8.9%) tonality. The percentage of
negative articles is even larger if only articles con-
taining mentions of T ¨UV and its subcompanies are
considered (84.3%), while the percentage of posi-
tive articles drops to 2.9%.
Furthermore, these findings are in line with the
increase in negative articles on T ¨UV subcompa-
nies during these years (see Figure 2). In fact,
from all negative articles about the T ¨UV subcom-
panies, 28.8% in 2012 and even 38.2% in 2013
contained mentions of breast implants. The scan-
dal itself was therefore responsible for the increase
in negative articles in this period.
This development can be interpreted as an in-
dication for the accountability of such institutions
in the public media, although it remains an open
question which aspects were dominant in the pub-
lic discourse considering the scandal about the
breast implants.
In sum, this pilot study increases our confidence
to be able to successfully collect the necessary
data for our main purpose, i.e. to answer the ques-
tion whether new forms of governance are held
accountable in the media. In the near future, we

plan to implement approaches that allow us to in-
ductively detect the issues brought forward in the
context of an actor in a selection of texts. More
precisely, we are planning to describe and detect
the dynamics of the debate in articles as well as
the tonality inside them.

5 Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994809523809">
We have introduced a project measuring media
coverage and applying opinion and relation min-
ing to the question of accountability of new modes
of governance in Europe. To answer how public
communication exposes them to public account-
ability, we apply computational linguistics meth-
ods ranging from named entity recognition, de-
pendency parsing and coreference resolution to
opinion and relation mining and ultimately fram-
ing.
We have given a pilot study on a public scandal
involving defective breast implants that have been
tested and certified by a T ¨UV subcompany in Ger-
many. We find, on the one hand, that most of the
articles on breast implants during the period are of
negative tonality, and on the other hand, that a cor-
responding proportion of negative articles on T ¨UV
mentions breast implants, explaining the spike in
negativity. In future research, we will detect such
spikes in a data-driven fashion and with the help of
targeted opinion and relation mining approaches.

In van Atteveldt et al. (2008), concepts are basically keywords, while we will use vector space models, which allow one to automatically detect concepts. In vector space model approaches, each word is defined by the sum of its contexts, and words which have very similar contexts are clustered into a concept. There are many variants of this approach: in singular-value decomposition (SVD) or latent semantic analysis (LSA) approaches (Deerwester et al., 1990), the original very high dimensional space is reduced to fewer dimensions. In Word Space (Sch¨utze, 1998) each word is defined recursively, by the contexts of its contexts, using an observation window of up to 100 words before and after the target word. Rothenh¨ausler and Sch¨utze (2009) have shown that approaches using syntactic relations instead of large context windows can even perform better.

Institutionally, the project has emerged from a collaboration between a computational linguistics and a political science department. 1 Introduction The institutionalization of the regulatory state in Europe entailed new modes of governance such as transgovernmental networks between officials and non-state authorities or the involvement of private corporations (e.g. rating agencies) in the policy processes (Gilardi, 2005; Abbott and Snidal, 2008).

Therefore, a reliable detection of the entities in the articles is a pivotal task. Furthermore it is crucial to find those occurences of entities in the text which are not directly detectable by using a gazetter, since journalists often use references to the entities in the same article. Hence, we will integrate coreference resolution (Klenner and Tuggener, 2011) into our pipeline. In addition, we will also create a resource which will allow us to integrate external information on the entities, thus increasing the performance of the coreference resolution. For example, politicians are often mentioned with their name, their function (e.g. National Council), their party affiliation, their age, or a combination of such attributes. Together with the metadata of the media documents (media source, and time of publication) it is then possible to calculate these attributes and possible combinations and include them in the coreference resolution module in orde</context>

This is surprising, given that public communication plays an ever more decisive role for setting the political agenda and establishing transparency of policy making in modern democratic societies (Walgrave et al., 2008; Koopmans and Statham, 20</context>

In Word Space (Sch¨utze, 1998) each word is defined recursively, by the contexts of its contexts, using an observation window of up to 100 words before and after the target word. Rothenh¨ausler and Sch¨utze (2009) have shown that approaches using syntactic relations instead of large context windows can even perform better. In the political communication literature, the definition of frames is contested. Matthes and Kohring (2008) thus suggest a bottom-up, datadriven and interactive method which on the one hand offers the possibility to correct and guide automatic approaches as has been exemplified by Hu et al. (2011), on the other hand the rigid consistency of automatic approaches can also add new insights for data interpretation. 4 Pilot Study As a short glimpse at the potential of our research we present first data from a small pilot study.

It will therefore also be necessary to adapt the sentiment analysis system to the domain of (political) news text and to use advanced techniques to match fine-grained targets and the entity to which they belong. For example, it should be possible to assign statements of a spokesperson to the institution he or she represents. However, we can build on existing research, since such a mapping can be considered similar to aspect-based opinion mining (Zhang and Liu, 2014). 3.4 Relation Mining In well-resourced areas such as biomedical relation mining, the detection of interactions between entities such as genes and proteins or drugs and diseases is an established research focus.

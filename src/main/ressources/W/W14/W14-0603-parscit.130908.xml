Named entity recognition for novel domains
can be challenging in the absence of suitable
training materials for machine-learning or lex-
icons and gazetteers for term look-up. We de-
scribe an approach that starts from a small,
manually created word list of commodities
traded in the nineteenth century, and then uses
semantic web techniques to augment the list
by an order of magnitude, drawing on data
stored in DBpedia. This work was conducted
during the Trading Consequences project on
text mining and visualisation of historical doc-
uments for the study of global trading in the

<bodyText confidence="0.999890692307692">
The Trading Consequences project1 aims to assist en-
vironmental historians in understanding the economic
and environmental consequences of commodity trad-
ing during the nineteenth century. We are applying text
mining to large quantities of historical text in order to
convert unstructured textual information into structured
data that can be queried and visualised. While prior his-
torical research into commodity flows (Cronon, 1991;
Cushman, 2013; Innis and Drache, 1995; McCook,
2006; Tully, 2009) has focused on a small number
of widely traded natural resources, the large corpora
of digitised documents processed by Trading Conse-
quences is giving historians data about a much broader
range of commodities. A detailed appraisal of trade in
these resources will yield a significantly more accurate
picture of globalisation and its environmental conse-
quences.
In this paper we focus on our approach to building a
lexicon to support the recognition of commodity terms
in text. We provide some background to this work in
Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the process of cre-
ating the lexicon; this starts from a manually collected
seed set of commodity terms which is then expanded
semi-automatically using DBpedia.2 An evaluation of
the quality of the commodity lexicon is provided in
Section 4.

mentioned as points of origin, transit or destination and
whether vocabulary relating to diseases and disasters
appears in the text. All mined information is added
back into the XML documents as different layers of
stand-off annotation.
The annotations are subsequently used to populate a
relational database. This stores not just metadata about
the individual document, but also detailed information
that results from the text mining, such as named enti-
ties, relations, and how these are expressed in the rel-
evant document in context. Visualisations and a query
interface access the database so that users can either
search the mined information directly through textual
queries or browse the data in a more exploratory man-
ner. A temporal dimension for the visualisation is
provided by correlating commodity mentions in doc-
uments with the publication date of those documents.
All information mined from the collections is linked
back to the original documents of the data providers.
We analyse textual data from a variety of sources,
including the House of Commons Parliamentary Pa-
pers (HCPP)6 from ProQuest;7 the Early Canadiana On-
line data archive (ECO) from Canadian.org;8 the Di-

at Kew Gardens available at Jstor Global Plants

lections (CPRINT);10 and a subpart of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office Collection (FCOC) from Jstor.11
Together these sources amount to over 10 million pages
of text and over 7 billion word tokens. Table 1 provides

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99420255">
In recent years, the dominant paradigm for NER has
been supervised machine learning (Tjong Kim Sang
and De Meulder, 2003). However, to be effective, this
requires a considerable investment of effort in manu-
ally preparing suitable training data. Since we lacked
the resources to create such data, we decided instead
to provide the system with a look-up list of commodity
terms. While there is substantial continuity over time in
the materials that are globally traded as commodities,
it is difficult to work with a modern list of commod-
ity terms as they include many things that did not exist,
or were not widely traded, in the nineteenth century.
There are also a relatively large number of commodi-
ties traded in the nineteenth century that are no longer
used, including a range of materials for dyes and some
nineteenth century drugs. As a result, we set out to de-
velop a new lexicon of commodities traded in the nine-
teenth century.
Before discussing in detail the methods that we used,
it is useful to consider some of our requirements. First
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998339">
14
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.991762416666667">
we wanted to be able to capture the fact that there can
be multiple names for the same commodity; for exam-
ple, rubber might be referred to in several ways, includ-
ing not just rubber but also India rubber, caoutchouc
and caouchouc. Second, we wanted to include a lim-
ited amount of hierarchical structure in order to sup-
port querying, both in the database interface and also
in the visualisation process. For example, it ought
be possible to group together limes, apples and or-
anges within a common category (or hypernym) such
as Fruit. Third, we wanted the freedom to add arbi-
trary attributes to terms, such as noting that both nuts
and whales are a source of oil.
These considerations argued in favour of a frame-
work that had more structure than a simple list of
terms, but was more like a thesaurus than a dictionary
or linguistically-organised lexicon.12 This made SKOS
(Simple Knowledge Organization System—Miles and
Bechhofer (2009)) an obvious choice for organising the
thesaurus. SKOS assumes that the ‘hierarchical back-
bone’ of the thesaurus is organised around concepts.
These are semantic rather than linguistic entities, and
serve as the hooks to which lexical labels are attached.
SKOS employs the Resource Description Framework
(RDF)13 as a representation language; in particular,
SKOS concepts are identified by URIs. Every concept
has a unique ‘preferred’ (or canonical) lexical label (ex-
pressed by the property skos:prefLabel), plus any
number of alternative lexical labels (expressed by the
property skos:altLabel). Both of these RDF prop-
erties take string literals (with an optional language tag)
as values.
The graph in Figure 4 illustrates how SKOS al-
lows preferred and alternative lexical labels to be at-
tached to a concept such as dbp:Natural_Rubber.
Figure 4 illustrates a standard shortening for URIs,

where a prefix such as dbp: is an alias for the names-
pacehttp://dbpedia.org/resource/. Con-
sequently dbp:Natural\_Rubber is an abbrevia-
tion that expands to the full URI http://dbpedia.
12The Lemon lexicon model (McCrae et al., 2010) is based
on SKOS, but its richer structure, while linguistically well mo-
tivated, is more complex than we require for our application.
13http://www.w3.org/RDF/
org/resource/Natural\_Rubber. In an anal-
ogous way, skos: and rdf: are prefixes that rep-
resent namespaces for the SKOS and RDF vocabularies
respectively.
While a SKOS thesaurus provides a rich organisa-
tional structure for representing knowledge about our
domain, it is not in itself directly usable by our text
mining tools; a further step is required to place the
prefLabel and altLabel values from the the-
saurus into the XML-based lexicon structure required
by the LT-XML2 toolkit during named entity recogni-
tion. We will discuss this in more detail in Section 3.2.
In the remainder of this section, we first describe
how we created a seed set of commodity terms man-
ually and then explain how we used it to bootstrap a
much larger commodity lexicon.

We took as our starting point the records of the Boards
of Customs, Excise, and Customs and Excise, and HM
Revenue and Customs held at the National Archives.14
They include a collation of annual ledger books list-
ing all of the major goods, ranging from live animals
to works of art, imported into Great Britain during any
given year during the nineteenth century. These con-
tain a wealth of material, including a list of the quantity
and value of the commodities broken down by country.
For the purpose of developing a list of commodities,
we focused on the headings at the top of each page,
drawing on the four books of the 1866 ledgers, which
were the most detailed year available.15 All together,
the 1866 ledgers listed 760 different import categories.
This data was manually transferred to a spreadsheet in a
manner which closely reflected the original, and a por-
tion is illustrated in Figure 5. In Trading Consequences
we restricted our analysis to raw materials or lightly
processed commodities and thereby discarded all com-
modities which did not fit this definition.
The two major steps in converting the Customs
Ledger records into a SKOS format were (i) selecting a
string to serve as the SKOS prefLabel, and (ii) asso-
ciating the prefLabel with an appropriate semantic
concept. Both these steps were carried out manually.16
For obvious reasons, we wanted as far as possible to
use an existing ontology as a source of concepts. We
initially experimented with UMBEL,17 an extensive up-
per ontology in SKOS format based on OpenCyc (Ma-
tuszek et al., 2006). However UMBEL’s coverage of rel-
evant plants and botanical substances was poor, lacking

15The customs ledgers used for creation of the seed set of
commodities is stored at The National Archives (collection

16Assem et al. (2006) present a methodology for convert-
ing thesauri to SKOS format, but the resources that their case
studies take as a starting point are considerably more exten-
sive and richly structured than the data we discuss here.

3.2 Bootstrapping the Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999933466666667">
The process just described allows us to construct a
small ‘base’ SKOS thesaurus containing 319 concepts.
However it is obviously a very incomplete list of com-
modities, and by itself would give us poor recall in
identifying commodity mentions. Many kinds of prod-
uct in the Customs Ledgers included open ended sub-
categories (i.e., Oil - Seed Unenumerated or Fruit - Un-
enumerated Dried). Similarly, while the ledgers pro-
vided a comprehensive list of various gums, they only
specified anchovies, cod, eels, herrings, salmon and
turtle as types of fish, grouping all other species under
the ‘unenumerated’ subcategory.
One approach to augmenting the thesaurus would be
to integrate it with a more general purpose SKOS upper
ontology. In principle, this should be feasible, since
merging two RDF graphs is a standard operation. How-
ever, trying this approach with UMBEL threw up several
practical problems. First, UMBEL includes features that
go beyond the standard framework of SKOS and which
made graph merging harder to control. Second, this
technique made it extremely difficult to avoid adding a
large amount of information that was irrelevant to the
domain of nineteenth century commodities.
Our second approach also involved graph merging,
but tried to minimise manual intervention in determin-
ing which subparts of the general ontology to merge
into. We have already mentioned that one of our orig-
inal motivations for adopting SKOS was the presence
of a concept hierarchy; nevertheless, we had little need
for a multi-layered hierarchy of the kind found in many

upper ontologies. In addition to a class hierarchy of the
usual kind, DBpedia contains a level of category, de-
rived from the categories that are used to tag Wikipedia
pages. Figure 7 illustrates categories, such as Domes-
ticated animals, that occur on the page for donkey. We
believe that such Wikipedia categories provide a useful
and (for our purposes) sufficient level of abstraction for
grouping together the ‘leaf’ concepts that correspond
to lexical items in the SKOS thesaurus (e.g., a concept
like dbp:Donkey). Within DBpedia, these categories
are contained in the namespace http://dbpedia.

alias dbc:) and are related to concepts via the prop-
erty dcterms:subject. Given that the concepts in

our base SKOS thesaurus are drawn from DBpedia, it is
simple to augment the initial SKOS thesaurus G in the
following way: for each leaf concept L in G, augment
G with a new triple of the form ⟨L skos:broader
C⟩ (i.e., L has broader concept C) whenever L be-
longs to category C in DBpedia. To illustrate, given
our Donkey example above, we would supplement it
with the following triple:
dbp:Donkey
skos:broader dbc:Domesticated_animal
We can retrieve all of the categories associated with
each leaf concept by sending a federated query that ac-
cesses both the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint and a local
instance of the Jena Fuseki21 server which hosts our
SKOS thesaurus. Since some of the categories recov-
ered in this way were clearly too broad or out of scope,
we manually filtered the list down to a set of 355 cate-
gories before merging the new triples into the base the-
saurus.
Our next step also involved querying DBpedia, this
time to retrieve all new concepts C which belonged to
the categories recovered in the first step; we call this
sibling acquisition, since it allows us to find siblings of
leaf concepts that are children of the Wikipedia cate-
gories already present in the thesaurus. The key steps
in the procedure are illustrated in Figure 8 (where the
top node is the root concept in the SKOS thesaurus,
viz. tc:Commodity). To continue our earlier exam-
ple, the presence of dbc:Domesticated_animal
in the hierarchy triggers the addition of concepts for
animals such as camel, llama and water buffalo. Given
a base thesaurus with 319 concepts, sibling acquisition

expands the thesaurus to a size of 17,387 concepts.22
This query-based methodology contrasts with, though
is potentially complementary to, a machine learning
approach to bootstrapping named entity systems as de-
scribed, for example, by Kozareva (2006).
We mentioned earlier that in order for LT-TTT2 to
identify commodity mentions in text, it is necessary to
convert our SKOS thesaurus into an XML-based lexi-
con structure. A fragment of such a lexicon is illus-
trated in Figure 9. The preferred and alternative lexical
labels are represented via separate entries in the lex-
icon, with their value contained in the word attribute
for each entry. The concept and category information is
stored in corresponding attribute values; the pipe sym-
bol (|) is used to separate multiple categories. We have
already seen that alternative lexical labels will include
synonyms and spelling variants (e.g., chinchona ver-
sus cinchona). The set of alternative labels associated
with each concept was further augmented by a series of
postprocessing steps such as pluralisation; hyphenation
and dehyphenation (cocoa nuts versus cocoa-nuts ver-
sus cocoanuts; and the addition of selected head nouns
to form compounds (apple &gt; apple tree, groundnut &gt;
groundnut oil). Such variants are also stored in the lexi-
con as separate entries. The resulting lexicon contained
20,476 commodity terms.
During the recognition step, we perform case-
insensitive matching against the lexicon in combination
with context-dependent rules to decide whether or not
a given string is a commodity; the longest match is pre-
ferred during lookup. Linguistic pre-processing is im-
portant in this step — for example, we exclude word
tokens tagged as verb, preposition, particle or adverb
in the part-of-speech tagging. As each lexicon entry
is associated with a DBpedia concept and at least one
category, both types of information are added to the
extracted entity mentions for each successful match,
thereby linking the text-mined commodities to the hier-
archy present in the Trading Consequences commodity
thesaurus.

4.1 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997784073529412">
The quality of text mining software is often evaluated
intrinsically in terms of the precision, recall and bal-
anced F-score of its output compared to a human anno-
tated gold standard. We also use this methodology to
gain a better understanding of the quality of the com-
modity lexicon. We therefore prepared a gold stan-
dard by randomly selecting 25 documents extracts from
each of the five collections listed in Table 1. Since
many of the documents were too long to annotate in
their entirety, we split each file into sub-sections of
equal size (5000 bytes) and randomly selected one sub-
section per document containing one or more com-
modities and commodity-location relations. This re-
sulted in a set of 125 files which we divided into a pilot
set of 25 documents (5 per collection) and a main an-
notation set of 100 documents (20 per collection).
Annotator 1 was provided with guidelines on mark-
ing up entities and relations, and was asked to annotate
the 25 pilot documents using the BRAT annotation tool
(Stenetorp et al., 2012).23 After an opportunity to clar-
ify any issues, Annotator 1 carried out the main anno-
tation by correcting the system output and adding any
information that was missed by the text mining compo-
nent. We refer to the resulting human-annotated dataset
as the gold standard and compare our system output
against it. Table 2 shows that relative to our gold stan-
dard annotations, the text mining prototype, which uses
the expanded commodity lexicon described in Section
3.2), identified commodity mentions with a precision
(P) of 0.59, a recall (R) of 0.56 and an F-score of 0.57.
These scores are determined with a strict evaluation
where each commodity mention identified by the sys-
tem has to match the manually annotated mention ex-
actly in terms of its boundaries and type to count as
a true positive. As soon as one boundary differs —
for example, if the annotator identified palm and the
system identified palm trees —- the mis-match counts
as both a false positive and a false negative. In order
to understand how often the commodity extraction re-
sults in a boundary error, we also applied a lax evalua-
tion where a true positive is counted if both boundaries
match exactly; or if the left boundary differs and the
right matches; or if the left boundary matches and the
23The pilot data is not included in the gold standard that is
used for the evaluation.
right differs. The improved scores for the lax evalua-
tion listed in Table 2 show that boundary errors signif-
icantly impact on system performance, with an equally
negative effect on recall and precision.
Table 2 also gives inter-annotator agreement (IAA)
scores for 25% of the gold standard. IAA was calcu-
lated by comparing the markup of Annotator 1 with
a second annotator (Annotator 2) for the same data.
The strict and lax scores show that IAA is not par-
ticularly high (F=0.72 and F=0.80) for a task that we
expected to be fairly easy and that boundary errors
are also one of the reasons for the disagreement, al-
beit not to such a large extent as in the system evalu-
ation. After having carried out some error analysis of
the double-annotation, we realised that Annotator 2 had
not completely understood our definition of commodity
and had mistakenly included machinery and tools (e.g.,
scissors) as well as general terms related to commodi-
ties (e.g., produce). Annotator 2 also missed several
relevant commodity mentions which Annotator 1 had
correctly identified. For these reasons, Annotator 2’s
markup was ignored when evaluating the text mining
output.

4.2 Analysis and Lexicon Modification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953565217391">
When examining the output of the text mining pro-
totype, we found that it had identified a total of
31,169,104 commodity mentions (tokens) across all
five collections. However, these corresponded to only
5,841 different commodity terms (types). Since the
Trading Consequences thesaurus contains 20,476 com-
modity terms, only 28.5% of the content in the lexicon
corresponds to identifiable commodity mentions in the
text. The top 1,757 most frequent commodity terms
occur at least 100 times in our data; they make up a to-
tal of 31,113,978 commodity mentions in the text and
therefore amount to 99.8% of all commodity mentions
found. Figure 10 presents the average frequency dis-
tribution of different commodity terms (separated into
bins) across all text collections.
The difference between the strict and lax bound-
ary evaluations described above provide evidence that
some of the commodity mentions in text were sub-
strings of commodity terms in the lexicon (e.g., seal
vs. sealskins) and vice versa. A detailed error analysis
showed that incorrect and missing entries in the lexicon
further decrease precision and recall, respectively, and
OCR errors occurring in the commodity terms in the

text also considerably reduce recall (Alex and Burns,
to appear). In our gold standard, 9.1% (101 of 1,107)
of all manually annotated commodity mentions contain
one or more OCR errors. In order to improve the accu-
racy of the lexicon, we carried out three modifications,
which are described below.
Step (i): Removal of errors from lexicon All com-
modity terms below that of rank 1,757 (in bin 1,701–
1,800 and subsequent bins) have a frequency of less
than 100. In Trading Consequences we are particularly
interested in frequently occurring commodities as we
aim to identify trends in trade. Consequently one of
the authors of this paper (an environmental historian)
manually checked the correctness of the top 1,757 com-
modity terms. 84 of them (4.8%) were considered to be
errors (either real errors, OCR errors, commodities out-
side our scope, or overly-ambiguous terms) and were
therefore deleted from the lexicon.
We then tested the effect this change had on the per-
formance for against the gold standard. The scores in
Table 3 show that step (i), deleting incorrect entries
from the lexicon, has an expected positive effect on
precision, which increased by 0.06 (to P=0.65). It also
resulted in a small decrease in recall since Annotator
1 had marked several instances of the word bread as
commodity mentions, which is arguably at the bound-
ary of our definition of ‘natural resources or lightly
processed commodities’. He had also annotated pa-
per and linen as commodity mentions, which are not
within our definition. Eliminating incorrect terms from
lexicon does not reduce the number of boundary er-
rors made by the prototype, and consequently the lax
boundary evaluation still results in an increase of 0.16
in F-score compared to the strict evaluation (F=0.59
versus F=0.75), the same as is the case for the proto-
type.
Step (ii): Context rules Having examined the
boundary errors made by the prototype, we also applied
rules to extend commodity mentions to the left or right
in certain contexts. We shift a boundary to the left if a
recognised commodity mention is preceded by a noun
or proper noun starting with an uppercase letter or if
it is preceded by another commodity mention. This
boundary shift is carried out to capture noun phrases
in which the recognised commodity mention is a head
noun which is then specified further by its immediate
left context (e.g., coffee is extended to Liberica coffee
or oil is combined with coconut to yield coconut oil).
We shift a boundary to the right in the case where a
recognised commodity is followed by the word tree or
trees (e.g., palm trees). We tested the effect of apply-
ing these context rules to the prototype (see step (ii)
in Table 3). While this post-processing step decreases
precision very slightly, recall increases by 0.4.

Figure 10: Average frequency distribution of different
commodity terms split into bins of size 100. The Trad-
ing Consequences data contains a total of 5,841 differ-
ent commodity terms. The graph is capped at the most
frequent 2,000 terms as it would otherwise show a long
invisible tail of very low average frequencies.
Step (iii): Bigram-based additions Finally, we con-
ducted a frequency-based bigram analysis for a set of
trade-related terms like import, export, farm, planta-
tion of the text-mined collections (see an example in
Figure 11). We manually examined frequently occur-
ring left and right contexts of such words with the aim
of identifying a list of terms for commodities of im-
portance in the nineteenth century but which were not
already contained in the lexicon and were therefore
missed by the text mining. We identified a list of 294
commodity terms (including plural forms and spelling
variants) which we added to the lexicon. Step (iii) in
Table 3 shows that this change increases recall by 0.05
and precision by 0.01. When combining steps (i)–(iii),
we obtain the highest overall F-score of 0.62 with the
strict evaluation.

5 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.999724209302326">
In many named entity recognition tasks, there is rea-
sonable agreement in advance about the ontological
scope of a given class. For example, when identify-
ing mentions of people, locations, companies or dates
in a corpus, we are not in doubt as to what consti-
tutes these classes. By contrast, in the Trading Conse-
quences project, our goal was precisely to gain a better
understanding of what counted as a traded commod-
ity during the nineteenth century. In other words, we
were not only bootstrapping a lexicon, but were also
trying to bootstrap the ontological class ‘commodity’
that was true for a specific time period. Given a small
number of clear cases extracted from customs records,
we used the categorial similarity of other entities to our

the lexicon.
seed set as means of extrapolating to a much larger set
of candidate commodities. However, it is only when
these candidates can be found as mentions in our cor-
pus that we gain confidence in the belief that we really
have identified new commodities. From the perspective
of historical inquiry, progressing from around a dozen
or so well-studied commodities in nineteenth century
trade to around 2,000 is a significant step forward.
The process of sibling acquisition via SPARQL query
to DBpedia is a novel contribution, as far as we are
aware, and we have argued that it can help to gener-
ate a lexicon which can be used as part of standard
techniques in natural language processing. Although
computational linguists are still relatively unfamiliar
with RDF as a data model, we believe that its flexibility
make it well suited to capturing the combination of lex-
ical and encyclopaedic knowledge that is central to the
digital history research described here. In addition, by
basing our concepts on DBpedia, the ‘linking’ aspect of
Linked Data (Heath and Bizer, 2011) gives us the po-
tential to connect our commodity thesaurus to a wealth
of other sources of knowledge about commodities.

Both these steps were carried out manually.16 For obvious reasons, we wanted as far as possible to use an existing ontology as a source of concepts.

For example, it ought be possible to group together limes, apples and oranges within a common category (or hypernym) such as Fruit. Third, we wanted the freedom to add arbitrary attributes to terms, such as noting that both nuts and whales are a source of oil. These considerations argued in favour of a framework that had more structure than a simple list of terms, but was more like a thesaurus than a dictionary or linguistically-organised lexicon.12 This made SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System—Miles and Bechhofer (2009)) an obvious choice for organising the thesaurus. SKOS assumes that the ‘hierarchical backbone’ of the thesaurus is organised around concepts. These are semantic rather than linguistic entities, and serve as the hooks to which lexical labels are attached. SKOS employs the Resource Description Framework (RDF)13 as a representation language; in particular, SKOS concepts are identified by URIs. Every concept has a unique ‘preferred’ (or canonical) lexical label (expressed by the property skos:prefLabel), plus any number of alternative lexical labels (expressed by the property skos:altLabel).

However it is obviously a very incomplete list of commodities, and by itself would give us poor recall in identifying commodity mentions. Many kinds of product in the Customs Ledgers included open ended subcategories (i.e., Oil - Seed Unenumerated or Fruit - Unenumerated Dried).

While prior historical research into commodity flows (Cronon, 1991; Cushman, 2013; Innis and Drache, 1995; McCook, 2006; Tully, 2009) has focused on a small number of widely traded natural resources, the large corpora of digitised documents processed by Trading Consequences is giving historians data about a much broader range of commodities. A detailed appraisal of trade in these resources will yield a significantly more accurate picture of globalisation and its environmental consequences. In this paper we focus on our approach to building a lexicon to support the recognition of commodity terms in text. We provide some background to this work in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the process of creating the lexicon; this </context>

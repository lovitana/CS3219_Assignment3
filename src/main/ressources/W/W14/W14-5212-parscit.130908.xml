The EUMSSI project (Event Understanding through Multimodal Social Stream Interpretation)
aims at developing technologies for aggregating data presented as unstructured information in
sources of very different nature. The multimodal analytics will help organize, classify and clus-
ter cross-media streams, by enriching its associated metadata in an interactive manner, so that
the data resulting from analysing one media helps reinforce the aggregation of information from
other media, in a cross-modal semantic representation framework. Once all the available de-
scriptive information has been collected, an interpretation component will dynamically reason
over the semantic representation in order to derive implicit knowledge. Finally the enriched in-
formation will be fed to a hybrid recommendation system, which will be at the basis of two
well-motivated use-cases. In this paper we give a brief overview of EUMSSI’s main goals and
how we are approaching its implementation using UIMA to integrate and combine various layers
of annotations coming from different sources.

Nowadays, a multimedia journalist has access to avast amount of data from a plurality of types of sources
to document a story. In order to put information into context and tell his story from all significant angles,
he needs to go through an enormous amount of records with information of very diverse degrees of
granularity. At the same time, he needs to reduce the noise of irrelevant content. This is extremely
time-consuming, especially when a topic or event is interconnected with multiple entities from different
domains. At a different level, many TV viewers are getting used to navigating with their tablets or iPads
while watching the TV, the tablet effectively functioning as a second screen, often providing background
information on the program or interaction in social networks about what is being watched. Both the

journalist and the TV viewer would greatly benefit from a system capable of automatically analysing and
interpreting unstructured multimedia data stream and its social background, and, with this understanding,
be able of contextualising the data, and contributing with new, related information.
The FP7-ICT-2013-10 STREP project EUMSSI, which started in December 2013, is developing
methodologies and techniques for identifying and aggregating data presented as unstructured informa-
tion in sources of very different nature (video, image, audio, speech, text and social context), including
both online (e.g., YouTube) and traditional media (e.g. audiovisual repositories), and for dealing with
information of very different degrees of granularity.
This will be accomplished thanks to the integration in a UIMA-based1 multimodal platform of state-
of-the-art information extraction and analysis techniques from the different fields involved (image, audio,
text and social media analysis). The multimodal interpretation platform, in an optimized process chain,
will analyze a vast amount of multimedia content, aggregate all the resulting information and semanti-
cally enrich it with additional metadata layers. The resulting system will be potentially useful for any
application in need of cross-media data analysis and interpretation, such as intelligent content manage-
ment, recommendation, real time event tracking, content filtering, etc. In particular, the EUMSSI project
will use the semantically enriched information to make personalized content-based recommendation.

2 Multimodal analytics and Semantic Enrichment
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999765961538462">
For reasoning with and about the multimedia data, the EUMSSI platform needs to recognize entities,
such as actors, places, topics, dates and genres. A core idea is that the process of integrating information
coming from different media sources is carried out in an interactive manner, so that the metadata resulting
from analyzing one media helps reinforce the aggregation of information from other media. For example,
the quality of speech recognition heavily depends on the audio quality and background noise. Existing
text, tags and other metadata will be exploited for disambiguation. Further, OCR on video data, speech
analysis and speaker recognition mutually reinforce one another. The combined and integrated results of
the audio, video and text analysis will significantly enhance the existing metadata, which can be used for
retrieval and recommendation. In addition, the extracted entities and other annotations will be exploited
for identifying specific video fragments in which a particular person speaks, a new topic begins, or an
entity is mentioned. Figure 1 illustrates some of the different layers of analysis that may exist for a video
content item.
Once the entities and concepts have been identified in the different modalities, all the information is ag-
gregated and semantically enriched, using general ontologies or structured knowledge bases. Wikipedia
categories have been successfully exploited with this purpose in different works: e.g. to describe chemi-
cal documents (K¨ohncke and Balke, 2010), to identify topics of interest for Twitter users (Michelson and
Macskassy, 2010), and also to improve Web video categorization (Chen et al., 2010). Moreover, (Hahn et
al., 2010) have shown that the structured information gathered from Wikipedia infoboxes can be used to
answer complex questions, like “Which Rivers flow into the Rhine and are longer than 50 kilometers?”
For this purpose, text documents need to be previously annotated using DBpedia Spotlight (Mendes et
al., 2011), which automatically annotates text with links to articles in Wikipedia. The process of se-
mantic enrichment is still largely domain-dependent; therefore, apart from the available general-purpose
knowledge bases and ontologies (DBpedia, FOAF, DublinCore...), the EUMSSI platform needs special-
ized resources for categorizing videos on different dimensions. Linked Data technologies (Heath and
Bizer, 2011) and the Linked Open Data cloud2 provide access to several of these resources, including
geodata, movie databases and program information.

3 Content-based Recommendation and the Demonstrators

<bodyText confidence="0.999934">
The semantically enriched information is then used by the EUMSSI system to make personalized
content-based recommendation. We propose a novel recommender system that leverages matrix factor-
ization (Koren, 2008) with implicit feedback in order to integrate content-based similarity, usage history

(i.e. collaborative filtering), as well as user demographics. This integrated approach reduces the cold-
start problems typical of collaborative filtering, both for new users and for new content. Recommendation
and aggregation of related content in EUMSSI is expected to use varying degrees of personalization, giv-
ing more weight in some cases to the individual user’s interests, based on his viewing history, but being
based primarily on the similarity to the currently shown content in other cases.
On top of the recommender, two demonstrators will be implemented within the EUMSSI project, each
catering to a different use-case: (i) a computer-assisted storytelling tool integrated in the workflow of a
multimedia news editor, empowering the journalist to monitor and gather up-to-date documents related
with his investigation, without the need of reviewing an enormous amount of insufficiently annotated
records; and (ii) a second-screen application for an end-user, able to make relevant suggestions of mul-
timedia content based on what the user is watching, what other people have watched, and what people
are saying about these contents in the social networks. Figure 2 shows how both applications build on a
common base of multimedia analysis and content aggregation/recommendation algorithms.

<bodyText confidence="0.9996644">
All new content coming into the system is first normalized to a common metadata schema (based on
schema.org) and stored in a database (MAM/media asset manager, or MongoDB3) to make it available
for further processing. Analysis results, as well as the original metadata, are stored in CAS format to
allow integration of different aligned layers of analysis.
The process flow, pictured in Figure 3, can be summarized as follows:

5 Aligned data representation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993222">
Much of the reasoning and cross-modal integration depends on an aligned view of the different annotation
layers, e.g., in order to connect person names detected from OCR with corresponding speakers from the
speaker recognition component, or faces detected by the face recognition.
The Apache UIMA4 CAS (common analysis structure) representation is a good fit for the needs of the
EUMSSI project as it has a number of interesting characteristics:

• Annotations are stored “stand-off”, meaning that the original content is not modified in any way by
adding annotations. Rather, the annotations are entirely separate and reference the original content
by offsets

• Annotations can be defined freely by defining a “type system” that specifies the types of anno-
tations (such as Person, Keyword, Face, etc.) and the corresponding attributes (e.g. dbpediaUrl,
canonicalRepresentation, ...)
• Source content can be included in the CAS (particularly for text content) or referenced as external
content via URIs (e.g. for multimedia content)
• While each CAS represents one “document” or “content item”, it can have several Views that rep-
resent different aspects of that item, e.g. the video layer, audio layer, metadata layer, transcribed
text layer, etc., with separate source content (SofA or “subject of annotation”) and separate sets of
annotations
• CASes can be passed efficiently in-memory between UIMA analysis engines
• CASes can be serialized in a standardised OASIS format5 for storage and interchange
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996815058823529">
In the case of the EUMSSI project, the common base for alignment for different annotation layers
referring to multimedia content is timestamps relative to the original content.
Annotations based directly on multimedia content (video and audio) will naturally refer to that content
via timestamps, whereas text analysis modules normally work with character offsets relative to the text
content. It is therefore fundamental that any textual views created from multimedia content (e.g. via ASR
or OCR) refer back to the timestamps in the original content. This will be done by creating annotations,
e.g. tokens, that include the original timestamps as attributes in addition to the character offsets.
As an example, we may have a CAS with an audio view on which we apply automatic speech recogni-
tion (ASR), providing the transcription as a series of tokens/words with a timestamp for each word. The
system then creates a new view in the CAS that has the full plain-text transcription as SofA and a series
of Token annotations with both character offsets relative to the plain-text SofA, and timestamp offsets
relative to the multimedia content.
In this way it is possible to apply standard text analysis modules (that rely on character offsets) on the
textual representation, while maintaining the possibility to later map the resulting annotations back onto
the temporal scale.
Timestamps will be represented in milliseconds in order to avoid floating point values. In this way, all
annotations can be subtypes of the standard UIMA Annotation type6, which provides access to a number

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998313625">
of utility functions that help find sets of overlapping annotations, retrieve annotations in offset order, etc.
SofA-aware UIMA components are able to work on multiple views, whereas “normal” analysis en-
gines only see one specific view that is presented to them. This means that e.g. standard text analysis
engines don’t need to be aware that they are being applied to an ASR view or an OCR view; they just
see a regular text document. SofA-aware components, however, can explicitly work on annotations from
different views and can therefore be used to integrate and combine the information coming from different
sources or layers, and create new, integrated views with the output from that integration and reasoning
process.

6 Flow management
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999865351351352">
UIMA provides a platform for execution of analysis components (Analysis Engines or AEs), as well as
for managing the flow between those components.
CPE or uimaFIT7 (Ogren and Bethard, 2009) can be used to design and execute pipelines made up of a
sequence of AEs (and potentially some more complex flows), and UIMA-AS8 (Asynchronous Scaleout)
permits the distribution of the process among various machines or even a cluster (with the help of UIMA
DUCC9).
Analysis Engines can either be “natively” written for UIMA or can be wrappers that translate inputs
and outputs for existing analysis components so they can be integrated in UIMA. All text analysis com-
ponents, as well as the integration and reasoning components, will be available as UIMA AEs and can
therefore be configured and executed directly within the UIMA environment.
There are some components of the EUMSSI platform, however, that do not integrate easily in this
fashion. This is the case of computationally expensive processes that are optimized for batch execution.
A UIMA AE needs to expose a process() method that operates on a single CAS (= document), and is
therefore not compatible with batch processing. This is particularly true for processes that need to be run
on a cluster, with significant startup overhead, such as many video and audio analysis tasks.
It is therefore necessary to have an alternative flow mechanism for offline or batch processes, which
needs to integrate with the processing performed within the UIMA environment.
The main architectural and integration issues revolve around the data flow, rather than the computa-
tion. In fact, the computationally complex and expensive aspects are specific to the individual analysis
components, and should not have an important impact on the design of the overall platform.
As such, the design of the flow management is presented in terms of transformations between data
states, rather than from the procedural point of view. The resulting system should only rely on the
robustness of those data states to ensure the reliability and robustness of the overall system, protecting
against potential problems from server failures or other causes. At any point, the system should be able
to resume its function purely from the state of the persisted data.
To ensure reliability and performance of the data persistence, we expect to use a well-established and
widely used database system such as MongoDB.
Figure 4 shows the general flow of the EUMSSI system, focusing on the data states needed for the
system to function.
In order to avoid synchronization issues, the state of the data processing is stored together with the
data, and the list of pending tasks can be extracted at any point through simple database queries.
For example in order to retrieve the list of content items that have been crawled or received from feeds,
but still need to be converted to the unified EUMSSI schema, it is sufficient to query for items that have
a “source meta:original” but no “source meta:eumssi”.
Similarly, the queues for analysis processes can be constructed directly from the “processing state” of
an item by selecting (for a given queue) all items that have not yet been processed by that queue and that
fulfil all prerequisites (dependencies).

• XMI CAS is the CAS serialized in XMI format (and possibly compressed)
• BINARY CAS is the CAS serialized in binary format (alternative to XMI CAS)
• METADATA FROM CAS is metadata that is generated by EUMSSI analysis processes, using the
EUMSSI schema
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872619047619">
Normally, the CAS will be stored only in one of the available formats, but potentially different serial-
izations could be used. The “extracted meta” information can be used for analysis results that are used
as inputs to other annotators (such as detected Named Entities as input to speech recognition), to avoid
the overhead of extracting that information from the CAS on demand.
MongoDB allows to stored structured information (corresponding to a JSON structure), so that the
content of fields like ORIGINAL SOURCE METADATA can reflect whatever internal structure the orig-
inal data had.
The final applications are not expected to use the information stored in MongoDB directly, but rather
access Solr indexes created from that information to respond specifically to the types of queries needed
by the applications. Those indexes will typically be created from the CAS when all analysis steps have
been performed.
It is, however, possible to have indexing processes that only depend on a subset of analyses, and thus
make content items (at least partially) accessible to the applications before they have been fully processed
(which may take a relatively long time). The indexing processes can be managed in the same way as any
analysis process, with their own queues that specify the necessary dependencies, and taking the current
state of the CAS as input.
In its simplest form, the processes responsible for the data transitions are fully independent and poll
the database periodically to retrieve pending work. Those processes can then be implemented in any
language that can communicate comfortably with MongoDB. As an efficiency improvement, in order
to reduce the polling load, message queues (such as managed by ActiveMQ10) can be used to notify
processes of pending work after performing the preceding steps.

7 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999602">
In this paper, we have presented the main goals and approaches of the EUMSSI project, which aims
to innovatively integrate state-of-the-art text and A/V analysis technologies, semantic enrichment and
reasoning, social intelligence and collaborative content-based recommendation, in order to build a mul-
timodal, interoperable platform potentially useful for any application in need of automatic cross-media
data analysis and interpretation, such as intelligent content management, personalized recommendation,
real time event tracking, content filtering, etc.
The project is still in an early stage, and many aspects will need to be defined later on. The different
analysis modalities are handled by separate research groups that will each improve the individual types of
analysis in their are of expertise. This paper only reports on the platform that will integrate and combine
the analysis results.
Additionally, possible interactions between modalities will need to be defined as it becomes clearer
what information each analysis can provide or benefit from. We have at this point identified some of the
more obvious interactions, such as doing text analysis on speech recognition output, or adding Named
Entities from surrounding text to the vocabulary known to the ASR system, but many more may become
apparent as the different research groups learn from each other.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.844258">

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996135">
One of the main innovative aspects of the project also lies in the combination of the outputs of different
analysis layers, and the capacity to perform reasoning or inference over this combined view to create a
richer model of the content than can be obtained individually. This is an important research task that
has not started yet, and we hope to report on it in the near future. As such, this article is limited to the
technological foundation that will enable this work by providing a flexible platform with easy access to
all available information layers.
Development of the platform has recently begun and all developments will become publicly available

<abstract confidence="0.999652461538461">The EUMSSI project (Event Understanding through Multimodal Social Stream Interpretation) aims at developing technologies for aggregating data presented as unstructured information in sources of very different nature. The multimodal analytics will help organize, classify and cluster cross-media streams, by enriching its associated metadata in an interactive manner, so that the data resulting from analysing one media helps reinforce the aggregation of information from other media, in a cross-modal semantic representation framework. Once all the available descriptive information has been collected, an interpretation component will dynamically reason over the semantic representation in order to derive implicit knowledge. Finally the enriched information will be fed to a hybrid recommendation system, which will be at the basis of two well-motivated use-cases. In this paper we give a brief overview of EUMSSI’s main goals and how we are approaching its implementation using UIMA to integrate and combine various layers of annotations coming from different sources.</abstract>

SofA-aware components, however, can explicitly work on annotations from different views and can therefore be used to integrate and combine the information coming from different sources or layers, and create new, integrated views with the output from that integration and reasoning process. 6 Flow management UIMA provides a platform for execution of analysis components (Analysis Engines or AEs), as well as for managing the flow between those components. CPE or uimaFIT7 (Ogren and Bethard, 2009) can be used to design and execute pipelines made up of a sequence of AEs (and potentially some more complex flows), and UIMA-AS8 (Asynchronous Scaleout) permits the distribution of the process among various machines or even a cluster (with the help of UIMA DUCC9). Analysis Engines can either be “natively” written for UIMA or can be wrappers that translate inputs and outputs for existing analysis components so they can be integrated in UIMA. All text analysis components, as well as the integration and reasoning components, will be available as UIMA AEs and can therefore be configured and execu</context>

Implicit opinions are commonly seen in
opinion-oriented documents, such as po-
litical editorials. Previous work have uti-
lized opinion inference rules to detect
implicit opinions evoked by events that
positively/negatively affect entities (good-
For/badFor) to improve sentiment analy-
sis for English text. Since people in differ-
ent languages may express implicit opin-
ions in different ways, in this work we in-
vestigate implicit opinions expressed via
goodFor/badFor events in Chinese. The
positive results have provided evidences
that such implicit opinions and inference
rules are similar in Chinese and in English.
Moreover, we have observed cases where
the inferences are blocked.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997799375">
In the opinion-oriented documents, many opin-
ions are expressed implicitly rather than explicitly.
Consider the following example from (Deng and
Wiebe, 2014):
EX(1.1) The reform would lower
health care costs, which would be a
tremendous positive change across the
entire health-care system.
There is an explicit positive sentiment (positive)
toward the event of reform lower costs. In express-
ing this sentiment, the writer implies he is nega-
tive toward the costs, because he’s happy to see the
costs being decreased. The writer may be positive
toward reform since it conducts the lower event.
Such inferences may be seen as opinion-oriented
implicatures (i.e., defeasible inferences) 1.

We create an annotated corpus (denoted DCW
corpus) (Deng et al., 2013)2 and generalizes such
events, defining a badFor (bf) event to be an
event that negatively affects the object and agood-
For (gf) event to be an event that positively af-
fects the object of the event. Here, lower is a
bf event. According to the annotation scheme,
goodFor/badFor (hereafter gfbf) events have NP
agents and objects (though the agent may be im-
plicit), and the polarity of a gf event may be
changed to bf by a reverser (and vice versa).
We have developed a set of rules for inferring
implicit sentiments, from explicit sentiments and
gfbf events (Deng and Wiebe, 2014). We incor-
porate the rules into a graph-based model, which
significantly improves classifying the sentiments
toward agents and objects in the gfbf events.
The contribution of this work is investigating
implicatures in a second language, specifically in
Chinese. People in different languages may ex-
press implicit opinions in different ways, so it is
better to first assess similarity of implicatures in
the two languages, rather than to directly utilize
the English resources. In this work we conduct an
agreement study for gfbf information in Chinese.
The good agreement scores provide evidence for
the existence of similar implicature in Chinese.
During the analysis of disagreement, we have ob-
served interesting gfbf events triggered by Chinese
syntax, which are rare in English but common in
Chinese. We should provide additional guidance
for such events when developing a Chinese gfbf
manual in the future.
We run the graph-based model on the annotated
Chinese corpus. The good evaluation results sup-
port our hypothesis that the inference rules in En-
glish apply for Chinese. Moreover, we have ob-
served gfbf cases where the sentiment inferences
are blocked, which are similar to what we have
found in English (Wiebe and Deng, 2014).

In addition to researches focusing on explicit sen-
timents (Wiebe et al., 2005; Johansson and Mos-
chitti, 2013; Yang and Cardie, 2013), recently
there are work investigating features that directly
indicate implicit sentiments (Zhang and Liu, 2011;
Feng et al., 2013), or working on inferring implicit
opinions (Choi and Cardie, 2008; Zhang and Liu,
2011; Anand and Reschke, 2010; Reschke and
Anand, 2011; Goyal et al., 2013). Different from
their work, which do not cover all the inferences of
implicit opinions over explicit opinions and gfbf
events, we define a generalized set of inference
rules and incorporate the rules into a graph-based
model to achieve sentiment propagation between
the agents and objects of gfbf events (Deng and
Wiebe, 2014). The result shows that the graph-
based model itself is able to assign the unknown
nodes with correct labels 89% of the time.
Many works in Chinese sentiment analysis de-
velop heuristics for adapting methods in English
to methods appropriate for Chinese (Tsou et al.,
2005; Wang et al., 2007; Li and Sun, 2007). In-
stead of projecting English methods and resources
into Chinese versions, there are also works lever-
aging Chinese-English parallel corpus to assist
Chinese sentiment analysis. Wan (2008) trans-
lates Chinese sentiment sentences into English and
ensemble the sentiment classification results from
both English and Chinese sentiment classifiers.
Wan (2009) adopt co-training methods, utilizing
labeled English sentences and unlabelled Chinese
sentences. Lu et al. (2011) assumes parallel sen-
tences in different languages bear the same sen-
timent. They utilize unlabelled Chinese-English
parallel corpus to jointly improve sentiment clas-
sification in both languages. Boyd-Graber and
Resnik (2010) present a generative model, jointly
modeling topics that are consistent across lan-
guages, to improve sentiment rating predictions.

<bodyText confidence="0.99829384">
The definition of a gfbf event is from (Deng et
al., 2013). A goodFor (gf) event is an event that
positively affects an entity (similarly, for badFor
(bf) events). A gfbf triple has the structure of (
agent, gfbf, object), though the agent can be im-
plicit. For example, in the sentence from (Deng
et al., 2013), “Repealing the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) would hurt our economy.”, there are two
gfbf triples. One is (Repealing the ACA, hurt,
families, our economy), which is a bf. The other
is (implicit, Repealing, the ACA), which is bf and
the agent is implicit. The DCW corpus contains
manually annotated gfbf events, the gfbf polari-
ties, the corresponding agents and objects and the
writer’s attitudes toward the agents and objects.
Because people in different languages may ex-
press their opinions in different ways. In this sec-
tion, we conduct an agreement study for Chinese
gfbf information in Section 3.1 and achieve good
agreement scores, reported in Section 3.2, which
provide supporting evidences for detecting Chi-
nese gfbf events. In the disagreement analysis,
we have observed interesting cases which are gfbf
events in semantics but are triggered by Chinese
own syntax. We explain the cases in Section 3.3.

Data: We collect 100 political editorials from the
Opinion Column in the Chinese version of New
York Times3, where each political editorial has an
English version and a Chinese version. The Chi-
nese editorial is a translated and paraphrased ver-
sion of the corresponding English editorial, writ-
ten by professional translators. The English ver-
sion and the Chinese version are paragraph paral-
leled. In the previous agreement study of (Deng et
al., 2013), the annotators are asked to annotate the
whole document. Because not all the sentences
contain gfbf events and the documents are long,
a large proportion of disagreement we find that is
due to negligence. In order to reduce negligence
and provide a more dense data for annotation, first,
we collect a lexicon of English gfbf words in the
DCW corpus. Then we find the English sentences
containing English gfbf words and select the para-
graphs containing those sentences. The parallel
Chinese paragraphs are collected. Though a para-
graph may contain more than one sentence and
some sentences do not have gfbf events, it is much
more dense to annotate than the document as a
whole. When presenting data to the annotators, we
do not provide an isolated paragraph since it may

the original Chinese editorials and highlight the
selected paragraphs. The annotators are told to
read through the whole document but only need
to annotate the highlighted paragraphs.
Procedure: We adopt our English manual in
(Deng et al., 2013) to train the annotators. The
annotators read through the manual and several
Chinese gfbf examples. Then, the annotators la-
bel several paragraphs and discuss their disagree-
ments to reconcile their differences. For the for-
mal agreement study, we randomly selected 60
paragraphs, which have a total of 253 Chinese sen-
tences. These paragraphs are different from the
paragraphs discussed during training. The annota-
tors then independently annotated the 60 selected
paragraphs.

We use the same measurement for agreement for
all types of spans. (The type is either gfbf, agent,
or object). Suppose A is a set of annotations of
a particular type and B is the set of annotations
of the same type from the other annotator. For
any text span a ∈ A and b ∈ B, the span cov-
erage c counts the percentage of overlapping Chi-
nese characters between a and b,

where |a |is the number of characters in span a,
and ∩ gives the set of characters that two spans
have in common (Johansson and Moschitti, 2013).
Following (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003), we treat
each set A and B in turn as the gold-standard and
calculate the average F-measure (agr(A, B)).

which the annotators agree, we use n (Artstein
and Poesio, 2008) to measure agreement for the at-
tributes. We report three n values: one for the po-
larities of the gfbf events, and the other two for the
writer’s attitudes toward the agents and objects.
Three annotator participate in the agreement
study. All of them are Chinese graduate students
studying in US. One of them is the co-author
of this work (Anno 1), while the other two do

(Anno2, Anno3). Since Anno1 is familiar with this
work, we compare the other two’s annotations to
Anno1’s. In Table 1, the upper half is the agree-
ment for span overlapping (agr(A, B)), and the
lower half is the agreement for attribute (n).
The result have shown that the annotators have
good agreement scores, though our training period
is not long and our training data cover multiple
topics. In particular, the annotators agree quite
well on recognizing the agents and objects and
judging the polarity of gfbf events.
For recognizing gfbf events, we have found two
interesting gfbf cases caused by the Chinese syn-
tax that is different from English, elaborated in the
next section. Among the spans only one annota-
tor marks, one third is due to the two cases above;
one third are borderlines that could be marked; one
third are incorrect. For the spans two annotator
mark but the third doesn’t, we regard it as negli-
gence.
For judging the writer’s attitudes toward agents
and objects, we can see from Table 1 that Anno 2
and Anno 3 behave differently. This is understand-
able because we are marking the implicit opinions
of the writer. Though trained, different annotators
have different thresholds for judging whether an
opinion is expressed here. Some annotators may
be more sensitive than the others. If we don’t
count the spans that one annotator marks it as none
(i.e. neutral) but the other doesn’t, the n scores in-
crease a lot, as Row Polar shows in Table 2. This
indicates that the annotators mainly disagree on
whether the sentiment is neutral or not, rather than
the polarity of opinions.
To further investigate whether the disagreement
is caused by Chinese, or is due to the annotators’
inherent different sensitivities of opinions, we ran-
domly select 5 documents from the DCW corpus,
delete the writer’s attitude toward agents and ob-
jects but keep the remaining annotations. The an-

Row Eng in Table 2 shows, we have got consis-
tent agreement results within the same annotators

This supports the idea that the differences between
the annotators are differences on the underlying
task, regardless of the language.

3.3 GoodFor/Badfor Triggered by Chinese
Syntax
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999912258064516">
During the analysis of disagreement, we have
found gfbf cases which are triggered by the Chi-
nese syntax that is different from English. Since
the annotators are trained by the English manual,
some annotators stay consistent with the English
syntax, but the others go beyond syntax and iden-
tify gfbf according to semantics and pragmatics,
which lead to disagreement. In this section we list
two major cases due to the Chinese own syntax.
This suggests that additional guidance to annotate
such cases should be added to the English manual
to develop a Chinese gfbf manual.
The first case is due to unclear expression of
passive voice in Chinese. In English, the noun
phrase that would be the object of an active sen-
tence (Our troops defeated the enemy) appears as
the subject of a sentence with passive voice (The
enemy was defeated by our troops)4. It is clear
that enemy is the object and our troops is the agent
in both sentences. However, this is not intuitive
for some Chinese sentences.
A Chinese example is “ 经济潜力似乎得U释
放 ”, whose English translation is: “The economic
potential ... appeared to be unleashed”. A word-
to-word translation would be “...appeared to have
got unleashed”. In the two English versions, po-
tential is obviously the object of unleashed event.
However, some annotators analyze this sentence
according to syntax5. The dependency syntax be-
tween the object potential (潜力) and the gfbf un-
leash (释放) is nsubj(释放-5, 潜力-2) so it is not
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.997015">

5We use Stanford’s dependency parser in this work.
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.999864289473684">
marked. Some annotators view from pragmatics
and read as a passive voice. Since there is no word
transformation of Chinese verbs for passive voice
(e.g. unleash changes to unleashed in English),
this raises disagreement.
The other case is related to one constraint de-
fined in (Deng et al., 2013). According to the
manual, the polarity of a gfbf triple must be de-
termined within the triple. As explained in the
manual, in the sentence “Tom has left his cousin
a big trouble”, the triple (Tom, left, his cousin) is
not a gfbf event, since we cannot judge whether
this event is good for or bad for his cousin without
knowing what Tom leaves to his cousin. While
in the sentence “They decrease the manufacturing
costs”, the event decrease is a bf no matter how
many or by what means the costs are decreased.
However, a Chinese instance is, “把改*置于
死地 ”, whose translation is “put the reform to
die”. Whether the event put (把) is good for or bad
for the object reform (改*), depends on whether
the agent puts the reform to die or puts the reform
to revive, for instance. However, in Chinese, 把
is not main verb (Li and Thompson, 1989), the
object (改*, reform) of the main verb (置于死
地, die) is placed after the function word (把), and
the verb is placed after the object, forming a sub-
ject–object–verb (SOV) sentence (Chao, 1968)6,
which is defined as ba structure (Chao, 1968; Li
and Thompson, 1989; Sybesma, 1992). Thus, in
Chinese the sentence is read as: “kill the reform”,
which could be seen as a gfbf event. This structure
is very common in Chinese.
In conclusion, there are very similar implica-
tures in Chinese. However, in order to fully study
the gfbf events in Chinese, the manual should
be revised to provide guidance for annotating the
cases mentioned above.

We propose a set of sentiment inference rules and
incorporate them into a graph-based model to con-
duct sentiment propagation among entities (agents
and objects) of gfbf events (Deng and Wiebe,
2014). In Section 4.1, we run this graph-based
model on the Chinese annotations. The positive
results of sentiment propagation support our hy-
pothesis that the inference rules apply for Chinese
as well. Further, we categorize interesting gfbf
cases where the inferences are blocked in Section

ences are similar to what we have found in English
(Wiebe and Deng, 2014).

4.1 Graph-based Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991112">
In the graph-based model, a node represents an en-
tity (agent, or object), and an edge exists between
two nodes if the two entities participate in one or
more gfbf events with each other. Scores on the
nodes represent the explicit sentiments, if any, ex-
pressed by the writer toward the entities. Scores
on the edges are based on constraints derived from
the rules. Loopy Belief Propagation (Pearl, 1982;
Yedidia et al., 2005) is applied to accomplish sen-
timent propagation in the graph. Given a graph
built from manually annotations, an evaluation is
carried out to assess the ability to propagate sen-
timent of the model. In the study, for each sub-
graph (connected component), we assign one of
the nodes in the subgraph with its gold-standard
polarity. Then we run LBP on each node in the
subgraph. The experiment is run on the subgraph
|S |times, where |S |is the number of nodes in
the subgraph. Therefore, each node is assigned
its gold-standard polarity exactly once, and each
node is given a propagated value |S |− 1 times, as
propagated by each of the other nodes in its sub-
graph. We use Equations (4) and (5) to evaluate
the chance of a node given a correct propagated
label.

Here we run the graph-based model on the Chi-

study, in total 85 paragraphs, 341 sentences and
160 gfbf triples. Later we use this corpus of 160
gfbf triples for analysis (denoted Chinese gfbf cor-
pus). Since the edge scores of the model are de-
fined according to the inference rules, if the senti-
ments are propagated correctly, this is a good evi-
dence that the inference rules apply to Chinese.
The performances of the sentiment propagation
are really good, reported in Table 3. The model
has an 70%-83% chance of propagating senti-
ments correctly in Chinese. This gives us confi-

4.2 Blocking the Inference
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993502794117647">
A wrong propagation indicates the inferences re-
lated to that propagation are blocked. During the
error analysis, we have found three interesting cat-
egories of cases where the inferences are blocked.
Interestingly, we have observed these cases in En-
glish as well (Wiebe and Deng, 2014). In other
words, we didn’t find any blocking case specific to
Chinese. The lower scores of correctness in Chi-
nese might be due to the smaller amount of exper-
iment data and more blocking cases in this corpus.
Irrealis: This category contains gfbf events that
haven’t or will not happen. One of the case is
when the agent tried to conduct the gfbf event,
but failed. In Ex(4.1), the agent and objective are
underlined and the gfbf event is boldfaced. By
the rules, the writer has the same sentiment to-
ward the agents and objects in gf events and op-
posite sentiments toward the agents and objects in
bf events (Deng and Wiebe, 2014). In Ex(4.1), the
writer is negative toward both the agent and the
object, though this is a bf event. This is because
the event counter does not exist due to the failure,
which is implied by intended to. The inferences
for gfbf events in this category are blocked be-
cause the writer expresses the sentiments toward
entities based on what they have done so far.
EX(4.1) ...monetary policy activism in-
tended to counter the cyclical bumps
and grinds of the free market.
Forced GFBF: This category contains gfbf events
whose agents don’t intend to do that or be-
ing forced to conduct the event. For exam-
ple, in Ex(4.2), though the triple (Obama, delay,
mandate) is an event which does not happen, it
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997191">

<bodyText confidence="0.999575512195122">
is different from Ex(4.1). Here, the agent Obama
is forced to conduct the delaying, though he does
not want to and the writer does not blame him
if he does so. For the entities involved in forced
events, (at least the writer believes the entities are
involuntary,) the forced event will not affect the
writer’s sentiments toward the entities so that the
inferences are blocked.
EX(4.2) Some of them even seem to
think that they can bully Mr. Obama into
delaying the individual mandate too.
Quoted GFBF: This category contains gfbf
events in the quotations. Consider the Ex(4.3),
where one of the gfbf triple is (law, reduce,
amount of labor ). In the original editorial, the
writer supports the law and the writer has a posi-
tive sentiment toward the number ofjobs (because
he/she expects to see more job opportunities). But
merely from the annotated gfbf triple, it is inferred
that the law has negative effect since it reduces the
number of jobs. This is not contradictory with the
writer’s stance because the writer regards the event
as a deliberate misreading he/she doesn’t believe.
The actual agent of the event should be (misread-
ing, Obama). This example shows that inferences
of a triple in the quotation are blocked, or event
flipped, based on the writer’s sentiment toward the
agent saying the quotation. The agent in a quoted
gfbf is similar to the notion of nested source in
sentiment analysis (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003).
EX(4.3) Some of the job-killer scare
stories are based on a deliberate mis-
reading that estimated the law would
“reduce the amount of labor used in the
economy” by about 800,000 jobs.
In conclusion, the good performance in our pilot
study gives supporting evidence for our hypothe-
sis. That is, the inference rules apply for Chinese.
Moreover, there is no evidence showing that the
cases where the inferences are blocked only hap-
pen in Chinese.

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.995774975">
In this section, we compare the gfbf spans in
the Chinese gfbf corpus and the English version,
to investigate the possibility of deriving a bilingual
gfbf lexicon. Though the Chinese and English ed-
itorials are paragraph paralleled, they are not sen-
tence paralleled, because an English sentence may
be translated into multiple Chinese sentences and
several English sentences may be merged into one
Chinese sentence. Therefore, instead of automatic
word-alignment, we manually pick up the English
parallel spans of the Chinese annotated gfbfs. The
correspondences of Chinese and English spans are
categorized in Table 4. We present pairs of ex-
amples from the Chinese gfbf corpus, beginning
with the original English sentence (Eng), followed
by another English sentence which is the word-by-
word translation of the Chinese sentence (Chi).
Parallel Span: This category contains instances
where the Chinese annotated gfbf spans have
the corresponding translations in the English sen-
tences, and the English spans are also gfbf words.
Chinese Adding GFBF: In the original English
sentence below, its own making is a noun phrase
rather than a gfbf verb used as a noun. However, in
the Chinese version, there is a clear triple, (itself,
makes, a monetary prison). In such case the Chi-
nese version adds a gfbf event into the sentence.
Eng: ...the Fed is domiciled in a monetary prison
of its own making.
Chi: ...the Fed is domiciled in a monetary prison
which itself makes.
Chinese Adding Object: As stated in the manual,
all gfbf triples should have objects. Thus, in the
original sentence below, we will not mark exclu-
sion because the object is implicit. However, the
Chinese version clearly states the object, patients.
Eng: ...no more exclusion based on pre-existing
conditions...
Chi: ...no more exclusion of the patients based on
pre-existing conditions...

<bodyText confidence="0.999681025641026">
English Out Of Triple: Recall from Section 3.3,
the gfbf polarity must be sufficient to perceive the
gfbf polarity within the triple. The (the Fed, get,
unemployment) below cannot be considered as a
gfbf, since whether it is good for or bad for the
unemployment depending on whether it is below
6.5% or up 6.5%, for instance. On the contrary,
the Chinese version uses the word decrease, which
is a bf word, no matter how many percents are
changed.
Eng: If and when the Fed — which now promises
to get unemployment below 6.5%...
Chi: If and when the Fed — which now promises
to decrease the unemployment to 6.5%...
English Neutral: Sometimes the English word
doesn’t have a gfbf meaning but the Chinese word
has one, based on the translator’s interpretation of
the whole editorial, though the triple structures are
the same in English and Chinese versions.
Eng: We’ve had eight decades of increasingly
frenetic monetary policy activism...
Chi: We’ve been insisting increasingly frenetic
monetary policy activism for eight decades...
In the original English sentence, had eight
decades of is hardly regarded as a gfbf word.
However, in the translated version, the word in-
sisting is a gf word. The change of wording intro-
duces a new gfbf event into the sentence.
Paraphrase: There are other cases where the sen-
tences are paraphrased so largely that we cannot
find a corresponding parallel span of the annotated
Chinese span in the original English sentence. A
majority of cases in this category are gfbf events
triggered by the Chinese syntax in Section 3.3.
In conclusion, the percentage of 76.25% in Row
Parallel Span indicates that it is applicable to de-
rive a bilingual gfbf lexicon from a parallel cor-
pus. However, we need to take into consideration
the 23.75% mismatches for higher precision.

5.1 Chinese Reversers
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999873823529412">
The polarity of a gfbf event could be changed by
a reverser (Deng et al., 2013). A common class
of reversers is negation. For example, in the sen-
tence, “the bill will not increase the costs”, the gf
increase is changed to be bf via the negation not.
In this section, we analyze the Chinese reversers.
All of the reversers in the Chinese gfbf corpus
happen to be negations. In the English sentences,
the negations are easily extracted by neg depen-
dency relation. About 50% of the Chinese nega-
tions are linked to the gfbf events via neg as well.
Among this half, there are two negations com-
monly seen. One is T (Not), often labeled as AD
(adverb) in terms of Part-Of-Speech, the other is
没有 (do not have), labeled as VV (verb), shown
below. The negation is underlined and the gfbf
event it negates is boldfaced.
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.891692">
EX(5.1)T/AD 接受/VV 同性恋/NN
EX(5.2)没有/VV *IJ激/VV 贷款/NN
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.992878111111111">
For the other half, the error mostly arises from
segmentations. For the sentence below, though 没
有 (doesn’t have), often labeled as VB, could be
regarded as a complete token, if we segment the
two characters into two independent tokens, the
parse is more similar to the English one. Below
we only list the most relevant part of the parses.
Eng: He does n’t have ability control war budget
Eng dep: neg(have-4, n’t-3), root(ROOT-0, have-
4), dobj(have-4, ability-6)
Chi: t 没 有 ft&amp;quot;M $►J 战j 预算
wrong dep: root(ROOT-0, 没有-2), nsubj( $►J-
4, ft&amp;quot;M-3), dep(没有-2, $►J-4)
correct dep: neg(有-3, 没-2), root(ROOT-0,有-
3), nsubj( $►J-5, ft&amp;quot;M-4)
In conclusion, it is feasible to recognize re-
versers in Chinese but it calls for a suitable word
segmentation as input.

6 Syntax of Agent/Object in Chinese
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999543470588235">
According to (Deng et al., 2013), the agent is the
entity conducting the gfbf event and the object is
the entity that the gfbf event affects. This defini-
tion is very similar to subject and (in)direct ob-
ject in semantic role labeling. Xue and Palmer
(2004) investigate the Chinese semantic role la-
beling. They utilize the PropBank and the con-
stituency parser. However, from a preliminary
analysis of constituency parse, we cannot distin-
guish the agent and object merely from the parse
tree, because the sentences in the editorials are
usually complicated and it is difficult to classify
whether a noun phrase (NP) constituency is agent
or object in terms of its position. Kozhevnikov
and Titov (2013) adopt a model transfer between
different languages using dependency parser. In
our case, the dependency parser has labels such
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997766">
14
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979157894737">
as “nsubj” and “dobj”, which are strong indica-
tions of agents and objects. Thus, we use the
Stanford dependency parser, which has both En-
glish and Chinese parsers, to analyze the syntax
of agents/objects in the gfbf events. We count the
types of dependencies on the path in a dependency
parse between the tokens of agents/objects and the
tokens of gfbf events in the DCW corpus and the
Chinese gfbf corpus.
Among all the dependency types, 19.57% of the
labels between agents and gfbfs are the ones spe-
cially designed for Chinese and 25.82% between
objects and gfbf are the ones specially designed
for Chinese. This indicates there is a consider-
able number of differences in dependency types.
Chang et al. (2009), who create the Chinese
parser, discuss the differences between Chinese
and English types, which are similar to our obser-
vations.
First, there are more nsubj in Chinese for
agents (21.53%) and more dobj in Chinese for ob-
jects (21.59%), compared to English (17.43% and
14.01%), which are easier for the parser to detect.
Second, the most common types specially de-
signed for Chinese are assm, assmod and cpm (in
total 12.23% for agents and 16.14% for objects).
The relations assm is associative marker, assmod
is associative modifier, and cpm is complemen-
tizer. These are defined because of the frequent us-
age of 的 (whose, of) in Chinese. Though there is
not a direct mapping between Chinese and English
dependency types, they are similar to two common
types in English: prep and pobj (together 23.36%
for agents and 31.62% for objects).
Third, there are more rcmod in Chinese than
those in English. There are 7.05% and 6.5% rc-
mod in Chinese agents and objects, respectively.
But there are only 1.7% and 2.16% in English
agents and objects. The type rcomd is a relative
clause modifier. If a verb is used as the modifier
of a noun, it will be labelled rcmod. Instead, En-
glish writers tend to use more adjectives to mod-
ify nouns, which will be labeled amod (4.04% and
4.48%).
Fourth, there are 7.63% and 6.22% punct in
Chinese agents and object, compared to both 0%
in English. In addition, there are 3.36% and 3.31%
conj in English agents and objects. Chang et
al. (2009) explain that English use conjunctions
(conj) to link clauses while Chinese tend to use
punctuation. Another finding in our corpus is that,
translators tend to break down a long English sen-
tence into several Chinese clauses, linked by punc-
tuations.
For the other Chinese types, most of them are
modifiers, which may be grouped with similar En-
glish modifiers.

7 Chinese Explicit Sentiment Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999963">
There are various available resources for Chinese
sentiment analysis, such as sentiment lexicon from
HowNet7, NTU Sentiment Dictionary (NTUSD)
(Ku and Chen, 2007)8 and the sentiment lexi-
con from Tsinghua University (Li and Sun, 2007).
The sentiments recognized from lexicon hits are
explicit, meaning that the writers use sentiment
words to express his/her opinions. These explicit
sentiment results are provided to the graph-based
model as input. Note that the model plays a role
of sentiment inference, instead of directly detect-
ing sentiments from the text. The inferred senti-
ments are implicit, meaning that the writers ex-
press his/her opinions even without using a senti-
ment lexical clue.

8 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926681818182">
In this work we investigate implicit opinions
expressed via goodFor/badFor events in Chinese.
The positive results have provided evidences
that such implicit opinions and inference rules
are similar in Chinese and English. There are
some gfbf events caused by the Chinese syntax,
guidance for which could be added to the current
English manual to develop a Chinese manual.
Moreover, there is no evidence showing that the
blocked inferences only happen in Chinese. We
also assess the feasibility of acquiring components
of gfbf events from Chinese text using current
available resources. In the future, it is promising
to utilize gfbf information to assist sentiment
analysis in Chinese.

In the last section we briefly talk bout the Chinese explicit sentiment analysis. 2 Related Work In addition to researches focusing on explicit sentiments (Wiebe et al., 2005; Johansson and Moschitti, 2013; Yang and Cardie, 2013), recently there are work investigating features that directly indicate implicit sentiments (Zhang and Liu, 2011; Feng et al., 2013), or working on inferring implicit opinions (Choi and Cardie, 2008; Zhang and Liu, 2011; Anand and Reschke, 2010; Reschke and Anand, 2011; Goyal et al., 2013). Different from their work, which do not cover all the inferences of implicit opinions over explicit opinions and gfbf events, we define a generalized set of inference rules and incorporate the rules into a graph-based model to achieve sentiment propagation between the agents and objects of gfbf events (Deng and Wiebe, 2014). The result shows that the graphbased model itself is able to assign the unknown nodes with correct labels 89% of the time.

A goodFor (gf) event is an event that positively affects an entity (similarly, for badFor (bf) events). A gfbf triple has the structure of ( agent, gfbf, object), though the agent can be implicit.

We count the types of dependencies on the path in a dependency parse between the tokens of agents/objects and the tokens of gfbf events in the DCW corpus and the Chinese gfbf corpus. Among all the dependency types, 19.57% of the labels between agents and gfbfs are the ones specially designed for Chinese and 25.82% between objects and gfbf are the ones specially designed for Chinese. This indicates there is a considerable number of differences in dependency types. Chang et al. (2009), who create the Chinese parser, discuss the differences between Chinese and English types, which are similar to our observations. First, there are more nsubj in Chinese for agents (21.53%) and more dobj in Chinese for objects (21.59%), compared to English (17.43% and 14.01%), which are easier for the parser to detect. Second, the most common types specially designed for Chinese are assm, assmod and cpm (in total 12.23% for agents and 16.14% for objects). The relations assm is associative marker, assmod is associative modifier, and cpm is complementizer. These are defined because of the freque</context>

There are 7.05% and 6.5% rcmod in Chinese agents and objects, respectively. But there are only 1.7% and 2.16% in English agents and objects. The type rcomd is a relative clause modifier. If a verb is used as the modifier of a noun, it will be labelled rcmod. Instead, English writers tend to use more adjectives to modify nouns, which will be labeled amod (4.04% and 4.48%). Fourth, there are 7.63% and 6.22% punct in Chinese agents and object, compared to both 0% in English. In addition, there are 3.36% and 3.31% conj in English agents and objects. Chang et al. (2009) explain that English use conjunctions (conj) to link clauses while Chinese tend to use punctuation. Another finding in our corpus is that, translators tend to break down a long English sentence into several Chinese clauses, linked by punctuations. For the other Chinese types, most of them are modifiers, which may be grouped with similar English modifiers. 7 Chinese Explicit Sentiment Analysis There are various available resources for Chinese sentiment analysis, such as sentiment lexicon from HowNet7, NTU Sentiment Dictionary (NTUSD) (Ku and Chen, 2007)8 and the sentiment lexicon from Tsinghua</context>

However, a Chinese instance is, “把改*置于 死地 ”, whose translation is “put the reform to die”. Whether the event put (把) is good for or bad for the object reform (改*), depends on whether the agent puts the reform to die or puts the reform to revive, for instance. However, in Chinese, 把 is not main verb (Li and Thompson, 1989), the object (改*, reform) of the main verb (置于死 地, die) is placed after the function word (把), and the verb is placed after the object, forming a subject–object–verb (SOV) sentence (Chao, 1968)6, which is defined as ba structure (Chao, 1968; Li and Thompson, 1989; Sybesma, 1992). Thus, in Chinese the sentence is read as: “kill the reform”, which could be seen as a gfbf event. This structure is very common in Chinese. In conclusion, there are very similar implicatures in Chinese.

Since people in different languages may express implicit opinions in different ways, in this work we investigate implicit opinions expressed via goodFor/badFor events in Chinese. The positive results have provided evidences that such implicit opinions and inference rules are similar in Chinese and in English. Moreover, we have observed cases where the inferences are blocked. 1 Introduction In the opinion-oriented documents, many opinions are expressed implicitly rather than explicitly. Consider the following example from (Deng and Wiebe, 2014): EX(1.1) The reform would lower health care costs, which would be a tremendous positive change across the entire health-care system. There is an explicit positive sentiment (positive) toward the event of reform lower costs. In expressing this sentiment, the writer implies he is negative toward the costs, because he’s happy to see the costs being decreased. The writer may be positive toward reform since it conducts the lower event. Such inferences may be seen as opinion-oriented implicatures (i.e., defeasible inferences) 1. 1Implicatures “normally accompany the utterances of a given sentence u</context>

Here, lower is a bf event. According to the annotation scheme, goodFor/badFor (hereafter gfbf) events have NP agents and objects (though the agent may be implicit), and the polarity of a gf event may be changed to bf by a reverser (and vice versa). We have developed a set of rules for inferring implicit sentiments, from explicit sentiments and gfbf events (Deng and Wiebe, 2014). We incorporate the rules into a graph-based model, which significantly improves classifying the sentiments toward agents and objects in the gfbf events. The contribution of this work is investigating implicatures in a second language, specifically in Chinese. People in different languages may express implicit opinions in different ways, so it is better to first assess similarity of implicatures in the two languages, rather than to directly utilize the English resources. In this work we conduct an agreement study for gfbf information in Chinese. The good agreement scores provide evidence for </context>

Many works in Chinese sentiment analysis develop heuristics for adapting methods in English to methods appropriate for Chinese (Tsou et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Li and Sun, 2007). Instead of projecting English methods and resources into Chinese versions, there are also works leveraging Chinese-English parallel corpus to assist Chinese sentiment analysis.

However, in order to fully study the gfbf events in Chinese, the manual should be revised to provide guidance for annotating the cases mentioned above. 4 Implicature Inference in Chinese We propose a set of sentiment inference rules and incorporate them into a graph-based model to conduct sentiment propagation among entities (agents and objects) of gfbf events (Deng and Wiebe, 2014). In Section 4.1, we run this graph-based model on the Chinese annotations. The positive results of sentiment propagation support our hypothesis that the inference rules apply for Chinese as well. Further, we categorize interesting gfbf cases where the inferences are blocked in Section 6http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C7%8E construction. 11 4.2. From our observation, the blocking inferences are similar to what we have found in English (Wiebe and Deng, 2014). 4.1 Graph-based Model In the graph-based model, a node represents an entity (agent, or object), and an edge exists between two nodes if th</context>

The performances of the sentiment propagation are really good, reported in Table 3. The model has an 70%-83% chance of propagating sentiments correctly in Chinese. This gives us confidence that the inference rules apply in Chinese and Dataset # subgraph correctness all subgraphs 136 0.7058 multi-node subgraphs 61 0.8251 Table 3: Performance of Graph-Based Model in Chinese. further we can utilize these rules to assist Chinese sentiment analysis. Compared to the scores of correctness reported in (Deng and Wiebe, 2014), which are 0.8874 for all subgraphs and 0.9030 for multi-node subgraphs, our scores are lower. We analyze the reasons for the gap between our scores in Chinese and in English in the next section. 4.2 Blocking the Inference A wrong propagation indicates the inferences related to that propagation are blocked. During the error analysis, we have found three interesting categories of cases where the inferences are blocked. Interestingly, we have observed these cases in English as well (Wiebe and Deng, 2014).

Wan (2009) adopt co-training methods, utilizing labeled English sentences and unlabelled Chinese sentences. Lu et al. (2011) assumes parallel sentences in different languages bear the same sentiment. They utilize unlabelled Chinese-English parallel corpus to jointly improve sentiment classification in both languages. Boyd-Graber and Resnik (2010) present a generative model, jointly modeling topics that are consistent across languages, to improve sentiment rating predictions. 3 Implicature in Chinese The definition of a gfbf event is from (Deng et al., 2013). A goodFor (gf) event is an event that positively affects an entity (similarly, for badFor (bf) events). A gfbf triple has the structure of ( agent, gfbf, object), though the agent can be implicit. For example, in the sentence from (Deng et al., 2013), “Repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would hurt our economy.”, there are two gfbf triples. One is (Repealing the ACA, hurt, families, our economy), which is a bf. The other is (implicit, Repealing, the ACA), which is bf and the agent is implicit. The DCW corpus contains manually annotated gfbf events, the gfbf polarities, the corresponding </context>

We explain the cases in Section 3.3. 3.1 Agreement Study Design Data: We collect 100 political editorials from the Opinion Column in the Chinese version of New York Times3, where each political editorial has an English version and a Chinese version. The Chinese editorial is a translated and paraphrased version of the corresponding English editorial, written by professional translators. The English version and the Chinese version are paragraph paralleled. In the previous agreement study of (Deng et al., 2013), the annotators are asked to annotate the whole document. Because not all the sentences contain gfbf events and the documents are long, a large proportion of disagreement we find that is due to negligence. In order to reduce negligence and provide a more dense data for annotation, first, we collect a lexicon of English gfbf words in the DCW corpus. Then we find the English sentences containing English gfbf words and select the paragraphs containing those sentences. The parallel Chinese paragraphs are collected. Though a paragraph may contain more than one sentence and some sentences do not ha</context>

However, some annotators analyze this sentence according to syntax5. The dependency syntax between the object potential (潜力) and the gfbf unleash (释放) is nsubj(释放-5, 潜力-2) so it is not 4http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English passive voice. 5We use Stanford’s dependency parser in this work. marked. Some annotators view from pragmatics and read as a passive voice. Since there is no word transformation of Chinese verbs for passive voice (e.g. unleash changes to unleashed in English), this raises disagreement. The other case is related to one constraint defined in (Deng et al., 2013). According to the manual, the polarity of a gfbf triple must be determined within the triple. As explained in the manual, in the sentence “Tom has left his cousin a big trouble”, the triple (Tom, left, his cousin) is not a gfbf event, since we cannot judge whether this event is good for or bad for his cousin without knowing what Tom leaves to his cousin. While in the sentence “They decrease the manufacturing costs”, the event decrease is a bf no matter how many or by what means the costs are decreased. However, a Chinese instance is, “把改*置于 死地 ”, whose translation is “put the reform to die”. </context>
<context position="27740" citStr="Deng et al., 2013" startWordPosition="4593" endWordPosition="4596">re other cases where the sentences are paraphrased so largely that we cannot find a corresponding parallel span of the annotated Chinese span in the original English sentence. A majority of cases in this category are gfbf events triggered by the Chinese syntax in Section 3.3. In conclusion, the percentage of 76.25% in Row Parallel Span indicates that it is applicable to derive a bilingual gfbf lexicon from a parallel corpus. However, we need to take into consideration the 23.75% mismatches for higher precision. 5.1 Chinese Reversers The polarity of a gfbf event could be changed by a reverser (Deng et al., 2013). A common class of reversers is negation. For example, in the sentence, “the bill will not increase the costs”, the gf increase is changed to be bf via the negation not. In this section, we analyze the Chinese reversers. All of the reversers in the Chinese gfbf corpus happen to be negations. In the English sentences, the negations are easily extracted by neg dependency relation. About 50% of the Chinese negations are linked to the gfbf events via neg as well. Among this half, there are two negations commonly seen. One is T (Not), often labeled as AD (adverb) in terms of Part-Of-Speech, the ot</context>

Below we only list the most relevant part of the parses.

This definition is very similar to subject and (in)direct object in semantic role labeling. Xue and Palmer (2004) investigate the Chinese semantic role labeling. They utilize the PropBank and the constituency parser. However, from a preliminary analysis of constituency parse, we cannot distinguish the agent and object merely from the parse tree, because the sentences in the editorials are usually complicated and it is difficult to classify whether a noun phrase (NP) constituency is age</context>

For any text span a ∈ A and b ∈ B, the span coverage c counts the percentage of overlapping Chinese characters between a and b, c(a, b) = |a ∩ b |(1) |b| where |a |is the number of characters in span a, and ∩ gives the set of characters that two spans have in common (Johansson and Moschitti, 2013). Following (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003), we treat each set A and B in turn as the gold-standard and calculate the average F-measure (agr(A, B)).

We report three n values: one for the polarities of the gfbf events, and the other two for the writer’s attitudes toward the agents and objects. Three annotator participate in the agreement study.

This definition is very similar to subject and (in)direct object in semantic role labeling. Xue and Palmer (2004) investigate the Chinese semantic role labeling. They utilize the PropBank and the constituency parser. However, from a preliminary analysis of constituency parse, we cannot distinguish the agent and object merely from the parse tree, because the sentences in the editorials are usually complicated and it is difficult to classify whether a noun phrase (NP) constituency is agent or object in terms of its position. Kozhevnikov and Titov (2013) adopt a model transfer between different languages using dependency parser. In our case, the dependency parser has labels such 14 as “nsubj” and “dobj”, which are strong indications of agents and objects. Thus, we use the Stanford dependency parser, which has both English and Chinese parsers, to analyze the syntax of agents/objects in the gfbf events. We count the types of dependencies on the path in a dependency parse between the tokens of agents/objects and the tokens of gfbf events in the DCW corpus and the Chinese gfbf corpus. Among all the dependency types, 19.57% of the labels between a</context>

However, a Chinese instance is, “把改*置于 死地 ”, whose translation is “put the reform to die”. Whether the event put (把) is good for or bad for the object reform (改*), depends on whether the agent puts the reform to die or puts the reform to revive, for instance.

Compared to the scores of correctness reported in (Deng and Wiebe, 2014), which are 0.8874 for all subgraphs and 0.9030 for multi-node subgraphs, our scores are lower. We analyze the reasons for the gap between our scores in Chinese and in English in the next section. 4.2 Blocking the Inference A wrong propagation indicates the inferences related to that propagation are blocked. During the error analysis, we have found three interesting categories of cases where the inferences are blocked. Interestingly, we have observed these cases in English as well (Wiebe and Deng, 2014). In other words, we didn’t find any blocking case specific to Chinese. The lower scores of correctness in Chinese might be due to the smaller amount of experiment data and more blocking cases in this corpus. Irrealis: This category contains gfbf events that haven’t or will not happen. One of the case is when the agent tried to conduct the gfbf event, but failed. In Ex(4.1), the agent and objective are underlined and the gfbf event is boldfaced. By the rules, the writer has the same sentiment toward the agents and objects in gf events and opposite sentiments toward the agents and objects in bf</context>

(The type is either gfbf, agent, or object). Suppose A is a set of annotations of a particular type and B is the set of annotations of the same type from the other annotator. For any text span a ∈ A and b ∈ B, the span coverage c counts the percentage of overlapping Chinese characters between a and b, c(a, b) = |a ∩ b |(1) |b| where |a |is the number of characters in span a, and ∩ gives the set of characters that two spans have in common (Johansson and Moschitti, 2013). Following (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003), we treat each set A and B in turn as the gold-standard and calculate the average F-measure (agr(A, B)). (2) |B| agr(A, B) = agr(A ||B) 2 agr(B||A) (3) Now that we have the sets of annotations on which the annotators agree, we use n (Artstein and Poesio, 2008) to measure agreement for the attributes. We report three n values: one for the polarities of the gfbf events, and the other two for the writer’s attitudes toward the agents and objects. Three annotator participate in the agreement study.

But merely from the annotated gfbf triple, it is inferred that the law has negative effect since it reduces the number of jobs. This is not contradictory with the writer’s stance because the writer regards the event as a deliberate misreading he/she doesn’t believe. The actual agent of the event should be (misreading, Obama). This example shows that inferences of a triple in the quotation are blocked, or event flipped, based on the writer’s sentiment toward the agent saying the quotation. The agent in a quoted gfbf is similar to the notion of nested source in sentiment analysis (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003). EX(4.3) Some of the job-killer scare stories are based on a deliberate misreading that estimated the law would “reduce the amount of labor used in the economy” by about 800,000 jobs. In conclusion, the good performance in our pilot study gives supporting evidence for our hypothesis. That is, the inference rules apply for Chinese. Moreover, there is no evidence showing that the cases where the inferences are blocked only happen in Chinese. 5 Chinese GoodFor/BadFor Lexicon Above all we have assessed the similarity of implicatures and inference rules in Chinese and English.

This definition is very similar to subject and (in)direct object in semantic role labeling. Xue and Palmer (2004) investigate the Chinese semantic role labeling. They utilize the PropBank and the constituency parser. However, from a preliminary analysis of constituency parse, we cannot distinguish the agent and object merely from the parse tree, because the sentences in the editorials are usually complicated and it is difficult to classify whether a noun phrase (NP) constituency is agent or object in terms of its position. Kozhevnikov and Titov (2013) adopt a model transfer between different languages using dependency parser. In our case, the dependency parser has labels such 14 as “nsubj” and “dobj”, wh</context>

From our observation, the blocking inferences are similar to what we have found in English (Wiebe and Deng, 2014). 4.1 Graph-based Model In the graph-based model, a node represents an entity (agent, or object), and an edge exists between two nodes if the two entities participate in one or more gfbf events with each other. Scores on the nodes represent the explicit sentiments, if any, expressed by the writer toward the entities. Scores on the edges are based on constraints derived from the rules. Loopy Belief Propagation (Pearl, 1982; Yedidia et al., 2005) is applied to accomplish sentiment propagation in the graph. Given a graph built from manually annotations, an evaluation is carried out to assess the ability to propagate sentiment of the model. In the study, for each subgraph (connected component), we assign one of the nodes in the subgraph with its gold-standard polarity. Then we run LBP on each node in the subgraph. The experiment is run on the subgraph |S |times, where |S |is the number of nodes in the subgraph. Therefore, each node is assigned its gold-standard polarity exactly once, and each node is given a propagated value |S |− 1 tim</context>

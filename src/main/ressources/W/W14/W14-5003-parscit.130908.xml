We explore the use of crowdsourcing to
generate natural language in spoken dia-
logue systems. We introduce a method-
ology to elicit novel templates from the
crowd based on a dialogue seed corpus,
and investigate the effect that the amount
of surrounding dialogue context has on the
generation task. Evaluation is performed
both with a crowd and with a system de-
veloper to assess the naturalness and suit-
ability of the elicited phrases. Results indi-
cate that the crowd is able to provide rea-
sonable and diverse templates within this
methodology. More work is necessary be-
fore elicited templates can be automati-
cally plugged into the system.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999984446808511">
A common approach for natural language gener-
ation in task-oriented spoken dialogue systems is
template-based generation: a set of templates is
manually constructed by system developers, and
instantiated with slot values at runtime. When
the set of templates is limited, frequent interac-
tions with the system can quickly become repet-
itive, and the naturalness of the interaction is lost.
In this work, we propose and investigate a
methodology for developing a corpus of natural
language generation templates for a spoken dia-
logue system via crowdsourcing. We use an ex-
isting dialogue system that generates utterances
from templates, and explore how well a crowd
can generate reliable paraphrases given snippets
from the system’s original dialogues. By utiliz-
ing dialogue data collected from interactions with
an existing system, we can begin to learn differ-
ent ways to converse while controlling the crowd
to stay within the scope of the original system.
The proposed approach aims to leverage the sys-
tem’s existing capabilities together with the power
of the crowd to expand the system’s natural lan-
guage repertoire and create richer interactions.
Our methodology begins with an existing cor-
pus of dialogues, extracted from a spoken dia-
logue system that gives directions in a building.
Further details on this system are given in §4.1.
The extracted dialogue corpus contains phrases
the system has generated, and crowd-workers con-
struct alternates for these phrases, which can be
plugged back into the system as crowd templates.
We investigate via crowdsourcing the effect of the
amount of surrounding context provided to work-
ers on the perceived meaning, naturalness, and di-
versity of the alternates they produce, and study
the acceptability of these alternates from a sys-
tem developer viewpoint. Our results indicate that
the crowd provides reasonable and diverse tem-
plates with this methodology. The developer eval-
uation suggests that additional work is necessary
before we can automatically plug crowdsourced
templates directly into the system.
We begin by discussing related work in §2. In
§3, we detail the proposed methodology. In §4, we
describe the experimental setup and results. Di-
rections for future work are discussed in §5.

Online crowdsourcing has gained popularity in
recent years because it provides easy and cheap
programmatic access to human intelligence. Re-
searchers have proposed using crowdsourcing
for a diverse set of natural language process-
ing tasks, including paired data collection for
training machine translation systems (Zaidan and
Callison-Burch, 2011), evaluation of NLP systems
(Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010) and speech
transcriptions (Parent and Eskenazi, 2010). A
popular task targeting language diversity is para-
phrase generation, which aims at collecting di-
verse phrases while preserving the original mean-

been studied for the purposes of plagiarism detec-
tion (Burrows and Stein, 2013), machine transla-
tion (Buzek et al., 2010), and expanding language
models used in mobile applications (Han and Ju,
2013). Automated and crowd-based methods have
been proposed for evaluating paraphrases gener-
ated by the crowd (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010;
Tschirsich and Hintz, 2013). Researchers have
proposed workflows to increase the diversity of
language collected with crowd-based paraphrase
generation (Negri et al., 2012) and for reducing
the language bias in generation by initiating gen-
eration with visual input (Chen and Dolan, 2011).
While paraphrase generation typically aims to pre-
serve the meaning of a phrase without considering
its use beyond the sentence level, we focus on col-
lecting diverse language to be used directly in a
dialogue system in a way that agrees with the full
dialogue context.
Manually authoring dialogue systems has been
identified as a challenging and time-consuming
task (Ward and Pellom, 1999), motivating re-
searchers to explore opportunities to use the crowd
to improve and evaluate dialogue systems. Wang
et al. (2012) proposed methods to acquire corpora
for NLP systems using semantic forms as seeds,
and for analyzing the quality of the collected cor-
pora. Liu et al. (2010) used crowdsourcing for
free-form language generation and for semantic
labeling, with the goal of generating language cor-
pora for new domains. Crowd-workers contribute
to dialogue generation in real-time in the Chorus
system by providing input about what the system
should say next (Lasecki et al., 2013). Crowd-
sourcing has also been used with some success for
dialogue system evaluation (Jur˘ci˘cek et al., 2011).
Previous work on increasing language diversity
in dialogue systems with crowdsourcing has fo-
cused on learning about diversity in user input
to improve components such as speech recogni-
tion and language understanding (e.g., Wang et al.
(2012)). Instead, our work focuses on adding di-
versity to system outputs. Mairesse et al. (2010)
followed a similar approach to the work reported
here, using crowdsourcing to collect paraphrases
for a dialogue system in the restaurant domain.
However, the focus of the Mairesse et al. work was
on training an NLG module using this data. Our
work focuses on crowdsourcing techniques to ex-
tract relevant paraphrases, examining the effect of
context on their suitability and generalizability.

3 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988447368421">
Our methodology for developing natural language
generation templates is illustrated by the pipeline
in Figure 1. This pipeline is designed for di-
alogue systems that use a template-based natu-
ral language generation component. It assumes
that the given system has an initial set of lan-
guage generation templates that have been man-
ually authored, and expands from there. The ini-
tial system is used to collect a corpus of dialogues,
which we will refer to as the dialogue seed cor-
pus, through interactions with users. Based on the
dialogue seed corpus, we automatically construct
a set of generation HITs, web-based crowdsourc-
ing tasks that are used to elicit paraphrases from
crowd-workers for instantiated system templates.
A generation HIT displays one of the system turns
extracted from a system dialogue, with a phrase
highlighted, and different amounts of surround-
ing context in different conditions. The worker is
asked to replace the phrase with another one that
keeps the same meaning and the coherence of the
interaction. If slots are marked in the original, they
must be preserved by the worker, which allows us
to easily convert the elicited paraphrases to crowd
templates. Once a corpus of crowd templates are
collected in this fashion, a system developer may
filter and decide which to add as viable alternatives
to the system’s existing list of language generation
templates (top path in the pipeline from Figure 1).
We also construct a set of evaluation HITs and
post them to the crowd to assess the suitability and
relative naturalness of the crowd templates (bot-
tom path in the pipeline from Figure 1.) We study
how the scores obtained in this crowd-evaluation
may be used to help filter the set of new templates
that are presented as candidates to the system de-
veloper. In the following subsections, we describe
each of the pipeline components in detail.

We assume as a starting point an existing dialogue
system that uses a template-based language gener-
ation component. The system uses a set of tem-
plates T, which are instantiated with slots filled to
generate system phrases. A system turn may con-
tain one or more such phrases connected together.
For instance, in the dialogue fragments shown in
Figure 2, the template “Sorry, that was [Place]
you wanted, right?” generates at runtime “Sorry,

right?”. Statistics on the dialogue seed corpus
used in this study are provided in §4.2.
The proposed methodology does not require
transcriptions of user utterances in the dialogue
seed corpus; instead, it utilizes the recognition re-
sults for each user turn. The primary reason be-
hind this choice is that a dialogue that contains
recognized user turns may be more coherent than
one that contains transcripts and can be generated
automatically, as the dialogue manager generates
system responses based on the recognition results.
However, turn-overtaking issues and recognition
problems sometimes resulted in incoherent dia-
logue interactions. Improving speech recognition
remains an area for future work.

3.2 Generation HITs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999578">
We use the dialogue seed corpus to produce gener-
ation HITs to elicit paraphrases for system phrases
from crowd-workers. In the simplest form, a gen-
eration HIT might present a single system phrase
to the worker. We hypothesize that the surround-
ing context may be an important factor in facili-
tating the construction of appropriate paraphrases,
affecting their diversity, naturalness, generaliz-
ability, etc.; we therefore investigate the effect of
presenting varying amounts of dialogue context to
the worker.
Specifically, given a system phrase correspond-
ing to a template t instantiated in a dialogue, we
investigate six different dialogue context condi-
tions. A phrase in a condition presented to a
crowd-worker will be referred to as a seed, p. Ex-
amples of seeds in each condition are illustrated in
Figure 2. In the first condition, denoted Phrase,
a seed is presented to the worker in isolation. In
the second condition, denoted S, the entire sys-
tem turn containing p is presented to the worker,
with p highlighted. In the next 4 conditions, de-
noted suS, suSu, susuS, susuSu, seeds are pre-
sented in increasingly larger contexts including
one or two previous system and user turns (de-
noted with lowercase ‘s’ and ‘u’ in the encoding

above), followed by the system turn S that con-
tains the highlighted seed p, followed in two con-
ditions (susuSu and suSu) by another user turn.
Not all context conditions are applicable for each
instantiated template, e.g., conditions that require
previous context, such as suS, cannot be con-
structed for phrases appearing in the first system
turn. We follow a between-subjects design, such

that each worker works on only a single condition.
Each generation HIT elicits a paraphrase for a
seed. The HIT additionally contains instructions
and examples of what workers are expected to do
and not to do.1 We instruct workers to read the
dialogue presented and rephrase the highlighted
phrase (seed) so as to preserve the meaning and
the cohesion of the interaction. To identify slots
accurately in the crowd-generated paraphrases, we
mark slot values in the given seed with bold italics
and instruct workers to keep this portion exactly
the same in their paraphrases (see Figure 2). These
paraphrases are then turned into crowd templates
following 3 basic steps: (1) Spelling error cor-
rection; (2) Normalization;2 and (3) Replacing
filled slots in the worker’s paraphrase with the slot
name. We ask workers to provide paraphrases (in
English) that differ from the original phrase more
substantially than by punctuation changes, and im-
plement controls to ensure that workers enter slot
values.
In completing the generation tasks, the crowd
produces a corpus of paraphrases, one paraphrase
for each seed. For example, “I apologize, are you
looking for Ernestine Patrick’s office?”, is a para-
phrase for the highlighted seed shown in Figure 2.
As we have asked the workers not to alter slot val-
ues, crowd templates can easily be recovered, e.g.,
“I apologize, are you looking for [Place]?”

3.3 Evaluation HITs

<bodyText confidence="0.999945277777778">
A good crowd template must minimally satisfy
two criteria: (1) It should maintain the meaning
of the original template; and (2) It should sound
natural in any dialogue context where the original
template was used by the dialogue manager, i.e., it
should generalize well, beyond the specifics of the
dialogue from which it was elicited.
To assess crowd template quality, we construct
evaluation HITs for each crowd template. Instan-
tiated versions of the original template and the
crowd template are displayed as options A and
B (with randomized assignment) and highlighted
as part of the entire dialogue in which the origi-
nal template was used (see Figure 3). In this in-
context (IC) evaluation HIT, the worker is asked
whether the instantiated crowd template has the
same meaning as the original, and which is more
natural. In addition, because the original dialogues

were sometimes incoherent (see §3.1), we also
asked the evaluation workers to judge whether the
given phrases made sense in the given context.
Finally, in order to assess how well the crowd
template generalizes across different dialogues,
we use a second, out-of-context (OOC) eval-
uation HIT. For each crowd template, we ran-
domly selected a new dialogue where the tem-
plate t appeared. The out-of-context evaluation
HIT presents the instantiated original template and
crowd template in this new dialogue. The crowd-
workers thus assess the crowd template in a dia-
logue context different from the one in which it
was collected. We describe the evaluation HITs in
further detail in §4.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999045">
While a crowd-based evaluation can provide in-
sights into the quality of the crowd templates, ul-
timately, whether or not a template is appropriate
for use in the dialogue system depends on many
other factors (e.g., register, style, expectations,
system goals, etc.). The last step in the proposed
methodology is therefore a manual inspection of
the crowd templates by a system developer, who
assesses which are acceptable for use in the sys-
tem without changes.

We now describe our experiments and results. We
aim to discover whether there is an effect of the
amount of surrounding context on perceived crowd
template naturalness. We additionally explore
whether the crowd template retains the meaning
of the original template, whether they both make
sense in the given context, and the diversity of
the templates that the crowd produced for each
template type. We report results when the tem-
plates are instantiated in-context, in the original
dialogue; and out-of-context, in a new dialogue.
We first describe the experimental test-bed and the
corpora used and collected below.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997032485714286">
The test-bed for our experiments is Directions
Robot, a situated dialogue system that provides
directions to peoples’ offices, conference rooms,
and other locations in our building (Bohus et al.,
2014). The system couples a Nao humanoid
robot with a software infrastructure for multi-
modal, physically situated dialogue (Bohus and
Horvitz, 2009) and has been deployed for several
months in an open space, in front of the elevator
bank on the 3rd floor of our building (see Figure
4). While some of the interactions are need-based,
e.g., visitors coming to the building for meetings,
many are also driven by curiosity about the robot.
The Directions Robot utilizes rule-based natu-
ral language generation, with one component for
giving directions based on computed paths, and
another component with 38 templates for the rest
of the dialogue. Our experimentation focuses on
these 38 templates. As the example shown in Fig-
ure 2 illustrates, slots are dynamically filled in at
run-time, based on the dialogue history.
We conducted our experiments on a general-

sal Human Relevance System (UHRS).3 The mar-
ketplace connects human intelligence tasks with a
large population of workers across the globe. It
provides controls for selecting the country of res-
idence and native languages for workers, and for
limiting the maximum number of tasks that can be
done by a single worker.

Dialogue seed corpus We used 167 dialogues
collected with the robot over a period of one week
(5 business days) as the dialogue seed corpus. The
number of turns in these dialogues (including sys-
tem and user) ranges from 1 to 41, with a mean of
10 turns. 30 of the 38 templates (79%) appeared
in this corpus.
Generation HITs We used the dialogue seed
corpus to construct generation HITs, as described
in §3.2. In a pilot study, we found that for every
10 instances of a template submitted to the crowd,
we received approximately 6 unique paraphrases
in return, with slightly different ratios for each of
the six conditions. We used the ratios observed for
each condition in the pilot study to down-sample
the number of instances we created for each tem-
plate seen more than 10 times in the corpus. The
total number of generation HITs resulting for each
condition is shown in Table 1.

generation are shown in Table 1. Each worker
could complete at most 1/6 of the total HITs for
that condition. We paid 3 cents for each genera-

workers. From this set, we removed corrupt re-
sponses, and all paraphrases for a generation HIT
where at least one of the 3 workers did not cor-
rectly write the slot values. This yielded a total of
9123 paraphrases, with 5408 unique paraphrases.

4.3 Crowd-based Evaluation

<bodyText confidence="0.999977823529412">
Evaluation HITs To keep the crowd evaluation
tractable, we randomly sampled 25% of the para-
phrases generated for all conditions to produce
evaluation HITs. We excluded paraphrases from
seeds that did not receive paraphrases from all 3
workers or were missing required slots. As dis-
cussed in §3, paraphrases were converted to crowd
templates, and each crowd template was instanti-
ated in the original dialogue, in-context (IC) and
in a randomly selected out-of-context (OOC) dia-
logue. The OOC templates were instantiated with
slots relevant to the chosen dialogue. This process
yielded 2281 paraphrases, placed into each of the
two contexts.
Crowd evaluation process As discussed in
§3.3, instantiated templates (crowd and original)
were displayed as options A and B, with random-
ized assignment (see Figure 3). Workers were
asked to judge whether the original and the crowd
template had the same meaning, and whether they
made sense in the dialogue context. Workers then
rated which was more natural on a 5-point ordi-
nal scale ranging from -2 to 2, where a -2 rating
marked that the original was much more natural
than the crowd template. Statistics on the judg-
ments collected in the evaluation HITs are shown
in Table 1. Workers were paid 7 cents for each
HIT. Each worker could complete at most 5% of
all HITs, and each HIT was completed by 5 unique
workers.
Outlier elimination One challenge with crowd-
sourced evaluations is noise introduced by spam-
mers. While questions with known answers may
be used to detect spammers in objective tasks, the
subjective nature of our evaluation tasks makes
this difficult: a worker who does not agree with the
majority may simply have different opinions about
the paraphrase meaning or naturalness. Instead of
spam detection, we therefore seek to identify and
eliminate outliers; in addition, as previously dis-
cussed, each HIT was performed by 5 workers, in
an effort to increase robustness.
We focused attention on workers who per-
formed at least 20 HITs (151 of 230 workers, cov-
ering 98% of the total number of HITs). Since
we randomized the A/B assignment of instantiated
original templates and crowd templates, we expect
to see a symmetric distribution over the relative
naturalness scores of all judgments produced by a
worker. To identify workers violating this expec-
tation, we computed a score that reflected the sym-
metry of the histogram of the naturalness votes for
each worker. We considered as outliers 6 work-
ers that were more than z=1.96 standard deviations
away from the mean on this metric (corresponding
to a 95% confidence interval). Secondly, we com-
puted a score that reflected the percentage of tasks
where a worker was in a minority, i.e., had the
single opposing vote to the other workers on the
same meaning question. We eliminated 4 work-
ers, who fell in the top 97.5 percentile of this dis-
tribution. We corroborated these analyses with a
visual inspection of scatterplots showing these two
metrics against the number of tasks performed by
each judge.4 As one worker failed on both criteria,
overall, 9 workers (covering 9% of all judgements)
were considered outliers and their responses were
excluded.

Meaning and Sense Across conditions, we find
that most crowd templates are evaluated as hav-
ing the same meaning as the original and mak-
ing sense by the majority of workers. Evaluation
percentages are shown in Table 2, and are around
90% across the board. This suggests that in most
cases, the generation task yields crowd templates
that meet the goal of preserving the meaning of the
original template.
Naturalness To evaluate whether the amount of
surrounding context has an effect on the perceived
naturalness of a paraphrase relative to the original
phrase, we use a Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test on the
mean scores for each of the paraphrases, setting
our significance level to .05. A Kruskal-Wallis
test is a non-parametric test useful for significance
testing when the independent variable is categor-
ical and the data is not assumed to be normally
distributed. We find that there is an effect of con-
dition on the relative naturalness score (KW chi-
squared = 15.9156, df = 5, p = 0.007) when crowd

The susuS condition yields the most diverse templates using crowd-based metrics; removing templates
seen once in the evaluation corpus, this condition has the highest acceptance in the developer evaluation.
templates are evaluated in-context, but not out-of-
context (KW chi-squared = 9.4102, df = 5, p-value
= 0.09378). Average relative naturalness scores in
each condition are shown in Table 2.
Diversity We also assess the diversity of the
templates elicited from the crowd, based on the
evaluation set. Specifically, we calculate a diver-
sity score (D-score) for each template type t. We
calculate this score as the number of unique crowd
template types for t voted to make sense and have
the same meaning as the original by the majority,
divided by the total number of seeds for t with
evaluated crowd templates. More formally, let P
be the original template instantiations that have
evaluated crowd templates, M the set of unique
crowd template types voted as having the same
meaning as the original template by the majority
of workers, and S the set of unique crowd tem-
plate types voted as making sense in the dialogue
by the majority of workers. Then:

The average diversity scores across all tem-
plates for each condition are shown in Table 2.
We find the templates that yield the most di-
verse crowd templates include WL Retry “Where
are you trying to get to in this building?” and
OK Help, “Okay, I think I can help you with
that”, which have a diversity rating of 1.0 in sev-
eral conditions: for each template instance we in-
stantiate (i.e., each generation HIT), we get a new,
unique crowd template back. Example crowd tem-
plates for the OK Help category include “I be-
lieve I can help you find that” and “I can help
you ok”. The templates with the least diversity are
those for Hi, which has a D-score around 0.2 in
the S and Phrase conditions.

4.5 Developer Acceptability Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99992775">
For the set of crowd templates used in the crowd-
based evaluation process, one of the system de-
velopers5 provided binary judgments on whether
each template could be added (without making any
changes) to the system or not. The developer had
access to the original template, extensive knowl-
edge about the system and domain, and the way in
which each of these templates are used.
Results indicate that the developer retained 487
of the 1493 unique crowd templates that were used
in crowd-evaluation (33%). A breakdown of this
acceptance rate by condition is shown in Table 2.
When we eliminate templates seen only once in
the evaluation corpus, acceptability increases, at
the expense of recall. We additionally calculate
a diversity score from those templates accepted
by the developer, which is simply the number of
crowd template types accepted by the developer,
divided by the total number of seeds used to elicit
the crowd templates in the developer’s evaluation,
for each template type t.
The developer evaluation revealed a wide range
of reasons for excluding crowd templates. Some
of the most common were lack of grammatical-
ity, length (some paraphrases were too long/short),
stylistic mismatch with the system, and incorrect
punctuation. Other reasons included register is-
sues, e.g., too casual/presumptive/impolite, issues
of specificity, e.g., template was too general, and
issues of incompatibility with the dialogue state
and turn construction process. Overall, the de-
veloper interview highlighted very specific system

4.6 Crowd-based Evaluation and Developer
Acceptability
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984451612903">
We now turn to an investigation of whether statis-
tics from the crowd-based generation and evalu-
ation processes can be used to automatically fil-
ter crowd templates. Specifically, we look at two
heuristics, with results plotted in Figure 5. These
heuristics are applied across the evaluation cor-
pus, collating data from all conditions. The first
heuristic, Heur1, uses a simple threshold on the
number of times a crowd template occurred in the
evaluation corpus.6 We hypothesize that more fre-
quent paraphrases are more likely to be acceptable
to the developer, and in fact, as we increase the
frequency threshold, precision increases and recall
decreases.
The second heuristic, Heur2, combines the
threshold on counts with additional scores col-
lected in the out-of-context crowd-evaluation: It
only considers templates with an aggregated judg-
ment on the same meaning question greater than
50% (i.e., the majority of the crowd thought the
paraphrase had the same meaning as the origi-
nal), and with an aggregated relative naturalness
score above the overall mean. As Figure 5 illus-
trates, different tradeoffs between precision and
recall can be achieved via these heuristics, and by
varying the count threshold.
These results indicate that developer filtering re-
mains a necessary step for adding new dialogue
system templates, as the filtering process cannot
yet be replaced by the crowd-evaluation. This is
not surprising since the evaluation HITs did not

express all the different factors that we found the
developer took into account when selecting tem-
plates, such as style decisions and how phrases are
combined in the system to form a dialogue. Future
work may consider expanding evaluation HITs to
reflect some of these aspects. By using signals ac-
quired through crowd generation and evaluation,
we should be able to reduce the load for the de-
veloper by presenting a smaller and more precise
candidate list at the expense of reductions in recall.

5 Discussion

<bodyText confidence="0.999989121212121">
We proposed and investigated a methodology for
developing a corpus of natural language genera-
tion templates for a spoken dialogue system via
crowdsourcing. We investigated the effect of the
context we provided to the workers on the per-
ceived meaning, naturalness, and diversity of the
alternates obtained, and evaluated the acceptabil-
ity of these alternates from a system developer
viewpoint.
Our results show that the crowd is able to pro-
vide suitable and diverse paraphrases within this
methodology, which can then be converted into
crowd templates. However, more work is nec-
essary before elicited crowd templates can be
plugged directly into a system.
In future work, we hope to continue this pro-
cess and investigate using features from the crowd
and judgments from system developers in a ma-
chine learning paradigm to automatically identify
crowd templates that can be directly added to the
dialogue system. We would also like to extend be-
yond paraphrasing single templates to entire sys-
tem turns. With appropriate controls and feature
weighting, we may be able to further expand dia-
logue capabilities using the combined knowledge
of the crowd. We expect that by eliciting lan-
guage templates from multiple people, as opposed
to a few developers, the approach may help con-
verge towards a more natural distribution of al-
ternative phrasings in a dialogue. Finally, future
work should also investigate the end-to-end effects
of introducing crowd elicited templates on the in-
teractions with the user.

<abstract confidence="0.998682882352941">We explore the use of crowdsourcing to generate natural language in spoken dialogue systems. We introduce a methodology to elicit novel templates from the crowd based on a dialogue seed corpus, and investigate the effect that the amount of surrounding dialogue context has on the generation task. Evaluation is performed both with a crowd and with a system developer to assess the naturalness and suitability of the elicited phrases. Results indicate that the crowd is able to provide reasonable and diverse templates within this methodology. More work is necessary before elicited templates can be automatically plugged into the system.</abstract>

Wang et al. (2012) proposed methods to acquire corpora for NLP systems using semantic forms as seeds, and for analyzing the quality of the collected corpora. Liu et al. (2010) used crowdsourcing for free-form language generation and for semantic labeling, with the goal of generating language corpora for new domains. Crowd-workers contribute to dialogue generation in real-time in the Chorus system by providing input about what the system should say next (Lasecki et al., 2013). Crowdsourcing has also been used with some success for dialogue system evaluation (Jur˘ci˘cek et al., 2011). Previous work on increasing language diversity in dialogue systems with crowdsourcing has focused on learning about diversity in user input to improve components such as speech recognition and language understanding (e.g., Wang et al. (2012)). Instead, our work focuses on adding diversity to system outputs. Mairesse et al. (2010) followed a similar approach to the work reported here, using crowdsourcing to collect paraphrases for a dialogue system in the restaurant domain. However, th</context>

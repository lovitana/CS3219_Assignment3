There are more than 60 wordnets world-
wide; the Romanian wordnet is among
those that are maintained and further de-
veloped. Begun within the BalkaNet pro-
ject and further enriched in various (ap-
plication oriented) projects, it was used in
word sense disambiguation, machine
translation and question answering with
promising results. We present here the
latest qualitative and quantitative im-
provements of our lexical resource, spe-
cial attention being paid to derivational
relations, the latest statistics, as well as
the development of an Application Pro-
gramming Interface, meant to facilitate
work with the wordnet, both for its fur-
ther development purposes and for its use
in applications. In the context of creating
a common European research infrastruc-
ture network, our wordnet is licensed
through META-SHARE, being freely
available for scientific purposes.

The development of the Romanian wordnet
(RoWN henceforth) started within BalkaNet pro-

RESDEC4, ACCURAT5, METANET4U6 , the
Romanian Academy research plan.
Within BalkaNet a core of 18000 synsets was
created. They were aligned to the Princeton
WordNet (PWN) versions available throughout
time, respectively version 2.0 at the end of the
project. Among those synsets there were more
than 400 that lexicalize concepts specific to the
Balkan area. These were implemented in all six
languages of the project (Bulgarian, Czech,
Greek, Romanian, Serbian, Turkish) and were
linked to hypernym synsets, already existing in
PWN, so they were not left dangling in the net-
work.
RoWN contains words belonging both to the
general vocabulary and to various domains of
activity. Throughout time, we aimed at a com-
plete coverage of the basic common sets from
EuroWordNet 7 , of the 1984 corpus 8 , of the
newspaper articles corpus NAACL20039, of the
Acquis Communautaire corpus and the Eurovoc
thesaurus10, of VerbNet 3.111, and as much as
possible from the ROWikipedia lexical stock.
Two basic development principles have al-
ways been followed: the Hierarchy Preservation

Principle (HPP) (according to which the hierar-
chical structure of the concepts in a wordnet is
the same irrespective of the natural language for
which the wordnet is developed) and the Con-
ceptual Density Principle (which ensures that
once a concept is selected to be implemented, all
its ancestors up to the unique beginners are also
selected, thus preventing the existence of dan-
gling nodes) (Tufiş et al., 2004). The former
principle was the assumption behind our devel-
opment methodology, namely the expand meth-
od. The latter ensured the lack of dangling nodes
in the nouns and verbs hierarchies. As a conse-
quence of the way we chose to create our lan-
guage resource, the lexical density has never
been our preoccupation, thus there are many
words that do not occur in as many synsets as
how many meanings they have. Nevertheless, we
do not exclude such an objective from our further
developments.
At present, RoWN is aligned to PWN version
3.0. Details about the way we performed the
alignment from PWN 2.0 to PWN 3.0 and about
the way we solved the encountered problems (the
n:1 or 1:n matches between synsets in the two
versions) are presented in Tufiş et al. (2013).
RoWN is licensed through META-SHARE12
(). It is free for academic research, but restricted
for commercial use.
In this paper we present the latest qualitative
and quantitative improvements of our lexical re-
source, the latest statistics (Section 3), special
attention being paid to derivational relations
(Section 4), as well as the development of an
Application Programming Interface, meant to
facilitate work with the wordnet, both for its fur-
ther development purposes and for its use in ap-
plications (Section 5). Our intentions for further
development are included in the Conclusions
section. Before proceeding, we enumerate the
applications in which our team used RoWN and
which, throughout time, influenced our decisions
about the concepts to be further implemented in
the network.

Ion and Tufiş (2009) and Ion and Ştefănescu

(WSD) methods that make use of wordnets: the
former is set in a multilingual environment and
the WSD is done with the help of aligned word-

nets. The latter is set in a monolingual environ-
ment and the WSD is done with the help of the
lexical chains established between the co-
occurring words in the text, chains whose length
is calculated in the wordnet. The assumption is
that the shorter the lexical chain, the more simi-
lar the words. The length of the lexical chain de-
pends on the number of relations marked in the
network. The results in the multilingual envi-
ronment are reported as better than those in the
monolingual one.
For a Question Answering (QA) system,
RoWN was used for expanding the query intro-
duced by the user (Ion et al., 2008) with words
semantically related (i.e., synonyms, hypo- and
hyperonyms) to the ones it contained. Moreover,
RoWN was also used in the last phase, that of
ranking the found results by calculating the se-
mantic distance, again as a lexical chain, be-
tween the words introduced by the user and those
occurring in the text. It was noticed that the rela-
tions with the greatest contribution at calculating
the score are hyponymy and derivational rela-
tions.
Aligned wordnets are valuable sources of
cross-language equivalents, especially multi-
word terms, in machine translation.

3 Latest Quantitative Developments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99949519047619">
Lately our efforts of implementing new synsets
aimed at a complete coverage of VerbNet 3.1,
with the prospect of creating a syntactic parser
for Romanian.
The up-to-date statistics about RoWN are pre-
sented in Table 1 and 2 below. In the former,
PoS stands for part of speech, S for synset, L for
literal, UL for unique literals and NL for nonlex-
icalized synsets. Obeying the HPP stated above
implies the transfer of the hierarchies from PWN
into RoWN. The lack of perfect equivalences
among languages is widely known; nevertheless,
we chose to disregard it. Moreover, there are lex-
ical gaps in all languages. We call them nonlexi-
calized concepts and represent them as empty
synsets. For example, for the PWN verbal synset
{zip_up:1} (gloss: close with a zipper) there is
no literal in the corresponding Romanian synset.
However, such synsets do not lack relations: the
corresponding ones from PWN are transferred
into RoWN.

It is worth noticing that antonymy, which is a
lexical relation in PWN, is represented as a se-
mantic one in RoWN. The conceptual opposition
between the synsets is more useful in various
applications than the mere antonymy between
two literals.
With the exception of attribute relation, all the
others enumerated in Table 2 link synsets with
literals of the same part of speech. A path be-
tween two words of a different part of speech,
about which any speaker would say they are re-
lated, although not impossible to find, would be
too long, thus providing wrong information
about the similarity between those words.

Using RoWN in applications, as presented
above, showed unnatural lexical chains, such as
one of the possible chains between inventator

<bodyText confidence="0.999876222222222">
The strangeness of this example results from the
intricate path from inventator to inventa, un-
common for whatever speaker of Romanian: in-
ventator – James Watt – inginer &amp;quot;engineer&amp;quot; –
inginer software &amp;quot;software engineer&amp;quot; – pro-
grama &amp;quot;to program&amp;quot; – crea mental &amp;quot;to create by
mental act&amp;quot; – inventa.
Faced with a number of such cases, we decid-
ed to implement derivational relations into our
wordnet.
This type of relations exists in other wordnets
as well: the Turkish WordNet (Bilgin et al.,
2004), PWN (Fellbaum et al., 2007), the Czech
WordNet (Pala and Hlaváčková, 2007), the
Polish WordNet (Piasecki et al., 2012), the Esto-
nian one (Kahusk, et al., 2010). Given the lan-
guage-specific character of such relations, each
team undertook their own strategy for finding the
relations in their wordnet. However, there are
teams that transferred the derivational relations
in PWN and then validated them: this is the case
for the Bulgarian WordNet (Koeva, 2008), the
Serbian (Koeva et al., 2008) and the Finnish one
(Lindén and Niemi, 2013).
Whereas most of the undertakings above
aimed at expanding the network with new
synsets derivationally linked with the literals al-
ready in the wordnet, we were interested in add-
ing such relations between literals that are in the
synsets. No extension was intended, at least for
the moment.
We discuss below some theoretical aspects of
derivational relations and the significance of
their representation in a wordnet and then present
the methodology we adopted for identifying and
annotating them in RoWN.

4.1 Pre-requisites
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999966625">
Derivation is one means of creating new words
in a language from existing morphemes, i.e. the
smallest units of a language that have their own
meaning. It ensures both formal and semantic
relatedness between the root and the derived
word: the formal relatedness is ensured by the
fact that the root and the derived word contain
(almost) the same string of letters that represent
the root, while the semantic relatedness is en-
sured by the compositionality of meaning of the
derived word: its meaning is a sum of the mean-
ing of the root and the meaning of the affix(es).
Thus, the Romanian words alerga &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; and
alergdtor &amp;quot;runner&amp;quot; are derivationally related: the
latter is obtained from the former by adding the
suffix -dtor (after removing -a, the infinitive suf-
fix) and it means &amp;quot;the one who runs&amp;quot;. However,
derivational relations cannot be established for
all meanings of these words: when considered
with their proper meaning, they are related, but
when alerga is considered with its figurative
meaning &amp;quot;to try hard to get something&amp;quot;, it does
not establish a derivational relation with
alergdtor, as it has not developed any related
figurative meaning.
In the derivation process only one affix of a
type is added. So, a prefix and a suffix can be
added to a root in the same derivation step, but
never two suffixes or/and two prefixes. If a word
contains more than two affixes of the same type,
then they were attached in different steps in the
derivation.

4.2 Identifying derivational relations be-
tween literals in RoWN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998483777777778">
Having available a list of (492) Romanian affixes
and the list of (31872) simple literals in RoWN,
we searched for pairs of literals (literal1 and lit-
eral2) such that literal1 +/- affix(es) = literal2. The
&amp;quot;+&amp;quot; version covers progressive derivation, while
the &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; version covers backformation. We al-
lowed for at most 2 affixes, but of different
types, as discussed above. The results are pre-
sented in Table 3:

</tableCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9866646">
The percents are reasonable: it is a well-
known fact that prefixation is weakly productive
in Romanian, unlike suffixation.
We subjected the found pairs to an automatic
and then a manual validation. For the former, we
enriched the list of affixes with information
about the part of speech of the words to which
they can attach and of the words they help create.
The list is available at www.racai.ro/~vergi un-
der Research. For example, the suffix -a can be
attached to nouns or to adjectives to create verbs:
-a n&gt;v a&gt;v
Examples include: buton (&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;) + -a &gt; buto-
na (&amp;quot;to channel-surf&amp;quot;), scurt (&amp;quot;short&amp;quot;) + -a &gt;
scurta (&amp;quot;to shorten&amp;quot;).
Afterwards we proceeded to a manual valida-
tion of the whole number of pairs. The results are
presented in Table 4: for each type of derivation
(DT) (prefixation P or suffixation S), from the
found pairs (column 2) we present the number of
those passing the automatic validation (AV) in
column 3 and then of those that passed the man-
ual validation (MV) in column 4; the last column

<bodyText confidence="0.980585155555556">
Having already established that derivational rela-
tions need to be marked at the word sense level,
not for all senses of the words in a pair, the next
necessary step is to calculate the Cartesian prod-
uct of the sets of synsets in which the members
of the validated pairs occur. Thus, for the 10442
pairs of literals resulted after manual validation,
we calculated the Cartesian product for each pair,
obtaining a total of 101729 pairs of synsets. They
display formal relatedness and, in order to mark
a derivational relation for them, it is also neces-
sary to subject them to a semantic evaluation. A
linguist goes through them and whenever seman-
tic similarity is noticed, the pair is labeled with
one of the 57 semantic labels we established: 16
for prefixed words (together, subsumption, oppo-
sition, mero, eliminate, iterative, through, repeat,
imply, similitude, instead, aug, before, anti, out,
back) and 41 for suffixed ones (subsumption,
member_holo, member_mero, substance_holo,
substance_mero, ingredient_holo, holonym, part,
agent, result, location, of_origin, job, state, peri-
od, undergoer, instrument, sound, cause, contain-
er, vehicle, body_part, material, destination, gen-
der, wife, dim, aug, object_made_by, subject_to,
by_means_of, clothes, event, abstract, colour,
tax, make_become, make_acquire, manner, si-
militude, related).
The most frequently attached semantic labels
are: for prefixed words: opposition (neesenţial
&amp;quot;unessential&amp;quot; – essential &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot;) (792), sub-
sumption (subclasă &amp;quot;subclass&amp;quot; – clasă &amp;quot;class&amp;quot;)
(363), repeat (reaprinde &amp;quot;reignite&amp;quot; – aprinde
&amp;quot;ignite&amp;quot;) (305); for suffixed words: related
(călduros &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot; – căldură &amp;quot;warmth&amp;quot;) (1294),
event (împărtăşanie &amp;quot;communion&amp;quot; – împărtăşi

ulate&amp;quot;) (394). At the end of the article, in the An-

<bodyText confidence="0.996449636363636">
We have built an Application Programming In-
terface (API) for RoWN, called RoWordNetLib,
meant as a tool to aid quick implementations of
RoWN into both research-oriented and industry
applications. When designing it, we envisaged a
tool that should be easy to use, easy to extend
and that would offer a sufficiently large array of
functionalities. The chosen programming lan-
guage is Java.
The main functionalities that RoWordNetLib
provides are:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99932275">
• Input/Output for working with XML-
based RoWN files;
• Methods for working with the semantic
network itself (RoWordNet objects con-
taining RoWN);
• Set operations for working with multiple
RoWordNet objects (reunion, intersection,
complement, difference, merge, etc.);
• Basic Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
algorithms;
• Similarity Metrics (both distance-based
and semantic).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99984241509434">
The API’s uses can be classified as (1) internal –
it helps to facilitate the continuous work of en-
riching RoWN and (2) external – to quicken the
development of Romanian-enabled smart appli-
cations. By providing set operations like differ-
ence, intersection or reunion on RoWordNet ob-
jects, more people can work in parallel on
RoWN and then easily join their versions into a
single wordnet, thus easing its development. Ex-
ternally, wordnets are successfully used to per-
form word sense disambiguation, information
retrieval, information extraction, machine trans-
lation, automatic text classification and summa-
rization.
RoWordNetLib is structured into several
packages, each with its assigned functionality.
The main packages are: &apos;data&apos;, &apos;io&apos;, &apos;op&apos; and &apos;wsd&apos;.
The &apos;data&apos; package contains the data structures
RoWordNetLib uses internally. Its structure is
simple, following the way the data is naturally
structured in a wordnet: a RoWordNet object
contains an array of Synset objects which are
indexed by the synset ID for retrieval speed.
Each Synset object contains a number of primi-
tive types as well as an array of Literal objects
and an array of Relation objects. A Literal object
contains a word and an associated sense. A Rela-
tion object contains a relation (string) that points
to a target synset (defined as an ID), as well as
optionally having a source and target literal for
cases where the relation is not between synsets
but between two synsets’ particular literals.
The &apos;io&apos; package provides input and output
functions. The most important I/O function is
reading and writing RoWordNet objects in their
native XML format.
The &apos;op&apos; package provides different operation-
al tools: (1) set operation methods for joining,
intersecting, complementing, etc., multiple
RoWordNet objects; (2) through the BFWalk
class, the ability to perform a breadth-first walk
through the RoWN semantic network; (3) a
number of distance-based and semantic similari-
ty measures (Resnik, 1995) for measuring the
closeness of concepts (lexicalized by literals in
synsets).
The &apos;wsd&apos; package implements two Word
Sense Disambiguation algorithms: Lesk (1986)
and an adapted version of Lesk. They are used to
obtain information content values for synsets in
RoWN given an arbitrary Romanian text as the
input corpus, which is further used to enable the
semantic similarity measures.

the other interests of the group. For instance, the
last set of implemented synsets was made up of
verbs exclusively, given our present interest to
cover VerbNet 3.1, with the prospect of creating
a parser for Romanian.
Increasing the density of relations between
synsets in order to make RoWN more effective
in applications was obtained by adding deriva-
tional relations. Although they are relations be-
tween literals, the semantic labels we attached to
them can be viewed as a link between the synsets
to which the respective literals belong. After fin-
ishing the semantic annotation of the derivative
pairs, we could try to expand the network with
automatically derived words. For Romanian an
experiment of automatically deriving words is
reported by Petic (2011), who used very produc-
tive and reliable affixes. With the list of affixes
and their combination possibilities (available at
www.racai.ro/~vergi under Research) that we
have created, we can dare test new cases of au-
tomatic derivation for Romanian.

<abstract confidence="0.999467826086956">There are more than 60 wordnets worldwide; the Romanian wordnet is among those that are maintained and further developed. Begun within the BalkaNet project and further enriched in various (application oriented) projects, it was used in word sense disambiguation, machine translation and question answering with promising results. We present here the latest qualitative and quantitative improvements of our lexical resource, special attention being paid to derivational relations, the latest statistics, as well as the development of an Application Programming Interface, meant to facilitate work with the wordnet, both for its further development purposes and for its use in applications. In the context of creating a common European research infrastructure network, our wordnet is licensed through META-SHARE, being freely available for scientific purposes.</abstract>

This type of relations exists in other wordnets as well: the Turkish WordNet (Bilgin et al., 2004), PWN (Fellbaum et al., 2007), the Czech WordNet (Pala and Hlaváčková, 2007), the Polish WordNet (Piasecki et al., 2012), the Estonian one (Kahusk, et al., 2010). Given the language-specific character of such relations, each team undertook their own strategy for finding the relations in their wordnet. However, there are teams that transferred the derivational relations in PWN and then validated them: this is the case for the Bulgarian WordNet (Koeva, 2008), the Serbian (Koeva et al., 2008) and the Finnish one (Lindén and Niemi, 2013). Whereas most of the undertakings above aimed at expanding the network with new synsets derivationally linked with the literals already in the wordnet, we were interested in adding such relations between literals that are in the synsets.

The most important I/O function is reading and writing RoWordNet objects in their native XML format. The &apos;op&apos; package provides different operational tools: (1) set operation methods for joining, intersecting, complementing, etc., multiple RoWordNet objects; (2) through the BFWalk class, the ability to perform a breadth-first walk through the RoWN semantic network; (3) a number of distance-based and semantic similarity measures (Resnik, 1995) for measuring the closeness of concepts (lexicalized by literals in synsets). The &apos;wsd&apos; package implements two Word Sense Disambiguation algorithms: Lesk (1986) and an adapted version of Lesk. They are used to obtain information content values for synsets in RoWN given an arbitrary Romanian text as the input corpus, which is further used to enable the semantic similarity measures. 6 Conclusions and Further Work RoWN is a valuable resource for the Romanian language and the NLP group of RACAI uses it in most of their applications. We presented here our latest qualitative and quantitative achievements. Further enrichment of RoWN is a constant preoccupation of our team. It follows all the time the other interests of the group.

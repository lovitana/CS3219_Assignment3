Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999856">
This paper describes a new methodology for
developing CAT tools that assist translators of
technical and scientific texts by (i) on-the-fly
highlight of nominal and verbal terminology in a
source language (SL) document that lifts possible
syntactic ambiguity and thus essentially raises the
document readability and (ii) simultaneous
translation of all SL document one- and multi-
component lexical units. The methodology is
based on a language-independent hybrid extraction
technique used for document analysis, and
language-dependent shallow linguistic knowledge.
It is targeted at intelligent output and
computationally attractive properties. The approach
is illustrated by its implementation into a CAT tool
for the Russian-English language pair. Such tools
can also be integrated into full MT systems.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99975136">
Exploding volume of professional publications
demand operative international exchange of
scientific and technical information and thus put
in focus operativeness and quality of translation
services. In spite of the great progress of MT that
saves translation time, required translation
quality so far cannot be achieved without human
judgment (Koehn, 2009). Therefore in great
demand are CAT tools designed to support and
facilitate human translation.
CAT tools are developed to automate
postediting and often involve controlled
language. The most popular tools are translation
memory (TM) tools whose function is to save the
translation units in a database so that they can be
re-used through special &amp;quot;fuzzy search&amp;quot; features.
The efficiency of TM (as well as translation
quality as such) is directly related to the problem
of the comprehensiveness of multilingual
lexicons. A translator who, as a rule, does not
possess enough of expert knowledge in a
scientific or technological domain spends about
75% of time for translating terminology, which
do not guarantee the correctness of translation
equivalents she/he uses. The percentage of
mistakes in translating professional terminology
reaches 40% (Kudashev, 2007). It is therefore
essential to develop methodologies that could
help human translators solve this problem, the
huge resource being the Internet, if properly
used. In this paper we suggest one of the
possible ways to do so.
We would like to address the importance of
text readability in the human translation
performance. Readability relates to (though does
not coincide with) the notion of translatability
in MT research. Readability in human translation
is associated with the level of clarity of a SL text
for human understanding. Every translator
knows how difficult it can be to understand
professional texts, not only because of the
abundance of terminology but also due to
complex syntax and syntactic ambiguity. The
ultimate example of a low readability text is the
patent claim (Shinmori et al., 2003) that is
written in the form of one nominal sentence with
extremely complex “inhuman” syntactic
structure that can run for a page or more. Low
readability is often the case with scientific and
technical papers as well.

Workshop on Humans and Computer-assisted Translation, pages 22–27,
Gothenburg, Sweden, 26 April 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics
In this paper we describe our effort to develop a
portable between domains and languages CAT
tool that can on-the-fly improve the readability
of professional texts and provide for reliable
terminology translation.
We paid special attention to multiword noun
terminology, the most frequent and important
terminological unit in special texts that can rarely
be found in full in existing lexicons. When
translated properly, multicomponent NPs do not
only provide for the correct understanding of the
corresponding target language (TL) term but in
many cases lift syntactic ambiguity.
The tool can find a broad application, e.g., it
can be useful for any non-SL speaker for a quick
document digest. The settings of the tool allow
the extraction of keyword translation pairs in
case it is needed, e.g., for search purposes. It can
also be integrated into a full MT system.
We implemented our methodology into a
fully functional tool for the Russian-English
language pair and conducted experiments for
other domains and language pairs. In selecting
Russian as a first SL we were motivated by two
major considerations. Firstly, Russia has a huge
pool of scientific and technical papers which are
unavailable for non-Russian speakers without
turning to expensive translation services.
Secondly, our scientific challenge was to develop
a hybrid methodology applicable to inflecting
languages. Popular SMT and hybrid techniques
working well on configurational and
morphologically poor languages, such as
English, fail on non-configurational languages
with rich morphology (Sharoff, 2004). Russian is
an ultimate example of such a language. It has a
free word order; a typical Russian word has from
9 (for nouns) up to 50 forms (for verbs). In what
follows we first present the tool and then
describe the underlying methodology.

The left pane displays a SL interactive text of a scientific paper in mathematical modelling with
explicitly marked (bold faced) nominal terminology and verbs (in blue). The left pane contains the
alphabetically ordered list of all 1-4 component Russian terms with their English equivalents. On the
top of the right pane there is a type-in area which permits searching for the translations of terms longer
than 4 words in the tool knowledge base. The second bookmark on the top of the Ru-En equivalent
area allows opening a user dictionary for the user to collect terms she/he might need in the future.

2 The Tool
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999555">
The tool takes a SL text an as input and on the
fly produces output at two levels:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.933257">
• a marked-up interactive SL text with
highlighted multi-component nominal and
verbal terminology (NPs and VPs);
• a list of all single- and multi-component SL-
TL units found in the input text.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999844296296296">
Text mark-up improves input readability and
helps translator quicker and better understand the
syntactic structure of the input. This feature
combined with on-the-fly translation of all 1-4
component SL text lexical units reduces
translation time and effort and raises translation
quality. The tool can be used as an e-dictionary
where terms are searched through a type-in area
in the user interface.
Translation equivalents are normalized as
follows. SL NPs are outputted in nominative
singular, while VPs are presented in a finite form
keeping the SL voice, tense and number features.
For example, in the Russian-to-English tool the
Russian VP wordform “auoxmupoeaxxbie”_past
participle, perfective, plural (literally “done”)
will be outputted as “auoxmupoeaxbi”_ finite,
past, plural = “were mounted”.
The tool user interface has a lot of effort-saving
functionalities. A click on a unit in the marked
up input text in the left pane highlights its TL
equivalent in the alphabetically sorted list of
translations on the right pane. It is possible to
create user dictionaries accumulating
terminology from different texts, saving these
dictionaries and projects, etc. A screenshot of
the user interface in shown in Figure 1.

3 Methodology and Development Issues
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996751">
3.1 Architecture
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985314461538461">
The overall architecture of the tool is shown in
Figure 2. The tool engine consists of a shallow
analyzer including three fully automatic
modules, - a SL hybrid NP extractor, shallow
parser and imbedded machine translation module
meant to translate terminology. The knowledge
base contains shallow linguistic knowledge, -
lexicons and rules.
The NP extractor is a hybrid stand-alone tool
pipelined to the system. We built it following the
methodology of NP extraction for the English
language as described in (Sheremetyeva, 2009)
and ported it to the Russian language.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.996499">

</figureCaption>
<page confidence="0.992063">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905423076923">
The extraction methodology combines statistical
techniques, heuristics and very shallow linguistic
knowledge. The knowledge base consists of a
number of unilingual lexicons, - sort of extended
lists of stop words forbidden in particular (first,
middle or last) positions in a typed lexical unit
(Russian NP in our case).
NP extraction procedure starts with n-gram
calculation and then removes n-grams, which
cannot be NPs by successive matching
components of calculated n-grams against the
stop lexicons. The extraction itself thus neither
requires such demanding NLP procedures, as
tagging, morphological normalization, POS
pattern match, etc., nor does it rely on statistical
counts (statistical counts are only used to sort out
keywords). The latter makes this extraction
methodology suitable for inflecting languages
(Russian in our case) where frequencies of n-
grams are low.
Porting the NP extractor from English to
Russian consisted in substituting English stop
lexicons of the tool with the Russian equivalents.
We did this by translating each of the English
stop lists into Russian using a free online system
PROMT (http://www.translate.ru) followed by
manual brush-up.
The NP extractor does not rely on a
preconstructed corpus, works on small texts,
does not miss low frequency units and can
reliably extract all NPs from an input text. We
excluded a lemmatizer from the original
extraction algorithm and kept all extracted
Russian NPs in their textual forms. The noun
phrases thus extracted are of 1 to 4 components
due to the limitations of the extractor that uses a
4-gram model. The extractor was also used for
lexicon acquisition.
The shallow parser consists of an NP
chunker, VP chunker and tagger. The first users
the knowledge dynamically produced by the NP
extractor (lists of all NPs of an input text in their
text form). The VP chunker and tagger turn to
the Russian entries of the tool bilingual lexicon.
The tagger is actually a supertagger as it assigns
supertags coding all morphological features, such
as part-of-speech, number, gender, tense, etc.
The machine translation module translates
text chunks into English using simple transfer
and generation rules working over the space of
supertags as found in the CAT tool bilingual
lexicon.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999662">
3.2 Bilingual lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944170731707">
To ensure correct terminology translation the
bilingual lexicon of the tool should necessarily
be tuned to a specific domain for which it is to be
used. The lexicon is organized as a set of shallow
cross-referenced monolingual entries of lexical
units listed with their part-of-speech class and
explicit paradigms of domain-relevant
wordforms. This is the type of resource that,
once build for some other purpose, can be simply
fed into the system. Acquisition of this type of
knowledge for every new pair of languages is
what existing SMT tools can provide either in
advance or on the fly, as reported in (2012 et
al.,). In our work striving for correctness we
combined automatic techniques with manual
check and manual acquisition.
The Russian vocabulary was created in two
steps. First, an initial corpus of Russian
scientific papers on mathematical modelling of
approximately 80 000 wordforms was acquired
on Internet. We then ported the NP extractor
described above to other Russian parts-of-speech
and automatically extracted domain specific
typed lexical units (NPs, VPs, ADJs, etc)
consisting of 1 up to 4 components from the
corpus. These automatically extracted lists of
lexemes were further checked by human
acquirers and 14 000 of them were used as a seed
Russian vocabulary.
The seed vocabulary was then used to acquire
longer Russian lexemes both from the initial
corpus, and the Internet, which is in fact an
unlimited corpus. The following methodology
was applied. The seed lexical units were used as
keywords in the Internet search engines. New
Russian terminological units including seed
terms highlighted in the two first pages of the
search results were included in the lexicon. For
example, for the seed (key) term
Knceedoo6paugexue» the following multi-
component terms popped-up on the Internet:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.923902333333333">
Knceedoo6paufexue conpRafcexuou cucmeMSi»,
Knceedoo6pau{exue Mampuq C BsipoaFcdexxsLUu
Becauu», Knceedoo6pau{exue Mypa-Hexpoy3a»,
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999536444444444">
etc. As a result, the seed Russian vocabulary was
extended to 60 000 single- and multi-component
units up to seven-eight words long.
Lexical acquisition of English equivalents was
done based on existing domain lexicons,
parallel/comparable corpora and raw Internet
resources. The last needs to be explained. In case
neither existing lexicons, nor parallel/comparable
corpora could provide for a reliable English

<bodyText confidence="0.965666594594595">
equivalent, which was mostly the case with long
terms, translation hypotheses were made based
on different combinations of translation variants
of component words. Every translation
hypothesis was then checked in the Internet
search engine. If an engine (we used Google)
showed a translation version in the search results,
the hypothesis was considered confirmed and the
English equivalent was included in the tool
lexicon. For example, the Russian term «poeeoe
npedcmaenexue uacmutibi» could not be found in
any of existing lexicons, the following English
equivalents of the Russian term components
were found:
pou – swarm; npedcmaenexue - conception,
expression, representation, performance,
configuration; uacmutia – bit, fraction, particle,
shard, corpuscle.
If you create a translation hypothesis by using
the first translation variant for every component
of the Russian term you will get: Kswarm
conception of a bit» or Kbit swarm conception».
Used as key words in Google, the search results
do not contain these words combined in a term.
This translation hypothesis was rejected. Another
hypothesis Kparticle swarm representation» used
as key words in Google gives the English term
KParticle Swarm Optimization and Priority
Representation» from the paper on mathematical
modelling by Philip Brooks, a native English
speaker. «Particle swarm representation» is
accepted as a correct English translation of the
Russian term «poeeoe npedcmamexue
uacmutibi». Though tedious, this methodology
allowed careful detection of the up-to-date
highly reliable translation that could hardly
be achieved otherwise.

3.3 Workflow
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999984483870968">
The raw SL document first goes to the automatic
NP extractor, which produces a list of one- to
four component noun phrases. The dynamically
created NP list is then used as knowledge for the
NP chunker, which by matching the extracted list
against the input text chunks (brackets) noun
phrases in the document. The morphological
tagger completes morphological analysis of these
chunks by looking them up in the NP entries of
the tool lexicon. The text strings between
chunked NPs is then supplied to the VP chunker
that matches this input against verb wordforms,
as listed in the morphological zones of verb
entries. In case of a match the text string is
chunked as VP and a corresponding supertag
from the lexicon is assigned. The text strings
which were left between NP and VP chunks are
then looked up in the rest of the entries of the
lexicon and tagged. The fact that in every
chunking/tagging pass only the type-relevant
lexicon entries are searched practically lifts the
ambiguity problem in morphological analysis.
Finally, based on classified chunk borders, the
document is turned into an interactive
(“clickable”) text with NP and VP phrases
highlighted in different colours.
The output of the shallow analysis stage (fully
(super) tagged lexical units) is passed to the
machine translation module that following
simple rules generates SL-TL lexical pairs for all
the lexica of the text (See Figure 1).

4 Status and Conclusions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979882352941">
The viability of the methodology we have
described was proved by its implementation in a
Russian-English CAT tool for the domain of
scientific papers on mathematical modelling. The
tool is fully developed. The domain bilingual
static knowledge sources have been carefully
crafted based on corpora analysis and internet
resources. The programming shell of the tool is
language independent and provides for
knowledge administration in all the tool modules
to improve their performance.
The extractor of Russian nominal terminology
currently performs with 98, 4 % of recall and 96,
1% precision. The shallow clunker based on the
extraction results and lexicon shows even higher
accuracy. This is explained, on the one hand, by
the high performance of the NP extractor, and,
on the other hand, by the nature of inflecting
languages. Rich morphology turns out to be an
advantage in our approach. Great variety of
morphological forms lowers ambiguity between
NP components and verb paradigms.
We could not yet find any publications
describing research meant for similar output.
This leaves the comparison between other
methodologies/tools and ours as a future work. In
general user evaluation results show a reasonably
small number of failures that are being improved
by brushing up the bilingual lexicon.
We intend to a) improve the quality of the tool
by updating the tool knowledge based on the user
feedback; b) integrate the tool into a full MT
system and c) develop a search facility on the
basis of the our extraction strategy.

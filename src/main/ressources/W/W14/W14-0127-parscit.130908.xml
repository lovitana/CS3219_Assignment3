This paper addresses problems in equiva-
lence among concepts, within and be-
tween languages. The Kamusi Project has
begun building a massively multilingual
dictionary that relates as many languages
as possible for which data can be gath-
ered. In the process, we have encountered
numerous complexities that we attempt to
address through the design of our data
structure. This paper presents the issues
we have encountered, and discusses the
solutions that we have developed.

<bodyText confidence="0.999942705882353">
True synonyms are rare within a language, if
synonyms are taken to be words that can stand in
each other’s place in all contexts. Even if you
cannot propose a whisper’s difference between
the ideas of “snuggling” and “cuddling”, you can
“snuggle against” someone, but you cannot
“cuddle against” them. In Swahili, “ndovu” and
“tembo” are completely interchangeable when
talking about elephants, but bring you different
brands of beer when you ask for them in a bar.
Each word must thus be treated differently in a
dictionary, so that its particular nuances can be
elaborated.
Between languages, it is quite common that
terms exist for exactly the same concept. When
speaking of colors, English “red” evokes essen-
tially the same bloody hue as “rouge” in French
or “nyekundu” in Swahili. An “elephant” is an
elephant, whether it is “elephant” or “ndovu”.
“Beer” and “biere” and “bia” are all beer. How-
ever, we do not expect other senses of a word to
map identically in translation; we anticipate that
a “red” grape in English might be “noir” in
French.
These issues are not new to lexicographers,
and this paper will not claim to advance our un-
derstanding of synonymy; a trio of recent articles
in the International Journal of Lexicography
(2013) by Adamska-Sałaciak, Gouws, and Mur-
phy provide the context from which this paper is
launched. What is new is the system that Kamusi
is developing to produce a global dictionary that
can catalogue synonyms within and across lan-
guages, and account for their subtle differences.

2 Monolingual Pillars and Multilingual
Beams
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971745">
The basic architecture of Kamusi was developed
to handle cases like the examples above, which
we now think of as the easy ones. The initial
structure is two dimensional, with vertical pillars
and horizontal beams.
The vertical axis is the monolingual entry for
a term. Within a language, each term is entitled
to as many entries as that particular sequence of
letters has senses; “light” (not dark) is a different
entry from “light” (not heavy) or “light” (not se-
rious) or “light” (low calorie). Those entries can
then be segregated into groups, so that a “light”
(flame for a cigarette) is grouped with the verb
“light” (ignite a fire) while “light” (a lamp) is
grouped with “light” (a traffic signal). Within
groups, entries can be ranked, so that “light” (a
lamp) is listed above “light” (a traffic signal).
The groups themselves can be ranked on a scien-
tific or whimsical basis – a corpus count would
place the groups for light (energy) and light
(lamps) high on the list, but the decision about
where to rank light comedy versus light soda can
only be arbitrary. This vertical structure provides
all the space needed to engage in the lexico-
graphical challenge of giving a definition to each
of a term’s different senses. In order to support
the horizontal beams, no entry is deemed com-
plete in Kamusi unless it includes a definition
written in its own language.
The horizontal axis is the same concept as ex-
pressed in different languages. “Light” (not dark)
can be expressed with some term in German,
another term in Japanese, and another one in
Songhay. Once a concept from one language has
been determined to be equivalent to a particular
entry for a different language that is already in
the system, we take the relationship to be transi-
tive across all the other equivalents in all the oth-
er languages in the system. Because “red” for
colors and “red” for grapes are two different en-
tries on the vertical pillar in English, they con-
nect to different horizontal beams, and we can
weld on terms in different languages that match
those varying concepts:
Red (color of blood) H rouge H nyekundu
1
Red (color of wine) H rouge H nyekundu
1
Red (color of grapes) H noir H zambarau
In this schema, “rouge” in French has its
own monolingual pillar (color of blood, color of
wine, type of cosmetic), as does “noir”. It is clear
what terms gloss each other between languages –
one would not look up “red” and mistakenly use
the color of blood to talk about grapes in either
French or Swahili. Horizontal beams work per-
fectly when concepts are essentially the same
across languages.

3 Mapping Inexact Concepts
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99983325">
Unfortunately for our architecture, however, lan-
guages do not map on a simple one-to-one basis.
We have had to address five major problems
with the internal wiring of our edifice.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.942925142857143">
1) Partial equivalence
2) No equivalent term
3) Different forms
4) Different parts of speech
5) Synonyms within a language
1. Partial equivalence. In English, we have ten
fingers and ten toes, and the Dutch have ten
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999811435294118">
“vingers” and ten “tenen”. Romanians, however,
have twenty “degete”, and Swahili speakers have
twenty “vidole”. Nowhere is this a problem for
glove makers, but it wreaks havoc for a multilin-
gual dictionary. English and Dutch are full
equivalents, as are Romanian and Swahili, but
those two sets only partially match each other.
Thus, the flow of transitivity is broken, and the
nature of the partial relationships is ambiguous.
When establishing a relationship between
terms in Kamusi, a contributor specifies whether
they are “parallel”, “similar”, or “explanatory”
(see the next section). Terms that are designated
as “similar” disrupt the welding of the horizontal
beam. We know that items that are added as par-
allel to “finger” will be transitive to the first set,
and items that are parallel to “vidole” are parallel
to the second set, and we can also infer the same
similarity between new terms on either side of
the divide. However, we cannot infer any inher-
ent relationship between similarities that have
not been documented; a language that had terms
for each individual finger but no overriding cate-
gory term, for example, would be similar to fin-
ger and vinger in a different way than it is similar
to kidole and deget, and differently than the simi-
larity between finger/vinger H deget/kidole. The
programming to chart similarities between transi-
tive groups is not complete as of this writing.
Forthcoming programming will include two
new features for similarities. First, each relation-
ship pair will have a descriptive field in which
differences can be explained in writing, in multi-
ple languages. Second, users will be able to vote
on the level of similarity (close, distant, barely
comparable), and the votes can be aggregated
into a graphic such as a Venn diagram to alert
dictionary users about potential dangers in
equivalence.
Partial equivalence is also addressed within
Kamusi’s vertical pillars. As discussed, each
sense should have a definition of a term written
in its own language. Each of these definitions
can be further translated into any other language.
Thus, an English definition of “finger” would
refer to the ten digits of the hand, and the Roma-
nian and Swahili translations of that definition,
stored within the English concept of “finger”,
would also discuss the ten digits of the hand.
Conversely, the Romanian definition of “deget”
would refer to both hands and feet, and the Eng-
lish translation of that definition within the Ro-
manian entry would contain that clarifying in-
formation for English readers.
2. No equivalent term. Numerous concepts that
exist in one language do not exist in another. For
example, Japanese has a term “torii” (鳥g) for
the ceremonial gate to a Shinto shrine seen in the
images above. “Torii” is not an English word,
but we need a way to describe it in a Japanese-
English dictionary. Our solution is to create an
entry on the English side that is labeled “ex-
planatory” of the Japanese term: “Shinto gate”.
This term does not become part of the larger
English lexicon, but will be visible when a user
looks up “torii” in Japanese or conducts a direct
English-Japanese search.
Explanatory phrases come with their own
complications. “Shinto gate” is an endpoint on
the horizontal beam; one can add a French ex-
planatory phrase for “torii”, but that will not link
to the English explanation. However, Okinawan
does have the concept, and uses the term トリイ
(torii). In this case, the relationship between Jap-
anese and Okinawan is transitive, so we assume
that English “Shinto gate” is explanatory of the
Okinawan and any other languages that enter the
parallel set.
Parallel relationships cannot be automatically
inferred from explanations in the current Kamusi
system. For example, “-simulia” in Swahili and
“a povesti” in Romanian are both explained in
English with the phrase “tell a story”, but that
relationship is not easily discoverable. Future
programming will address this gap.

3. Different forms. Two languages might have
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.896975569444444">
the same concept, represented by the same part
of speech, but approached from different direc-
tions. For example, placing a passive suffix on
the Swahili verb “-abiri” (travel as a passenger)
produces the verb “-abiriwa”, which can translate
to English as “be crossed” in the sense that a riv-
er is crossed by a ferry. Such misalignments oc-
cur ad infinitum between Bantu languages and
English, and similar form differences occur
throughout the data.
Kamusi has a tidy system for handling differ-
ent forms of a word (although we do not have a
tidy term, since neither “morphemes” nor “in-
flections” cover the concept; our current candi-
date is the coinage “morphlections”). When a
language has a manageable number N of
morphlections, such as the four possible forms of
a Portuguese adjective, we create N minus one
additional input boxes for that part of speech,
which we label during the setup process (e.g.,
feminine singular, masculine plural, and femi-
nine plural). A more automated system for large
conjugation sets such as Romance verbs is on the
agenda, and a fully automated system for ma-
chine-predictable agglutination parsing has al-
ready been developed for Swahili and should be
transferable (not without tears) to languages from
German to Xhosa.
This morphlection system makes it possible to
list forms that do not normally appear in diction-
aries, such as the passive verb form in English. “-
Abiriwa” can then be linked to “be crossed”
within the correct sense entry of “cross” (not be-
tray, nor intersect, etc.). Everything that one
needs to know in order to make sense of “be
crossed” is contained within the English entry (it
is the passive form of a verb meaning “to pass
from one side to the other”), without having to
create a full separate English entry to accommo-
date the Swahili formation. It also becomes pos-
sible to link morphlections from one language to
morphlections in another, such as mapping the
English past participle “crossed” to the French
past participle “traverse”. A search for a
morphlection will pull up the full result for the
canonical form, but show any relevant inter-
language links for the morphlection as well.
4. Different parts of speech. Although you may
think your watch is on your left wrist, with “left”
as an adjective, in Kirundi it is on your wrist left-
ly, with “bubamfu” as an adverb. Similarly, the
verb “achtgeben” in German is expressed in Eng-
lish as an auxiliary verb plus an adjective, “be
careful”, and in French as an auxiliary verb plus
a noun, “faire attention”. A green cigar may be
just a cigar with an adjective, but it greens as a
verb (“guun”) in the Aukan language of Suri-
name.
A monolingual dictionary should contain only
the terms that exist in that language; “careful” is
an English term, whereas “be careful” is a non-
problematic construction of two terms that has
no home in any English dictionary consulted for
this paper, nor in the Princeton WordNet. Bilin-
gual dictionaries, however, need ways to show
how terms in one language are expressed in the
other. As shown in the example below from
WordReference.com, showing equivalence be-
tween languages in such cases is a struggle;
“achtgeben” is glossed as “be careful”, but “be
careful” is shown on the English side as a usage
example that does not track back to “achtgeben”.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999764675925927">
The Kamusi solution is to provide fields for
“bridges”. Though not implemented as of this
writing, the monolingual entry for a term will
also include the option for a contributor to “add a
bridge” for a part of speech. The English adjec-
tive “careful” can be augmented with the verb
bridge “be careful”, and the French noun “atten-
tion” can have the verb bridge “faire attention”.
The English and French items can then be linked
to German and become connected transitively
along the horizontal beam, or they can be linked
directly without the German intermediary. In
either case, we do not crowd the monolingual
side of a dictionary with unnecessary entries for
differently-structured concepts from other lan-
guages, but we include the necessary information
and make it discoverable.
5. Synonyms within a language. The Kamusi
structure makes it easy to attach a synonym to a
single sense of a word, such as matching “trav-
erse” only to the sense of “cross” as passing from
one side to the other. However, we face three
additional challenges: a) whether the terms are
exact equivalents, b) whether one term is pre-
ferred to another, and c) how they act in transi-
tive translation sets.
a. When presenting glosses between lan-
guages, one has some latitude to stretch the
notion of exact equivalence between terms;
English “stool” can be linked as equivalent to
Swahili “kigoda” even though a typical stool
is much higher above the ground than a typical
kigoda. Within a language, though, the subtle
differences between terms arguably take on
more significance. “Think” and “ponder” are
synonyms in the WordNet sense of “reflect
deeply on a subject”, but there is a nuanced
difference of degree.
As with bilingual glosses, forthcoming pro-
gramming will provide the opportunity to catego-
rize a synonym relationship as parallel or similar.
Users will have the opportunity to rate the close-
ness of similar terms, and a comment field will
provide the opportunity to stipulate the ways that
synonyms differ. In the above example, “think”
and “ponder” would likely be shown as parallel
for the specific sense, but a comment that ad-
heres to the relationship might explain that pon-
dering is a somewhat more intense activity.
b. Within a group of terms that are listed as syn-
onyms, a system is needed to rank those that are
more prevalent. This is especially important
when showing the set within a translation result,
because language learners will have little inde-
pendent basis to judge which term to use. A stu-
dent of English would be hard pressed to select a
best choice from among the options in the
WordNet synset: “chew over, think over, medi-
tate, ponder, excogitate, contemplate, muse, re-
flect, mull, mull over, ruminate, speculate”. A
chief complaint that Swahili teachers have about
the Kamusi Project is that students tend to use
the first entry of a search result, even if the dis-
play is alphabetical because the result has not yet
been ranked, so essays are often submitted with
some rather strange choices of vocabulary.
Without a ranking system, English students
worldwide will chew over problems more often
than they ponder them, and they will excogitate
more than they contemplate.
We have developed a simple tool (currently
not online due to a change in our programming
platform) that allows contributors to slide entries
in a set up or down in relation to each other. A
set can ultimately be locked down by a modera-
tor, but we see the ranking tool as lightweight
work that is a good use of crowd-source energy.
Synonyms cannot easily be ranked based on cor-
pus frequency results, because the work of de-
termining the specific senses of homonyms is
prohibitive. Future programming will simplify
crowdsourcing even more, posing questions to
users such as, “’Ponder’ and ‘think’ are both de-
fined as ‘to reflect deeply on a subject.’ Which
do you use more often?” Without digressing into
our plans for building Kamusi data through tight-
ly-controlled input from the crowd, we can still
propose that aggregated voting results will pro-
vide a somewhat scientific method to rank terms
within a set of synonyms.
c. Monolingual synonyms within multilingual
translation sets. “Ndovu” and “tembo” are both
translations of “elephant” and “6l6phant”, but
they are not translations of each other. In future,
were we to link “ndovu” to “elephant” as a paral-
lel translation, and then link “tembo” and “ele-
phant”, Kamusi will be savvy enough to recog-
nize that “ndovu” and “tembo” are the same lan-
guage, and therefore synonyms rather than trans-
lations. Conversely, if we have a set of synonyms
in one language, and we link one of those terms
to a term in another language, then we can create
a transitive translation relationship for each of
those synonyms. The coding for this feature will
follow significant refinements to the behavior of
translation sets that have just been completed as
of this writing, with ramifications described in
the conclusion.

4. Concluding thoughts: Integration with the
Global WordNet
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999977323529412">
The questions of synonymy raised above are, of
course, not new to WordNet. What is new is the
potential that the Kamusi system offers for fine-
tuning relationships identified as synonymous
within a language, and for charting those identi-
fied semantic links across language WordNets.
As an example, the Princeton WordNet con-
tains the synset: car/ auto/ automobile/ machine/
motorcar. UWN/MENTA maps the sense of that
synset to the following French equivalents: au-
tomobile/ auto/ bagnole/ voiture/ wagon, and
similar clusters or single terms in many other
languages.
Tying five terms identified as synonyms in
English with five terms identified as synonyms
in French creates 25 pairs, each of which needs
to be differentiated from homonyms on both
sides. When the programming resources are
available, Kamusi proposes to address this chal-
lenge through a process that engages the crowd
to validate synsets within a language, and their
glosses across languages. In the above example,
crowd consensus might push “machine” out of
the English synset, or bring “wheels” into the
group. A similar process would be in effect on
the French side. When a link is established be-
tween any item within a set of synonyms in one
language, and another item within a set of syno-
nyms in another language, then the computer
establishes the existence of a relationship among
all the entities.
What is significant about these links from one
synonym to the next, and from one translation to
the next, however, is that they are not absolute.
With programming completed just in time for
this paper to go to press, Kamusi charts degrees
of separation between links that have been vali-
dated by humans and those that have been in-
ferred by transitivity algorithms. Those degrees
of separation will track through intra-language
synonyms. Thus, if “wheels” is human-linked to
“car”, “car” is linked by hand to “voiture”, and
“voiture” is manually linked to “bagnole”, then
“wheels” and “bagnole” will be shown to be sep-
arated by three degrees. This will enable readers
to make an educated judgment about the tight-
ness of the association between any two terms. In
addition, knowledgeable users will be able to
help confirm, reject, or add nuance to computer-
predicted linkages.
The programming to implement a smooth in-
tegration of WordNet data within the Kamusi
framework has not yet advanced out of the con-
ceptual stage, for two reasons. First, a variety of
other tasks must be completed in order for work-
ing with WordNet data to be practical, particular-
ly reestablishment of the grouping tool in a mul-
tilingual context, certain behaviors of morphlec-
tions, and the big upcoming task of developing
an effective system of working with the crowd.
Second, finances. Once those elements are in
order, and we have had further conversations
with members of the WordNet community to
refine our approach, we look forward to seeing
what can happen when we connect the extensive
multilingual WordNet data sets with the lexico-
graphical potential that the Kamusi framework
makes possible.

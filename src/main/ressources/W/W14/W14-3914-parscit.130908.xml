Code-Mixing is a frequently observed
phenomenon in social media content gen-
erated by multi-lingual users. The pro-
cessing of such data for linguistic analysis
as well as computational modelling is
challenging due to the linguistic complex-
ity resulting from the nature of the mixing
as well as the presence of non-standard
variations in spellings and grammar, and
transliteration. Our analysis shows the ex-
tent of Code-Mixing in English-Hindi
data. The classification of Code-Mixed
words based on frequency and linguistic
typology underline the fact that while
there are easily identifiable cases of bor-
rowing and mixing at the two ends, a large
majority of the words form a continuum in
the middle, emphasizing the need to han-
dle these at different levels for automatic
processing of the data.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999652">
The past decade has seen an explosion of Com-
puter Mediated Communication (CMC) world-
wide (Herring 2003). CMC provides users with
multiple options, both asynchronous and synchro-
nous, like email, chat, and more recently, social
media like Facebook and Twitter (Isharayanti et al
2009, Paolillo 2011). This form of communica-
tion raises interesting questions on language use
across these media. Language use in CMC lies
somewhere in between spoken and written forms

of a language, and tend to use simple shorter con-
structions, contractions, and phrasal repetitions
typical of speech (Dannett and Herring 2007)
Such conversations, especially in social-media are
also multi-party and multilingual, with switching
between, and mixing of two or more languages,
the choice of language-use being highly influ-
enced by the speakers and their communicative
goals (Crystal 2001).
Code-Switching and Code-Mixing are stable and
well-studied linguistic phenomena of multilingual
speech communities. Code-Switching is “juxta-
position within the same speech exchange of pas-
sages of speech belonging to two different gram-
matical systems or sub-systems” (Gumperz 1982),
and Code-Mixing refers to the embedding of lin-
guistic units such as phrases, words and mor-
phemes of one language into an utterance of an-
other language (Myers-Scotton 1993, 2002).
Thus, Code-Switching is usually inter-sentences
while Code-Mixing (CM) is an intra-sentential
phenomenon. Linguists believe that there exists a
continuum in the manner in which a lexical item
transfers from one to another of two languages in
contact (Myers-Scotton 2002, Thomason 2003).
Example (1) below illustrates the phenomenon of
Code-Switching, while (2) shows Code-Mixing.

The main view held by linguists being that a lexi-
cal item goes from being used as a foreign word
to a valid loanword indistinguishable from the na-
tive vocabulary by virtue of repeated use and
adoption of morpho-syntactic features of the re-
cipient language (Auer 1984). However, in the
case of single words, most scholars agree that it is
difficult to determine whether or not a word is a
“bona fide loanword/borrowing” or an instance of
nonce borrowing2 or CM (Alex 2008, Bentahila
and Davies, 1991, Field 2002, Myers-Scotton
2002, Winford 2003). In this study, we only con-
sider Code-mixing examples, i.e., intra-sentential
embedding of a language in another language.
Processing such language data is challenging
from the perspective of linguistic understanding
vis-à-vis discourse and conversational analysis, as
well as computational modelling and applications
to Machine Translation, Information Retrieval
and Natural Interfaces. Especially, in the case of
social-media content where there are added com-
plications due to contractions, non-standard spell-
ings, and ungrammatical constructions as well as
mixing of scripts. Many languages that use non-
Roman scripts, like Hindi, Bangla, Chinese, Ara-
bic etc., are often represented using Roman trans-
literations (Virga and Khudanpur 2003, Sowmya
et al 2010). This poses additional challenges of ac-
curately identifying and separating the two lan-
guages. Further, it is often difficult to disambigu-
ate a borrowing as a valid native vocabulary from
a mixing of a second language when dealing with
single words. An understanding of the nature of
mixing in such data is one of the first steps to-
wards processing this data and hence, making a
more natural interaction in CMC a real possibility.
2 1once-borrowings are typically borrowings that do
not necessarily follow any phonological, morpho-syn-
tactic or sociolinguistic constraints on their assimila-
tion into the host language (Poplack et al 1988). How-
ever, it is not clear if this is always a defining feature
In this paper, we analyze social media content
from English-Hindi (En-Hin) bilingual users to
better understand CM in such data. We look at the
extent of CM in both Hindi embedding in English,
as well as English in Hindi. Our analysis of the
type of CM in this context based on frequency of
use and linguistic typology helps further an under-
standing of the different kinds of CM employed
by users and emphasizes the need to tackle these
at different levels.

2 Corpus Creation and Annotation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9496092">
For the creation of corpus for studying En-Hin
CM, data from public Facebook pages in which
En-Hin bilinguals are highly active was consid-
ered appropriate. Hence, we chose the Facebook
pages of three Indian public figures, two promi-
nent Bollywood stars viz, Amitabh Bachchan and
Shahrukh Khan, and the then-PM-elect Narendra
Modi. We also collected data from the BBC Hindi
News page. The assumption was that Bollywood,
politics and news being three very popular areas
of interest for Indians, we would see a lot of activ-
ity from the community on these pages. A total of
40 posts from Oct 22- 28, 2013 were manually
collected and preference was given to posts hav-
ing a long (50+) thread of comments. This is be-
cause CM and non-standard use of language is
more frequent in comments. In the rest of the pa-
per, we shall use the term posts to cover both com-
ments and posts. The data was semi-automatically
cleaned and formatted, removing user names for
privacy. The names of public figures in the posts
were retained. The final corpus consisted of 6983
between established loanwords and nonce-borrowing,
the line between them being extremely tenuous

While a number of posts were in the Devanagari
script, the largest representation was that of Ro-
man script. A small number of posts were found

2.1 Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999721814285714">
As a first step towards analysis, it is imperative
that an annotation scheme be arrived at that cap-
tures the richness, diversity and uniqueness of the
data. Any analysis of code-mixed CMC language-
use requires inputs at social, contextual, and dif-
ferent linguistic and meta-linguistic levels that op-
erate on various sub-parts of the conversation.
This would help label not only the structural lin-
guistics phenomena such as POS tagging,
Chunks, Phrases, Semantic Roles etc. but also the
various socio-pragmatic contexts (User de-
mographics, Communicative intent, Polarity etc.).
However, an initial attempt at such a rich, layered
annotation proved the task to be immensely re-
source intensive. Hence, for the initial analysis the
annotation scheme was scaled down to four la-
bels:
Matrix: Myers Scotton’s (1993) framework, CM
occurs where one language provides the morpho-
syntactic frame into which a second language in-
serts words and phrases. The former is termed as
the Matrix while the latter is called Embedding.
Usually, matrix language can be assigned to
clauses and sentences.
Following this framework, the annotator was
asked to split all posts into contiguous fragments
of words such that each fragment has a unique ma-
trix language (En or Hin)
Word Origin: Every embedded word is marked
for its origin (En or Hin) depending on whether
the source language was English or Hindi. A word
from a language other than English or Hindi was
marked as Other (Ot). It was assumed that the un-
marked words within a matrix language origi-
nated in that language. In our data we did not find
examples of sub-lexical CM. For example an Eng-
lish word with Hindi inflection like computeron
(कम्प्यूटरों) were the English word “computer” is
inflected by the Hindi plural marker –on. How-
ever, this can be a possible occurrence in En-Hin
CM and needs to be marked as such.
Normalization: Whenever a word in its native
script uses a non-standard spelling (including con-
tractions) it is marked with its correct spellings.
For transliterations of Hindi in Roman script, the
word is marked with the correct spelling in Deva-
nagari script.
POS tagging: Each word is labelled with its POS
tag following the Universal Tagset proposed by
Petrov et al (2011). This tagset uses 12 high-level
tags for main POS classes. While, this tagset is not
good at capturing granularity at a deeper level, we
chose this because of a) its applicability to both
English and Hindi doing away with the need for
any mapping of labels between the two languages,
and b) the small size of the corpus posed serious
doubts on the usefulness of a more granular tagset
for any analysis.
The POS tags were decided on the basis of the
function of the word in a context rather than a de-
contextualized absolute word class. This was done
because often in the case of embedded words, the
lexical category of the original language is com-
pletely lost and it is the function of the word in the
matrix language that applies and assumes im-
portance.
Named Entities: Named Entities (NE) are per-
haps the most common and amongst the first to
form the borrowed or mixed vocabulary in CM.
As the Universal Tagset did not have a separate

<bodyText confidence="0.99892975">
category for NEs, we chose to label and classify
them as people, locations and organizations. It is
important to remember that while NEs are perhaps
the most frequent “borrowings” the notion of
Word Origin in the context of CM is debatable.
However, these need to be analyzed and processed
separately for any NLP application.
1062 posts consisting of 1071 words were ran-
domly selected and annotated by a linguist who is
a native speaker of Hindi and proficient in Eng-
lish. Non-overlapping subsets of the annotations
were then reviewed and corrected by two expert
linguists.
The two annotated examples from the corpus of
En in Hin Matrix and Hin in En Matrix are given
below:

It was observed that a large chunk of data con-
sisted of short posts typically a greeting or a eu-
logy from a fan of the public figures and were un-
interesting from a structural linguistic analysis of
CM. Thus, all such posts (consisting of 5 or less
words) were deleted from the corpus and the re-
maining corpus of 381 posts and 4135 words was
used for further analysis.

3 An Analysis of Code Mixed Data
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995492">
The annotated data consists of 398 Hin sentences,
698 En and 6 Ot in a single language. 45 posts
show at least one switch in matrix between En and
Hin. Thus, at least 4.2% of the data is Code-
Switched. It should be noted however that this is
matrix switching within an utterance. If we con-
sider Code-Switching at a global level to include
switching from one language to another within a
conversation thread then all the threads in the data
show code-switching as they contain utterances
from both English and Hindi.
Looking at the 398 Hindi matrices, we find that
23.7% of them show at least one En embedding as
compared to only 7.2% of the En matrices with
Hin embedding. In total 17.2% of all posts which
consist of nearly a quarter of all words in the data
show some amount of CM.
If we look at the number of points in a single ma-
trix where embedding happens, we find that in
86% of the En matrices, Hin embeddings appear
only once or twice. En embeddings in Hin matrix
is not only twice as more frequent, but can occur
more often in a single matrix (more than 3 times
in at least 10% of the cases). Table 3 shows the
distribution of CM points for both the cases.

As expected, NEs are common in the corpus and
there are a total of 233 NEs in 406 matrices (322
of 4134 words). The distribution of NEs by sub-
classes is given in Table 4.
Table 5 shows the distribution of the various POS
in the entire corpus, as well as for the embedded
words. Nouns do form the largest class of words

overall as well as for Hin as well as En embed-
ding. In fact, for Hin in English matrix, there are
only two instances of words which are not Nouns.
Table 5 shows the distribution of POS for Hin in
En matrix, and En in Hin matrix
Looking at these top-level distributions we can
observe that though there are some similarities be-
tween the patterns of CM for Hin in English and
En in Hindi matrices (the high frequency of
nouns, for instance), they both exhibit distinct pat-
terns in terms of how often CM occurs as well as
in the prevalence of POS other than Nouns. In
Section 3.1 and 3.2 we will look at both these L1
embedding in L2 matrix individually in more de-
tail.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994852">
3.1 Hindi words in English matrix
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996529">
As mentioned above, most of the Hin embedding
in En (32 out of 33) matrices are Nouns. The ex-
ception is variation of the particle “ji” used as an
honorific marker in Hindi. The particle is used to
denote respect and occurs in formulaic expression
of the kind &lt;(name/address form)&gt; ji as in:
“Amit ji, I am your fan and have seen all your
movies”
A closer look at the embedded Hin Nouns shows
that a large number of them are actually part of
multi-word Named Entities which do not fall un-
der the categories defined in the annotation guide-
lines. Almost all of them also function as regular
Nouns or Verbs in Hindi. For example, the word
“hunkaar” (a roar) is not an NE, however its use
in the following sentence, where it is used to de
note the name of a particular rally (event) can be
viewed as an NE.
“hunkar rally will be held tomorrow”
Similarly, the word “yaatraa” in Hindi means
journey whereas its use in the phrase “Kerala
yaatraa” is specific to a tour of Kerala.
There are some instances of nonce-borrowing or
CM where Hindi Nouns are not used as a part of a
potential NE or formulaic expressions. For exam-
ple, in the following sentence:
“...and the party workers (will) come with me
without virodh”
The Hindi word “virodh” is used instead of the
English alternative “protest” or “objection”. It can

guistic or pragmatic reasons to emphasize or hu-

Kinship terms form another domain of frequent
embedding of Hin in En. Hindi has a more com-
plex system of kinship terms where not only are
there finer distinctions maintained between mater-
nal and paternal relations but also kinship terms
are used to address older (and hence) respectable
people. Thus, we find the use of “chacha” (fa-
ther’s younger brother), “bhaiya” (elder brother)
as well as “baapu” (father) used frequently in the
data as address forms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99823">
3.2 English words in Hindi matrix
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999889">
There is a far greater use of English words in
Hindi matrices both as single words as well as
multi-word expressions. A total of 116 unique
Hindi words are found embedded in En matrices
of which 76 are single word embedding and the
rest are a part of 16 multi-word expressions.
While Nouns continue to dominate the POS class
of the Hindi embedding as well, there is far more
variations in the type of CM that seems to be hap-
pening in this case.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.900646">
3.2.1 Single Word Embedding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999938666666667">
As in the case of English embedding (3.1) we find
a number of Hindi Noun embedding to be of kin-
ship terms, greetings and other address form.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.976738">
120
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997253488888889">
Words like, “sir”, “uncle”, “hello”, “good morn-
ing” etc are used frequently to start or end a par-
ticular turn.
A fraction of Nouns are genuine borrowings into
the language is no Hindi equivalent for that
word/concept. Common examples are words like
“goal” and “bomb” which may be considered a
part of the Hindi vocabulary. What is interesting
is that users’ variations in spellings these words
either in English (“goal”, “bomb”) or in equiva-
lent Hindi transliteration (“gol”, “bam”). This
may be taken as an indication that the user is not
actively conscious of using an English word.
However, there are a fairly large number of Nouns
as single words where this is not applicable as in:
“agar aap BJP ke follower hain to is page ko like
karen”
(If you are a BJP follower then like this page)
where there are frequently used Hindi equivalents
but the user seems to be following certain conven-
tions on Facebook (“page” and “like”) or is mix-
ing for other purposes (“follower”)
Single adjectives are not as common and when
used are mostly intensifiers such as “very” or
“best” etc. There are some instances of adjectives
as nonce-borrowings such as in the following ex-
ample:
“...divine paramparaa ko aage...”
(...(taking the) divine tradition forward...)
Single verb embedding of En words are always of
the form V + kar in the data. The verb karnaa (“to
do”) in Hindi is used to form conjunctives in
Hindi. Thus, we have a number of Hindi phrases
of the type: kaam karnaa “ work to do” (to work),
and a closer look at the English Verbs embedded
in Hindi shows that most of these are actually in
their nominalized form, such as “ driving kar-
naa”, or as a V + V conjunct such as “admit kar-
naa”.
There are fewer instances of other POS classes,
however, one interesting case is the use of con-
juncts like “but” and “and” to join two Hindi
clauses as in:
“main to gayi thi but wo wahaan nahi thaa”
(I had gone but he wasn’t there)
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.781502">
3.2.2 Multi Word Embedding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999165">
Multi word expressions in English used in a Hindi
matrix range from standard formulaic expressions
to clause or phrase insertion. Other than standard
greetings, these formulaic (or frozen) expression
may work as Named Entities or Nominal com-
pounds as in the case of “Film star”, “Cricket
player”, “Health minister”, “Educational Insti-
tutes” and “Participation Certificate”. There are
also other expressions that border on formulaic in
English but which nevertheless have an ambigu-
ous status within Hindi, such as, “love and affec-
tion”. Another example of such a case of MW em-
bedding is:
“Befitting reply to mere papa ne maaraa”
(my father gave a befitting reply)
Here, while “befitting reply” is not really a formu-
laic expression in Hindi, the user is clearly using
it as such with the use of the emphatic to and the
use of the verb maaraa (“hit”) instead of diyaa
(“gave”)
Clause or phrase level mixing, though less fre-
quent can also be found in the data. For example,
“Those who support the opposition kabhi Mu-
zaffarnagar aa kar dekho”
(Those who support the opposition should come
to Muzaffarnagar and see (for themselves))
This is a classic case of CM where both the
phrases retain the grammatical structure of the
language concerned.
As can be seen from the analysis of the annotated
corpus above, Code-Mixing if understood as the
insertion of words from a language into the gram-
matical structure of another, can show a wide var-
iation in its structural linguistic manifestation.

In linguistic literature on “other language embed-
ding” there has been a long-standing debate on
what is true Code-mixing, what is nonce-word
borrowing, and what are “loanwords” that
are integrated into the native vocabulary and
grammatical structure (Bentahila and Davies,
1991, Field 2002, Myers-Scotton 2002, Winford
2003, Poplack and Dion 2012). Many linguists be-
lieve that loan-words start out as a CM or Nonce-

borrowing but by repeated use and diffusion
across the language they gradually convert to na-
tive vocabulary and acquire the characteristics of
the “borrowing” language (see Alex (2008) for a
discussion). Normally, they look at spoken forms
to see phonological convergence and inflections
for morpho-syntactic convergence. However, as
pointed out by Poplack and Dion (2012) the prob-
lem with this is that in many cases a native “ac-
cent” might be mistaken for phonological conver-
gence, and a morpho-syntactic marking might not
be readily visible. For example, most Hindi speak-
ers of English would pronounce an English alve-
olar /d/ as a retroflex because an alveolar plosive
is not a part of the Hindi phonology. However,
this does not imply that the said English word has
become a part of the native vocabulary. Similarly,
if we look at the two sentences:
“sab artists ko bulayaa hai”
(all artists have been called),
and
“sab artist kal aayenge”
(all artists will come tomorrow)
In the first sentence the English inflection –s on
the word artist marks it as plural but in the second
case, the plural is marked on the Hindi Verb. Does
this imply that in the first case it is CM and in the
second a case of borrowing given that both the
forms and the structures are equally acceptable
and common in Hindi?
Many studies (Mysken 2000, Gardner-Chloros.
2009, Poplack and Dion 2012 etc.) thus point out
that it is not easy to decide these categories espe-
cially for single words without looking at dia-
chronic data and the inherent fuzziness of the dis-
tinction itself. In general, it is believed that there
exists a sort of continuum between CM and loan
vocabulary where the edges might be clearly dis-
tinguishable but it is difficult to disambiguate the
vast majority in the middle especially for single
words.
As we have seen in the preceding Section CM of
Hin in English matrix mainly follows a very dis-
tinct pattern of using NEs (and functional NEs)
and formulaic expressions. However, in the case
of En in Hindi CM, there is a far wider variation
and it could be difficult in many instances to de-
cide by just looking at the data whether a certain
embedding is a borrowing or CM.
One way to make a distinction between a borrow-
ing and CM could be to look at the diffusion of the
word in the native language. Borrowed words of-
ten appear in monolingual usage long before dic-
tionaries and lexicons adopt them as native vocab-
ulary. Thus, to judge the diffusion of an English
word one would have to look at the frequency of
its use in suitable monolingual context such as
news wire data, chat logs or telephone conversa-
tions.
For a further analysis of En embedding in Hin
matrix in our data, we decided to check their fre-
quency based diffusion in a monolingual new cor-
pus of Hindi. For this purpose we took a corpus of
51,277,891words from Dainik Jagaran
(http://www.jagran.com/), a popular daily news-
paper in Hindi, and created a frequency count of
the 230,116 unique words in it. News corpora are
a reasonable choice for monolingual frequencies
as code-mixing is relatively rare and frowned
upon in news unless it refers to a named entity or
is a part of a direct quote. We then mapped com-
mon Hindi equivalents of all the English words
used in the corpora. Finally, we checked the fre-
quency of both the English embedding as well as
their corresponding Hindi equivalents. As men-
tioned before, a number of English words do not
have Hindi equivalents and for these words we ex-
pect the English words themselves to have a high
frequency count in the corpus.
An analysis of the results thus obtained shows
that the English words do indeed fall into two dis-
tinct buckets at the edges. Thus, for words such as
“party” (as in “political party”), “vote”, “team”
we find that not only are the word counts quite
high (over 67K for “party” and over 18k for
“vote” and “team”) but the counts for the equiva-
lent Hindi forms are relatively low. Similarly,
words like “affection”, “driving”, “easily” etc.
were not found in the corpus, while their Hindi
equivalents had relatively medium to high counts.
However, there is a large number of words in the
middle where both the English and the Hindi
equivalents have a comparative count or the dif-
ference is not significant. For these words it is dif-
ficult to decide whether they ought to be classified
as borrowing or CM.
Let us denote the frequency of an En word as fe
and that of its Hin synonym as fh. Let S be an ar-
bitrary margin &gt; 0. The aforementioned intuition
about the nature of CM and borrowing can be for-
malized as follows:
 If for a given word log(fh/fe)&gt; S, we call it
CM
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989866">
122
</page>
<listItem confidence="0.9890092">
• If for a given word log(fh/fe) &lt; -δ, we call
it a borrowing.
• If -δ &lt;_ log(fh/fe) &lt;_ δ, it is not possible to
decide between the two cases, and hence
we call the word ambiguous.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999351322580645">
Figure 1 shows the scatter plot of the frequency of
all the En words that occur within Hin matrix (119
in total) in the Dainik Jagaran data (x-axis) against
the frequency of its Hindi synonym (y-axis) in the
same corpus. Since frequency follows Zipfs law,
the axes are in log-scale. The words, which are
represented by dots in Figure 1, are scattered all
over the plot without any discernable pattern. This
indicates that there are no distinct classes of words
that can be called borrowings or mixing; rather, it
is a continuum. If we assume δ to be 1, an arbi-
trary value, we can divide the plot into three zones
using the three rules proposed above. These
zones, bounded by the blue lines are shown in Fig-
ure 1: Mixing – words that are code-mixed (top-
left triangle), borrowings (bottom-right triangle)
and ambiguous (the narrow zone running diago-
nally between the two with a width of 2δ.
However, we observe that some En words which
has very high frequency in our corpus (e.g., vote,
party, team), are classified as ambiguous because
their Hin synonyms have a comparable high fre-
quency as well. To a native speaker of Hindi,
these words are clearly borrowings and used even
in formal Hin text. In fact, it seems reasonable to
declare an En word as a borrowing solely on the
basis of its very high frequency in the monolin-
gual corpus. We could choose another arbitrary
threshold α = 1000, such that a word is declared
as a borrowing if the following two conditions are
satisfied:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999824">
• -δ &lt;_ log(fh/fe) &lt;_ δ
• fe &gt; α
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995592">
Note that the choice of α should also depend on
the size of the corpus. Table 6 reports the number
of CM in the data with and without applying the
large frequency rule. We see that the number of
CM words is the highest followed by ambiguous
words. This clearly indicates that CM is a very
common phenomenon on social media. Appendix
A lists all the En words and their classes.
Using arbitrary thresholds, δ and α, to classify the
words into three distinct set is a convenient tool to
deal with code-mixing; but it ignores the fact that
in reality it is not possible to classify words into a
few distinct categories. There is always a contin-
uum between borrowing and mixing. Figure 1
shows a more appropriate gradient based visuali-
zation of the space. Words falling on the darker
regions of this plot are more likely to be borrow-
ing. The gradients reflect the two equations dis-
cussed above. The darkness linearly increases
with log(fe) and decreases with log(fh/fe). The
overall darkness is a simple linear combination of
these two independent factors. Note that this for-
mulation is only for a visualization purpose, and
should not be interpreted as some formal proba-
bility or measure of “borrowing-ness” of a word.

into three classes for δ =1.
A note on synonym selection: Which syno-
nym(s) of an En word should be considered for
CM vs. borrowing analysis is a difficult question.
First, a word can have many senses. E.g., the word
party can mean a political party, a group of peo-
ple, or a social gathering, and also a verb – to par-
ticipate in a social gathering. Each of these senses
can be translated in, often more than one ways.
E.g., dala in the sense of political party,
anusThANa or dAwata in the sense of social gath-
ering, etc. To complicate the situation further,
these Hindi words can have many senses as well
(e.g., the word dala can mean a sports team, or a
political party or group of people or animals).
Thus, when we compare synonyms without
context, we cannot be sure in which sense the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996507">
123
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845315789474">
words are used and therefore, the frequency
counts maybe misleading. A second problem arise
with phrase embedding. While an entire phrase
can be borrowed, its words may not be (e.g., clean
chit -Indian version of the English expression
“clean sheet”- is a borrowed expression in Hindi,
but clean is not). However, we had access to only
the wordlist and word frequencies, which made it
impossible to disentangle such effects. Compar-
ing contexts automatically deciphering word
sense is a complex problem in itself. For this
work, we used an En to Hin lexicon
(http://shabdkosh.raftaar.in/) to find out the syno-
nyms, and for every synonym extracted the fre-
quency from the wordlist, and deemed the highest
frequency as the fh for the word. A more thorough
synonym selection using context and phrase level
analysis would be an interesting extension of this
work.

4.1 Ambiguous Words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987279069767">
The words classified as ambiguous pose a prob-
lem as we do not know whether these words are
in the process of being borrowed, or are working
as near-synonym of the Hindi equivalent, or are
CMs where the intention of the user is the motiva-
tion for the “other language” use.
Poplack and Dion (2012) are of the view that there
does not exist a continuum between CM, Nonce-
borrowing and loanwords. In their diachronic
study on En-French CM, the authors show that the
frequency of all three categories remain stable.
According to them, a user is always aware
whether they are using an “other language” word
as a CM (for socio-linguistic purposes) or as a so-
cio-linguistically unmarked borrowing. Our data
does not capture diachronic statistics neither does
our monolingual corpus is at the scale at which
language changes occur. However, we interpret
our results to indicate that there is indeed a fuzzy
boundary between CM and borrowing. Neverthe-
less, this distinction may not be readily observable
through word classification or even diffusion
and/or other structural linguistic features. The no-
tion of “social acceptance” of a particular word in
that language community may play a big role.
Further, the perception of a word as either CM,
or borrowing could depend on a large number of
meta- and extra-linguistic factors that may include
including the fluency of the user in English, famil-
iarity with the word, and the pragmatic/dis-
course/socio-linguistics reasons for using them.
Thus, for a true bilingual, fluent in both lan-
guages, an adverb like “easily” might be more sta-
ble and almost a borrowing, but for someone with
less familiarity with English, it might be a mixing.
Similarly, whether or not a person is consciously
using the English word to make a point can matter.
A frequent example of this in our data is the use
of swear words and expletives which are often ac-
companied by a switch in language. These words
thus are difficult to disambiguate without more in-
formation and data, and an analysis that takes into
account the non-structural linguistic motivations.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974675">
In this paper, we present an analysis of data from
Facebook generated by En-Hin bilingual users.
Our analysis shows that a significant amount of
this data shows Code Mixing in the form of En in
Hindi matrix as well as Hin in English matrix.
While the embedding of Hindi words in English
mostly follows formulaic patterns of Nouns and
Particles, the mixing of English in Hindi is clearly
happening at different levels, and is of different
types. This can range from single words to multi-
word phrases ranging from frozen expressions to
clauses. Considering monolingual corpus fre-
quency counts clearly shows that the words them-
selves fall into three categories of clear CM, clear
Borrowings and Ambiguous where the distinction
becomes fuzzy. The problem is amplified because
in transliterated text, even the borrowings are
mostly in English spellings and sometimes Hindi
spellings (goal vs gol), and will be identified as
English words. From an NLP perspective, all
these have to be handled differently. Some are
easier to handle (“party” would be in a Hindi lex-
icon, for example, and NEs) and some are more
difficult for example where Adverbials or clauses
are involved.
The insights from this analysis indicate that any
future work on CM in social media content would
have to involve a deeper analysis at the intersec-
tion of structural and discourse linguistics. We
plan to continue our work in this area in the future
with focus on larger data sets, richer annotations
which take into account not only structural lin-
guistics annotation but also discourse and prag-
matic level annotations. We believe that an under-
standing of the interaction between morpho-syn-
tax and discourse, and a deeper look at sociolin-
guistic context of the interaction in the future will
help us to better define and understand this phe-
nomenon and hence, implement suitable NLP
techniques for processing such data.

The main view held by linguists being that a lexical item goes from being used as a foreign word to a valid loanword indistinguishable from the native vocabulary by virtue of repeated use and adoption of morpho-syntactic features of the recipient language (Auer 1984). However, in the case of single words, most scholars agree that it is difficult to determine whether or not a word is a “bona fide loanword/borrowing” or an instance of nonce borrowing2 or CM (Alex 2008, Bentahila and Davies, 1991, Field 2002, Myers-Scotton 2002, Winford 2003). In this study, we only consider Code-mixing examples, i.e., intra-sentential embedding of a language in another language. Processing such language data is challenging from the perspective of linguistic understanding vis-à-vis discourse and conversational analysis, as well as computational modelling and applications to Machine Translation, Information Retrieval and Natural Interfaces.

However, this can be a possible occurrence in En-Hin CM and needs to be marked as such. Normalization: Whenever a word in its native script uses a non-standard spelling (including contractions) it is marked with its correct spellings. For transliterations of Hindi in Roman script, the word is marked with the correct spelling in Devanagari script. POS tagging: Each word is labelled with its POS tag following the Universal Tagset proposed by Petrov et al (2011). This tagset uses 12 high-level tags for main POS classes. While, this tagset is not good at capturing granularity at a deeper level, we chose this because of a) its applicability to both English and Hindi doing away with the need for any mapping of labels between the two languages, and b) the small size of the corpus posed serious doubts on the usefulness of a more granular tagset for any analysis. The POS tags were decided on the basis of the function of the word in a context rather than a decontextualized absolute word class.

Further, it is often difficult to disambiguate a borrowing as a valid native vocabulary from a mixing of a second language when dealing with single words. An understanding of the nature of mixing in such data is one of the first steps towards processing this data and hence, making a more natural interaction in CMC a real possibility. 2 1once-borrowings are typically borrowings that do not necessarily follow any phonological, morpho-syntactic or sociolinguistic constraints on their assimilation into the host language (Poplack et al 1988). However, it is not clear if this is always a defining feature In this paper, we analyze social media content from English-Hindi (En-Hin) bilingual users to better understand CM in such data. We look at the extent of CM in both Hindi embedding in English, as well as English in Hindi. Our analysis of the type of CM in this context based on frequency of use and linguistic typology helps further an understanding of the different kinds of CM employed by users and emphasizes the need to tackle these at different levels.

Does this imply that in the first case it is CM and in the second a case of borrowing given that both the forms and the structures are equally acceptable and common in Hindi? Many studies (Mysken 2000, Gardner-Chloros. 2009, Poplack and Dion 2012 etc.) thus point out that it is not easy to decide these categories especially for single words without looking at diachronic data and the inherent fuzziness of the distinction itself. In general, it is believed that there exists a sort of continuum between CM and loan vocabulary where the edges might be clearly distinguishable but it is difficult to disambiguate the vast majority in the middle especially for single words. As we have seen in the preceding Section CM of Hin in English matrix mainly follows a very distinct pattern of using NEs (and functional NEs) and formulaic expressions. How</context>

A more thorough synonym selection using context and phrase level analysis would be an interesting extension of this work. 4.1 Ambiguous Words The words classified as ambiguous pose a problem as we do not know whether these words are in the process of being borrowed, or are working as near-synonym of the Hindi equivalent, or are CMs where the intention of the user is the motivation for the “other language” use. Poplack and Dion (2012) are of the view that there does not exist a continuum between CM, Nonceborrowing and loanwords. In their diachronic study on En-French CM, the authors show that the frequency of all three categories remain stable. According to them, a user is always aware whether they are using an “other language” word as a CM (for socio-linguistic purposes) or as a socio-linguistically unmarked borrowing. Our data does not capture diachronic statistics neither does our monolingual corpus is at the scale at which language changes occur. However, we interpret our results to indicate that there is indeed a fuzz</context>

A total of 40 posts from Oct 22- 28, 2013 were manually collected and preference was given to posts having a long (50+) thread of comments. This is because CM and non-standard use of language is more frequent in comments. In the rest of the paper, we shall use the term posts to cover both comments and posts. The data was semi-automatically cleaned and formatted, removing user names for privacy. The names of public figures in the posts were retained. The final corpus consisted of 6983 between established loanwords and nonce-borrowing, the line between them being extremely tenuous (Sankoff et al, 1990) 117 posts and 113,578 words. Table 1 shows the data source statistics. While a number of posts were in the Devanagari script, the largest representation was that of Roman script.

Thus, Code-Switching is usually inter-sentences while Code-Mixing (CM) is an intra-sentential phenomenon. Linguists believe that there exists a continuum in the manner in which a lexical item transfers from one to another of two languages in contact (Myers-Scotton 2002, Thomason 2003).

The main view held by linguists being that a lexical item goes from being used as a foreign word to a valid loanword indistinguishable from the native vocabulary by virtue of repeated use and adoption of morpho-syntactic features of the recipient language (Auer 1984). However, in the case of single words, most scholars agree that it is difficult to determine whether or not a word is a “bona fide loanword/borrowing” or an instance of nonce borrowing2 or CM (Alex 2008, Bentahila and Davies, 1991, Field 2002, Myers-Scotton 2002, Winford 2003). In this study, we only consider Code-mixing examples, i.e., intra-sentential embedding of a language in another language. Processing such language data is challenging from the perspective of linguistic understanding vis-à-vis discourse and conversational analysis, as well as computational modelling and applications to Machine Translation, Information Retrieval and Natural Interfaces.

As can be seen from the analysis of the annotated corpus above, Code-Mixing if understood as the insertion of words from a language into the grammatical structure of another, can show a wide variation in its structural linguistic manifestation. 4 Borrowing ya Mixing? In linguistic literature on “other language embedding” there has been a long-standing debate on what is true Code-mixing, what is nonce-word borrowing, and what are “loanwords” that are integrated into the native vocabulary and grammatical structure (Bentahila and Davies, 1991, Field 2002, Myers-Scotton 2002, Winford 2003, Poplack and Dion 2012). Many linguists believe that loan-words start out as a CM or Nonce121 borrowing but by repeated use and diffusion across the language they gradually convert to native vocabulary and acquire the characteristics of the “borrowing” language (see Alex (2008) for a discussion). Normally, they look at spoken forms to see phonological convergence and inflections for morpho-syntactic convergence. However, as pointed out by Poplack and Dion (2012) the problem with this is that in many cases a native “accent” might be mistaken for phonological convergence, and a morpho-syntactic</context>

This paper presents preliminary results in
building an annotated corpus of the
Palestinian Arabic dialect. The corpus
consists of about 43K words, stemming
from diverse resources. The paper
discusses some linguistic facts about the
Palestinian dialect, compared with the
Modern Standard Arabic, especially in
terms of morphological, orthographic,
and lexical variations, and suggests some
directions to resolve the challenges these
differences pose to the annotation goal.
Furthermore, we present two pilot
studies that investigate whether existing
tools for processing Modern Standard
Arabic and Egyptian Arabic can be used
to speed up the annotation process of our
Palestinian Arabic corpus.

1. Introduction and Motivation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999881212121212">
This paper presents preliminary results towards
building a high-coverage well-annotated corpus
of the Palestinian Arabic dialect (henceforth
PAL), which is part of an ongoing project called
Curras. Building such a PAL corpus is a first
important step towards developing natural
language processing (NLP) applications, for
searching, retrieving, machine-translating, spell-
checking PAL text, etc. The importance of
processing and understanding such text is
increasing due to the exponential growth of
socially generated dialectal content at recent
Social Media and Web 2.0 breakthroughs.
Most Arabic NLP tools and resources were
developed to serve Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA), which is the official written language in
the Arab World. Using such tools to understand
and process Arabic dialects (DAs) is a
challenging task because of the phonological and
morphological differences between DAs and
MSA. In addition, there is no standard
orthography for DAs. Moreover, DAs have
limited standardized written resources, since
most of the written dialectal content is the result
of ad hoc and unstructured social conversations
or commentary, in comparison to MSA’s vast
body of literary works.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows:
We present important linguistic background in
Section 2, followed by a survey of related work
in Section 3. We then present the process of
collecting the Curras Corpus (Section 4) and the
challenges of annotating it (Section 5).

The Arabic language is a collection of variants
among which a standard variety (MSA) has a
special status, while the rest are considered
colloquial dialects (Bateson, 1967, Holes, 2004;
Habash, 2010). MSA is the official written
language of government, media and education in
the Arab World, but it is not anyone’s native
language; the spoken dialects vary widely across
the Arab World and are the true native varieties

of Arabic, yet they have no standard orthography
and are not taught in schools (Habash et al.,
2012, Zribi et al., 2014).
PAL is the dialect spoken by Arabic speakers
who live in or originate from the area of
Historical Palestine. PAL is part of the South
Levantine Arabic dialect subgroup (of which
Jordanian Arabic is another dialect). PAL is
historically the result of interaction between
Syriac and Arabic and has been influenced by
many other regional language such as Turkish,
Persian, English and most recently Hebrew. The
Palestinian refugee problem has led to additional
mixing among different PAL sub-dialects as well
as borrowing from other Arabic dialects. We
discuss next some of the important
distinguishing features of PAL in comparison to
MSA as well as other Arabic dialects. We
consider the following dimensions: phonology,
morphology, and lexicon. Like other Arabic
dialects, PAL has no standard orthography.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.970177">
2.2 Phonology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999108684931507">
PAL consists of several sub-dialects that
generally vary in terms of phonology and
lexicon preferences. Commonly identified sub-
dialects include urban (which itself varies mostly
phonologically among the major cities such as
Jerusalem, Jaffa, Gaza, Nazareth, Nablus and
Hebron), rural, and Bedouin. The Druze
community has also some distinctive
phonological features that set it apart. The
variations are a miniature version of the
variations in Levantine Arabic in general.
Perhaps the most salient variation is the
pronunciation of the /q/ phoneme (corresponding
to MSA قﻕ q1), which realizes as /’/ in most urban
dialects, /k/ in rural dialects, and /g/ in Bedouin
1Arabic orthographic transliterations are provided in the
Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter (HSB) scheme (Habash et al.,
2007), except where indicated. HSB extends Buckwalter’s
transliteration scheme (Buckwalter, 2004) to increase its
readability while maintaining the 1-to-1 correspondence
with Arabic orthography as represented in standard
encodings of Arabic, i.e., Unicode, etc. The following are
the only differences from Buckwalter’s scheme (indicated
in parentheses): A آﺁ (|), å أﺃ (&gt;), w ؤﺅ (&amp;), A إﺇ (&lt;), y ئﺉ (}), h ةﺓ
(p), 0 ثﺙ (v), lb ذﺫ (*), S شﺵ ($), D ظﻅ (Z), S عﻉ (E), r غﻍ (g), ý ىﻯ
(Y), ‹ ـً (F), it ـٌ (N), T ـٍ (K). Orthographic transliterations are
presented in italics. For phonological transcriptions, we
follow the common practice of using ‘/.../’ to represent
phonological sequences and we use HSB choices with some
extensions instead of the International Phonetic Alphabet
(IPA) to minimize the number of representations used, as
was done by Habash (2010).
dialects. The Druze dialect retains the /q/
pronunciation. Another example is the /k/
phoneme (corresponding to MSA كﻙ k), which
realizes as /ts/ in rural dialects. These difference
cause the word for ﺐﻠﻗ qlb ‘heart’ to be
pronounced as /qalb/, /’alb/, /kalb/ and /galb/ and
to be ambiguous out of context with the word ﺐﻠﻛ
klb ‘dog’ /kalb/ and /tsalb/. And similarly to
EGY (but unlike Tunisian Arabic), the MSA
phoneme /0/ (ثﺙ θ) becomes /s/ or /t/, and the
MSA phoneme /lb/ (ذﺫ ð) becomes /z/ or /d/ in
different lexical contexts, e.g., MSA بﺏﺬﻛ kðb
/kalbib/ ‘lying’ is pronounced /kizib/ in PAL and
/kidb/ in EGY.
Similar to many other dialects, e.g. EGY and
Tunisian (Habash et al., 2012; Zribi et al., 2014),
the glottal stop phoneme that appears in many
MSA words has disappeared in PAL: compare
MSA سﺱأﺃرﺭ rås /ra’s/ ‘head’ and ﺮﺌﺑ bŷr /bi’r/
‘well’ with their Palestinian urban versions: /ras/
and /bir/. Also, the MSA diphthongs /ay/ and
/aw/ generally become /e/ and /o/; this
transformation happens in EGY but not in other
Levantine dialects such as Lebanese, e.g., MSA
ﺖﯿﻴﺑ byt /bayt/ ‘house’ becomes PAL /bet/.
PAL also elides many short vowels that appear
in the MSA cognates leading to heavier syllabic
structure, e.g. MSA لﻝﺎﺒﺟ /jibal/ ‘mountains’ (and
EGY /gibal/) becomes PAL /jbal/. Additionally
long vowels in unstressed positions in some PAL
sub-dialects shorten, a phenomenon shared with
EGY but not MSA: e.g., compare /zaru/ (اﺍ وﻭرﺭاﺍزﺯ
zAr+uwA) ‘they visited’ with /zaru/ (هﻩوﻭرﺭاﺍزﺯ
zAr+uw+h) ‘they visited him’. Finally, PAL has
commonly inserted epenthetic vowels
(Herzallah, 1990), which are optional in some
cases leading to multiple pronunciations of the
same word, e.g., /kalb/ and /kalib/ (ﺐﻠﻛ klb
‘dog’). This multiplicity is not shared with MSA,
which has a simpler syllabic structure and more
limited epenthesis than PAL.

2.3 Morphology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999635">
PAL, like MSA and its dialects and other
Semitic languages, makes extensive use of
templatic morphology in addition to a large set
of affixations and clitics. There are however
some important differences between MSA and
PAL in terms of morphology. First, like many
other dialects, PAL lost nominal case and verbal
mood, which remain in MSA. Additionally, PAL
in most of its sub-dialects collapses the feminine
and masculine plurals and duals in verbs and
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999733">
most nouns. Some specific inflections are
ambiguous in PAL but not MSA, e.g., ﺖﯿﻴﺒﺣ Hbyt
/Habbet/ ‘I (or you [m.s.]) loved’.
Second, some specific morphemes are slightly or
quite different in PAL from their MSA forms,
e.g., the future marker is /sa/ in MSA but /Ha/ or
/raH/ in PAL. Another prominent example is the
feminine singular suffix morpheme (Ta
Marbuta), which in MSA is pronounced as /at/
except at utterance final positions (where it is
/a/). In some PAL urban sub dialects, it has
multiple allomorphs that are phonologically and
syntactically conditioned: /a/ (after non-front and
emphatic consonants), /e/ (after front non-
emphatic consonants), /it/ (nouns in construct
state such as before possessive pronouns) and /a/
(in deverbals before direct objects): e.g. ﺔﻄﺑ bTħ
/baTT+a/ ‘duck’, ﺔﺒﺣ Hbħ /Habb+e/ ‘pill’, ﺎﻨﺘﻄﺑ
bTnA /baTT+it+na/ ‘our duck’ and /mdars+a
+hum/ ‘she taught them’.
Third, PAL has many clitics that do not exist in
MSA, e.g., the progressive particle /b+/ (as in
/b+tuktub/ ‘she writes’), the demonstrative
particle /ha+/ (as in /ha+l+bet/ ‘this house’), the
negation cirmcumclitic /ma+ +s/ (as in
/ma+katab+s/ ‘he did not write’) and the indirect
object clitic (as in /ma+katab+l+o+s/ ‘he did not
write to him’). All of these examples except for
the demonstrative particle are used in EGY.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.990084">
2.4 Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999703066666667">
The PAL lexicon is primarily Arabic with
numerous borrowings from many different
languages. MSA cognates generally appear with
some minor phonological changes as discussed
above; a few cases include more complex
changes, e.g. /biddi/ ‘I want’ is from MSA
/bi+widd+i/ ‘in my desire’ or /illi/ ‘relative
pronoun which/who/that’ which corresponds to a
set of MSA forms that inflect for gender and
number (Lyﺬﻟاﺍ Alðy, ﻲﺘﻟاﺍ Alty, etc.). Some common
PAL words are portmanteaus of MSA words,
e.g., /lag / ‘why?’ corresponds to MSA /li+’ayy+i
say’/ ‘for what thing?’. Examples of common
words that are borrowed from other languages
include the following:

3.1 Corpus Collection and Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972212765958">
There have been many contributions aiming to
develop annotated Arabic language corpora, with
the main objective of facilitating Arabic NLP
applications. Notable contributions targeting
MSA include the work of Maamouri and Cieri,
(2002), Maamouri et al. (2004), Smrz and Hajic
(2006), and Habash and Roth (2009). These
efforts developed annotation guidelines for
written MSA content producing large-scale
Arabic Treebanks.
Contributions that are specific to DA include the
development of a pilot Levantine Arabic
Treebank (LATB) of Jordanian Arabic, which
contained morphological and syntactic
annotations of about 26,000 words (Maamouri et
al., 2006). To speed up the process of creating
the LATB, Maamouri et al. (2006) adapted MSA
Treebank guidelines to DA and experimented
with extensions to the Buckwalter Arabic
Morphological Analyzers (Buckwalter, 2004).
The LATB was used in the Johns Hopkins
workshop on Parsing Arabic Dialect (Rambow et
al., 2005; Chiang et al., 2006), which
supplemented the LATB effort with an
experimental Levantine-MSA dictionary. The
LATB effort differs from the work presented
here in two respects. First, the LATB corpus
consists of conversational telephone speech
transcripts, which eliminated the orthographic
variations issues that we face in this paper.
Secondly, when the LATB was created, there
were no robust tools for morphological analysis
of any dialects; this is not the case any more. We
plan to exploit existing tools for EGY to help the
annotation effort.
Other DA contributions include the Egyptian
Colloquial Arabic Lexicon (ECAL) (Kilany, et
al., 2002), which was developed as part of the
CALLHOME Egyptian Arabic (CHE) corpus
(Gadalla, et al., 1997). In addition to YADAC
(Al-Sabbagh and Girju, 2012), which was based
on dialectal content identification and web
harvesting of blogs, micro blogs, and forums of
EGY content. Similarly, the COLABA project
(Diab et al., 2010) developed annotated dialectal
content resources for Egyptian, Iraqi, Levantine,
and Moroccan dialects, from online weblogs.

3.2 Dialectal Orthography
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988222222222">
Due to the lack of standardized orthography
guidelines for DA, along with the phonological
differences in comparison to MSA, and dialectal
variations within the dialects themselves, there
are many orthographic variations for written DA
content. Writers in DA, regardless of the context,
are often inconsistent with others and even with
themselves when it comes to the written form of
a dialect; writing with MSA driven orthography,
or writing words phonologically sometimes.
These orthography variations make it difficult
for computational models to properly identify
and reason about the words of a given dialect
(Habash et al, 2012a), hence, a conventional
form for the orthographic notations is important.
Within this scope, we can view this problem for
Levantine dialects as an extension of the work of
Habash et al. (2012a) who proposed the so-
called CODA (Conventional Orthography for
Dialectal Arabic). CODA is designed for the
purpose of developing conventional
computational models of Arabic dialects in
general. Habash et al. (2012a) provides a
detailed description of CODA guidelines as
applied to EGY. Eskander et al. (2013) identify
five goals for CODA: (i) CODA is an internally
consistent and coherent convention for writing
DA; (ii) CODA is created for computational
purposes; (iii) CODA uses the Arabic script; (iv)
CODA is intended as a unified framework for
writing all DAs; and (v) CODA aims to strike an
optimal balance between maintaining a level of
dialectal uniqueness and establishing
conventions based on MSA-DA similarities.
CODA guidelines will be extended to cover PAL
in this paper, as discussed in Section 5.3.

3.3 Dialectal Morphological Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929571428571">
Most of the work that explored morphology in
Arabic focused on MSA (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-
Kharashi, 2004; Buckwalter, 2004; Habash and
Rambow, 2005; Graff et al., 2009; Habash,
2010). The contributions for DA morphology
analysis, however, are relatively scarce and are
usually based on either extending available MSA
tools to tackle DA specificities, as in the work of
(Abo Bakr et al., 2008; Salloum and Habash,
2011), or modeling DAs directly, without relying
on existing MSA contributions (Habash and
Rambow, 2006). Due to the variations between
MSA and DAs, available MSA tools and
resources cannot be easily extended or
transferred to work properly for DA (Maamouri,
et al., 2006; Habash, et al., 2012b). Therefore, it
is important to develop annotated and
morpheme-segmented resources, along with
morphological analysis tools, that are specific
and tailored for DAs. One of the notable recent
contributions for EGY morphological analysis
was CALIMA (Habash et al., 2012b). The
CALIMA analyzer for EGY and the commonly
used SAMA analyzer for MSA (Graff et al.,
2009) are central in the functioning of the EGY
morphological tagger MADA-ARZ (Habash et
al., 2013), and its successor MADAMIRA
(Pasha et al., 2014), which supports both MSA
and EGY.
The work we present in this paper builds on the
shoulders of these previous efforts from the
development of guidelines for orthography and
morphology (in MSA and EGY) to the use of
existing tools (specifically MADAMIRA MSA
and EGY) to speed up the annotation process.

4. Corpus Collection
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999934677419355">
Written dialects in general tend to have scarce
resources in terms of written literature; written
materials usually involve informal conversations
or traditional folk literature (stories, songs, etc.).
It is therefore often difficult to find resources for
written dialectal content. In addition, resources
of dialectal content are prone to significant noise
and inconsistency because they tend to lack
standard orthographies and rely on ad hoc
transcriptions and orthographic borrowing from
the standard variety. In the case of Arabic,
unlike MSA that dominates the formal and
written content outlets, as in the press, scientific
articles, books, and historical narration, DAs are
more naturally used in traditional and informal
contexts, such as conversations in TV series,
movies, or on social media platforms, providing
socially powered commentary on different
domains and topics. And given the lack of
standard orthography, there is common mixing
of phonetic spelling and MSA-cognate-based
spelling in addition to the so-called Arabizi
spelling – writing DAs in Roman script, rather
than Arabic script (Darwish, 2014 and Al-
Badrashiny et al., 2014). Such noise imposes
many challenges regarding the collection of
high-coverage high-accuracy DA corpora. It is
therefore important to remark that although
bigger is better when it comes to corpus size, we
focus more in this first iteration of our PAL
corpus on precision and variety rather than mere

size. That is, we tried not only to manually select
and review the content of the corpus, but also to
assure that we covered a variety of topics and
contexts, localities and sub-dialects, including
the social class and gender of the speakers and
writers. This is because such aspects help us
discover new language phenomena in the dialect
as will be discussed in the next section.
Table 1 presents the resources that we manually
collected to build the PAL Curras corpus. There
are 133 social media threads (about 16k words)
from blogs (e.g., ﻲطﻁﺎﻌﻟاﺍ ﺪﯿﻴﻤﺤﻟاﺍ ﺪﺒﻋ ﺔﻧوﻭﺪﻣ
Abdelhameed Alaaty’s blog), forums (e.g.,
ﺔﻜﺒﺷ
y L., Wi jjy i The Palestinian dialogue network),
Twitter, and Facebook. The collection was done
by reading many discussion threads and
selecting the relevant ones to assure diversity
and PAL representative content. Content that is
heavily written in a mix of languages, or a mix
of other dialects was excluded. In the same way,
we also manually collected some PAL stories,
and a list of PAL terms and their meanings,
which reflect additional diversity of topics,
contexts, and social classes. About half of our
corpus comes from 41 episode scripts from the
Palestinian TV show .r+s t ubs “Watan Aa
Watar”. Each episode discusses and provides
satirical critiques regarding different topics of
relevance to the Palestinian viewers about daily
life issues. The show’s importance stems from
the fact that the actors use a variety of
Palestinian local dialects, hence enriching the
coverage of the corpus.

5. Corpus Annotation Challenges
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997709625">
This section presents our approach to
annotating the Curras corpus. We start with a
specification of our annotation goals, followed
by a discussion of our general approach. We
then discuss in more details two important
challenges that need to be addressed for
annotation of a new dialectal corpus:
orthography and morphology.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997881">
5.1 Annotation Specification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999005">
The words are annotated in context. As such, the
same word may receive different annotations in
different contexts. We define the annotation of a
word as a tuple &lt;w, wB, c, cB, l, pB, g, z&gt;
described as follow. (Examples of such
annotations are illustrated in Table 5.):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.981691">
• w: Raw (Unicode) The raw input word
defined as a string of letters delimited by
white space and punctuation. The word is
represented in Arabic script (Unicode).
• wB: Raw (Buckwalter) The same raw input
word in the commonly used Buckwalter
transliteration (Buckwalter, 2004).
• c: CODA (Unicode) The Conventional
Orthography (Habash et al., 2012) version of
the input word.
• cB: CODA (Buckwalter) The Buckwalter
transliteration of the CODA form.
• d: Lemma The lemma of the word in
Buckwalter transliteration. The lemma is the
citation form or dictionary entry that
abstracts over all inflectional morphology
(but not derivational morphology). The
lemma is fully diacritized. We follow the
definition of lemma used in BAMA
(Buckwalter, 2004) and CALIMA-ARZ
(Habash et al., 2012b).
• pB: Buckwalter POS The Buckwalter full
POS tag, which identifies all clitics and
affixes and the stem and assigns each a sub-
tag. This representation treats clitics as
separate tokens and abstracts the
orthographic rewrites they undergo when
cliticized. See the handling of the
l/PREP+Al/DET in word #6 in Table 5.
This representation is used by the LDC in
the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB)
(Maamouri et al., 2004) and tools such as
MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014). It is a
high granularity representation that allows
researchers to easily go to coarser
granularity POS (Diab 2007; Habash, 2010;
Alkuhlani et al., 2013). The Buckwalter POS
tag can be fully diacritized or undiacritized.
Given the added complexity of producing
diacritized text manually by annotators, we
opted at this stage to only use undiacritized
forms.

<page confidence="0.943796">

</page>
<listItem confidence="0.91380475">
• g: Gloss The English gloss, an informal
semantic denotation of the lemma. In Tables
3-5, we only use one English word for space
limitations.
• i: Analysis A specification of the source of
the annotation, e.g., ANNO is a human
annotator, and MADA is the MADAMIRA
system with some minor or no automatic
post-processing. In Tables 3 and 4, which
are produced automatically, the Analysis
field is replaced with a status indicating how
usable the automatic annotation is.

5.2 General Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999967071428572">
To speed up the process of annotating our
corpus, we made the following decisions. First,
and quite obviously from the previous section,
we made a conscious decision to follow on the
footsteps of previous efforts for MSA and EGY
annotation done at the Linguistic Data
Consortium and Columbia’s Arabic Modeling
group in terms of guidelines for orthography
conventionalization and morphological
annotation. This allows us to exploit existing
guidelines with only essential modification to
accommodate PAL and produce annotations that
are comparable to those done for MSA and
EGY. This, we hope, will encourage research in
dialectal adaptation techniques and will make
our annotations more familiar and thus usable by
the community.
Second, and closely related to the first point,
we exploit existing tools to speed up the
annotation process. In this paper, we specifically
use the MADAMIRA tool (Pasha et al., 2014)
for morphological analysis and disambiguation
of MSA and EGY. Our choice of using this tool
is motivated by the assumption that EGY/MSA
and PAL share many orthographic and
morphological features. This assumption was
validated by pilot experiments, presented below,
and which show most of the PAL annotations
can be generated automatically. However, a
manual step is then needed to verify every
annotation, to correct errors and fill in gaps. The
manual annotation has not been completed yet as
of the writing of this paper submission.
Finally, we made one major simplification to
the annotations to minimize the load on the
human annotator: we do not produce diacritized
morphological analyses in the Buckwalter POS
tag. The reasons for this decision are the
following: (i) full diacritization is a complex task
that most Arabic speakers do not do and thus it
requires a lot of training and precious attention
to detail; (ii) MSA and EGY produce many
morphemes and lexical items that are quite
similar to PAL except in terms of the short
vowels (compare the lemmas for word #5 in
Tables 3, 4 and 5); (iii) PAL has many cases of
multiple valid diacritizations as mentioned
above. While we think a convention should be
defined to explain the variation and model it, it is
perhaps the topic of a future effort that is more
focused on PAL phonology. We make an
exception for the lemmas and diacritize them
since lemmas are important in indicating the
core meaning of the word. In case of different
pronunciations of the lemma, we choose the
shortest.

5.3 A Conventional Orthography for PAL
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961972222222">
As explained in Section 2, PAL, like other
Arabic dialects, does not have a standard
orthography. Furthermore, there are numerous
phonological, morphological and lexical
differences between PAL and MSA that make
the use of MSA spelling as is undesirable. PAL
speakers who write in the dialect produce
spontaneous inconsistent spellings that
sometimes reflect the phonology of PAL, and
other times the word’s cognate relationship with
MSA. For example, the word for ‘heart’ (MSA
بﺏﻠﻗ qalb) has four spellings that correspond to
four sub-dialectal pronunciations: بﺏﻠﻗ qlb /qalb/,
بﺏﻟأﺃ ålb /’alb/, بﺏﻠﻛ klb /kalb/, and بﺏﻠﺟ jlb /galb/.
Similarly, the common shortening of some long
vowels (from MSA to PAL) leads to different
orthographies as in aوﻭﻧﺎﻗ qAnwn ‘law’ (MSA
/qānon/), which can also be written with a
shortened first vowel نﻥوﻭﻧﻗ qnwn /’anon/
reflecting the PAL pronunciation. PAL also has
some clitics that do not exist in MSA, which
leads to different spellings, e.g. the PAL future
particle حﺡ H /Ha/ can be written attached to or
separate from the verb that follows it. Even
when a morpheme exists in MSA and PAL, it
may have additional forms or pronunciations.
One example is the definite article morpheme لﻝاﺍ
Al /il/ which has a non-MSA/non-EGY
allomorph /li/ when attached to nominals with
initial consonant clusters. As a result, a word
like /li+blād/ ‘the homeland/countries’ can be
spelled to reflect the morphology as aﻼﺑﻟاﺍ AlblAd
or the phonology aﻼﺑﻟ lblAd, with the latter being
ambiguous with ‘for countries’ (in PAL
/la+blād/). Finally, there are words in PAL that
have no cognate in MSA and as such have no
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995711">

<bodyText confidence="0.999956714285715">
clear obvious spelling to go with, e.g., the word
/barDo/ ‘additionally’ is spontaneously written
as وﻭﺿرﺭﺑ brDw, ﮫﻪﺿرﺭﺑ brDh and ﺔﺿرﺭﺑ brDħ.
This, of course, is not a unique PAL problem.
Researchers working on NLP for EGY and
Tunisian dialects developed CODA guidelines
for them (Habash et al., 2012a; Zribi et al.,
2014). These guidelines were by design intended
to apply (or be easily extended) to all Arabic
dialects, but were only demonstrated for two.
Our challenge was to take these guidelines
(specifically the EGY version) and extend them.
There were three types of extensions. First, in
terms of phonology-orthography, we added the
letter كﻙ k to the list of root letters to be spelled in
the MSA cognate to cover the PAL rural sub-
dialects that pronounces it as /tš/. Second, in
terms of morphology, we added the non-EGY
demonstrative proclitic هﻩ h+ and the conjunction
proclitic تﺕ t+ ‘so as to’ to the list of clitics, e.g.,
تﺕﯾﻳﺑﻟﺎﮭﻬﺑ bhAlbyt ‘in this house’ and فﻑوﻭﺷﯾﻳﺗ tyšwf ‘so
that he can see’. Finally, we extended the list of
exceptional words to cover problematic PAL
words. All of the basic CODA rules for EGY
(and Tunisian) are kept the same.
Pilot Study (I): We conducted a small pilot
study in annotating the CODA for PAL words.
We considered 1,000 words from 77 tweets in
Curras. The CODA version of each word was
created in context. 15.9% of all words had a
different CODA form from the input raw word
form. 42% of these changes involve consonants
(two-fifths of the cases), vowels (one-fifth of the
cases) and the hamzated/bare forms of the letter
Alif اﺍ A. Examples of consonant change can be
seen in Table 5 (words #4 and #10). An
additional 29% word changes involve the
spelling of specific morpheme. The most
common change (over half of the time) was for
the first person imperfect verbal prefix اﺍ A when
following the progressive particle بﺏ b: بﺏﺗﻛﺑ bktb
as opposed to بﺏﺗﻛﺎﺑ bAktb. About 18% of the
changed words experience a split or a merge
(with splits happening five time more than
merges). An example of a CODA split is seen in
Table 5 (word #9). Finally, only about 8% of the
changed words were PAL specific terms; and
less than 7% involved a typo or speech effect
elongation. These results are quite encouraging
as they suggest the differences between CODA
and spontaneously written PAL are not
extensive. Further analysis is still needed of
course.
In Tables 3 and 4 (column CODA), we show the
results of using the MADAMIRA-MSA and
MADAMIRA-EGY systems on a set of ten
words, while Table 5 shows the manually
selected or corrected CODA. MADAMIRA
generates a CODA version (contextually) by
default. We expect the EGY version to be more
successful than the MSA version in producing
the CODA for PAL given the shared presence of
many morphemes in EGY and PAL. However,
when we ran the same set of words through
MADAMIRA-EGY, we encountered many
errors in words, morphemes and spelling choices
in PAL that are different from EGY, e.g., the
raw word بﺏﺣﻧﻣ mnHb ‘we love’ (CODA بﺏﺣﻧﺑ
bnHb) is analyzed as the EGY بﺏﺣﻧ ﺎﻣ mA nHb
‘we do not love’!

5.4 Morphological Annotation Process and
Challenges
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96798685">
To study the value of using an existing
morphological analyzer for MSA or EGY in
creating PAL annotations, we conducted the
following pilot study.
Pilot Study (II): We ran the words from a
randomly selected episode of the PAL TV show
“Watan Aa Watar” (460 words) through both
MADAMIRA-MSA and MADAMIRA-EGY.
We analyzed the output from both systems to
determine its usability for PAL annotations. We
consider all analyses that are correct for PAL
annotation or usable via simple post processing
(such as removing CASE endings on MSA
words) to be correct (as in word #2 in Tables 3-
5). Words that receive incorrect analyses or no
analyses require manual modifications.
The results of this experiment are summarized in
Table 2. Table 3 and 4 illustrate sample results
for ten words and Table 5 includes the manually
created results.2

morphology or typos. As expected,
MADAMIRA-MSA had 2.5 times the number of
NA cases compared to MADAMIRA-EGY.
Examples include dialectal lexical terms (word
#7) or dialectal morphology (words # 1 and #9).
The wrongly analyzed words are words that
were assigned incorrect POS tag in context. For
example, word #3 in Tables 3 and 4 is the result
of mis-analyzing the proclitic l- as the
preposition ‘for/to’ as opposed to the non-CODA
spelling of the definite article in PAL. The
analysis provided by MADAMIRA-EGY is
correct for other contexts than the one illustrated
here. Another example is word #8, which is a
Levantine specific term hardly used in EGY and
not used at all in MSA. MADAMIRA-MSA has
a higher proportion of wrongly analyzed words
than MADAMIRA-EGY.
Overall MADAMIRA-EGY produced analyses
that were either correct and ready to use for PAL
or requiring some minor modifications such as
adjusting the vowels on the lemmas (e.g., word
#5) in one of every five words.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987304347826">
We presented our preliminary results towards
building an annotated corpus of the Palestinian
Arabic dialect. The challenges and linguistic
variations of the Palestinian dialect, compared
with Modern Standard Arabic, were discussed
especially in terms of morphology, orthography,
and lexicon. We also discussed and showed the
potential, and limitations, of using existing
resources, especially MADAMIRA-EGY, to
semi-automate and speed up the annotation
process.
The paper has also pointed out several issues that
need to be considered and researched further,
especially the development of Palestinian-
specific morphological annotation and CODA
guidelines, a Palestinian lexicon, and the
extension of MADAMIRA to analyze
Palestinian text. Our corpus will be further
extended to include more text, and all lexical
annotations (i.e., Lemmas) will be linked with
existing Arabic ontology resources such as the
Arabic WordNet (Black et al., 2006). The corpus
will be publicly available for research purposes.

CODA guidelines will be extended to cover PAL in this paper, as discussed in Section 5.3. 3.3 Dialectal Morphological Annotation Most of the work that explored morphology in Arabic focused on MSA (Al-Sughaiyer and AlKharashi, 2004; Buckwalter, 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2005; Graff et al., 2009; Habash, 2010). The contributions for DA morphology analysis, however, are relatively scarce and are usually based on either extending available MSA tools to tackle DA specificities, as in the work of (Abo Bakr et al., 2008; Salloum and Habash, 2011), or modeling DAs directly, without relying on existing MSA contributions (Habash and Rambow, 2006). Due to the variations between MSA and DAs, available MSA tools and resources cannot be easily extended or transferred to work properly for DA (Maamouri, et al., 2006; Habash, et al., 2012b). Therefore, it is important to develop annotated and morpheme-segmented resources, along with morphological analysis tools, that are specific and tailored for DAs.

These efforts developed annotation guidelines for written MSA content producing large-scale Arabic Treebanks. Contributions that are specific to DA include the development of a pilot Levantine Arabic Treebank (LATB) of Jordanian Arabic, which contained morphological and syntactic annotations of about 26,000 words (Maamouri et al., 2006). To speed up the process of creating the LATB, Maamouri et al. (2006) adapted MSA Treebank guidelines to DA and experimented with extensions to the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzers (Buckwalter, 2004). The LATB was used in the Johns Hopkins workshop on Parsing Arabic Dialect (Rambow et al., 2005; Chiang et al., 2006), which supplemented the LATB effort with an experimental Levantine-MSA dictionary.

As such, the same word may receive different annotations in different contexts. We define the annotation of a word as a tuple &lt;w, wB, c, cB, l, pB, g, z&gt; described as follow. (Examples of such annotations are illustrated in Table 5.): • w: Raw (Unicode) The raw input word defined as a string of letters delimited by white space and punctuation. The word is represented in Arabic script (Unicode). • wB: Raw (Buckwalter) The same raw input word in the commonly used Buckwalter transliteration (Buckwalter, 2004). • c: CODA (Unicode) The Conventional Orthography (Habash et al., 2012) version of the input word. • cB: CODA (Buckwalter) The Buckwalter transliteration of the CODA form. • d: Lemma The lemma of the word in Buckwalter transliteration. The lemma is the citation form or dictionary entry that abstracts over all inflectional morphology (but not derivational morphology). The lemma is fully diacritized.

Related Work 3.1 Corpus Collection and Annotation There have been many contributions aiming to develop annotated Arabic language corpora, with the main objective of facilitating Arabic NLP applications. Notable contributions targeting MSA include the work of Maamouri and Cieri, (2002), Maamouri et al. (2004), Smrz and Hajic (2006), and Habash and Roth (2009). These efforts developed annotation guidelines for written MSA content producing large-scale Arabic Treebanks. Contributions that are specific to DA include the development of a pilot Levantine Arabic Treebank (LATB) of Jordanian Arabic, which contained morphological and syntactic annotations of about 26,000 words (Maamouri et al., 2006). To speed up the process of creating the LATB, Maamouri et al. (2006) adapted MSA Treebank guidelines to DA and experimented with extensions to the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzers (Buckwalter, 2004). The LATB was used in the Johns Hopkins workshop o</context>

For a discussion of differences between Levantine and Egyptian Arabic (EGY), see Omar (1976). 2.1 Arabic and its dialects The Arabic language is a collection of variants among which a standard variety (MSA) has a special status, while the rest are considered colloquial dialects (Bateson, 1967, Holes, 2004; Habash, 2010). MSA is the official written language of government, media and education in the Arab World, but it is not anyone’s native language; the spoken dialects vary widely across the Arab World and are the true native varieties 18 Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Arabic Natural Langauge Processing (ANLP), pages 18–27, October 25, 2014, Doha, Qatar. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics of Arabic, yet they have no standard orthography and are not taught in schools (Habash et al., 2012, Zribi et al., 2014).

This representation treats clitics as separate tokens and abstracts the orthographic rewrites they undergo when cliticized. See the handling of the l/PREP+Al/DET in word #6 in Table 5. This representation is used by the LDC in the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004) and tools such as MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014). It is a high granularity representation that allows researchers to easily go to coarser granularity POS (Diab 2007; Habash, 2010; Alkuhlani et al., 2013). The Buckwalter POS tag can be fully diacritized or undiacritized. Given the added complexity of producing diacritized text manually by annotators, we opted at this stage to only use undiacritized forms. 22 • g: Gloss The English gloss, an informal semantic denotation of the lemma.

Writers in DA, regardless of the context, are often inconsistent with others and even with themselves when it comes to the written form of a dialect; writing with MSA driven orthography, or writing words phonologically sometimes. These orthography variations make it difficult for computational models to properly identify and reason about the words of a given dialect (Habash et al, 2012a), hence, a conventional form for the orthographic notations is important. Within this scope, we can view this problem for Levantine dialects as an extension of the work of Habash et al. (2012a) who proposed the socalled CODA (Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic).

Therefore, it is important to develop annotated and morpheme-segmented resources, along with morphological analysis tools, that are specific and tailored for DAs. One of the notable recent contributions for EGY morphological analysis was CALIMA (Habash et al., 2012b). The CALIMA analyzer for EGY and the commonly used SAMA analyzer for MSA (Graff et al., 2009) are central in the functioning of the EGY morphological tagger MADA-ARZ (Habash et al., 2013), and its successor MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014), which supports both MSA and EGY. The work we present in this paper builds on the shoulders of these previous efforts from the development of guidelines for orthography and morphology (in MSA and EGY) to the use of existing tools (specifically MADAMIRA MSA and EGY) to speed up the annotation process. 4. Corpus Collection Written dialects in general tend to have scarce resources in terms of written literature; written materials usually involve informal conversations or traditional folk literature (stories, songs, etc.).

PAL also elides many short vowels that appear in the MSA cognates leading to heavier syllabic structure, e.g. MSA لﻝﺎﺒﺟ /jibal/ ‘mountains’ (and EGY /gibal/) becomes PAL /jbal/. Additionally long vowels in unstressed positions in some PAL sub-dialects shorten, a phenomenon shared with EGY but not MSA: e.g., compare /zaru/ (اﺍ وﻭرﺭاﺍزﺯ zAr+uwA) ‘they visited’ with /zaru/ (هﻩوﻭرﺭاﺍزﺯ zAr+uw+h) ‘they visited him’. Finally, PAL has commonly inserted epenthetic vowels (Herzallah, 1990), which are optional in some cases leading to multiple pronunciations of the same word, e.g., /kalb/ and /kalib/ (ﺐﻠﻛ klb ‘dog’). This multiplicity is not shared with MSA, which has a simpler syllabic structure and more limited epenthesis than PAL. 2.3 Morphology PAL, like MSA and its dialects and other Semitic languages, makes extensive use of templatic morphology in addition to a large set of affixations and clitics. There are however some important differences between MSA and PAL in terms of morphology. First, like many other dialects, PAL lost nominal case and verbal mood, which remain in </context>

The LATB was used in the Johns Hopkins workshop on Parsing Arabic Dialect (Rambow et al., 2005; Chiang et al., 2006), which supplemented the LATB effort with an experimental Levantine-MSA dictionary.

PAL is part of the South Levantine Arabic dialect subgroup (of which Jordanian Arabic is another dialect). PAL is historically the result of interaction between Syriac and Arabic and has been influenced by many other regional language such as Turkish, Persian, English and most recently Hebrew.

And similarly to EGY (but unlike Tunisian Arabic), the MSA phoneme /0/ (ثﺙ θ) becomes /s/ or /t/, and the MSA phoneme /lb/ (ذﺫ ð) becomes /z/ or /d/ in different lexical contexts, e.g., MSA بﺏﺬﻛ kðb /kalbib/ ‘lying’ is pronounced /kizib/ in PAL and /kidb/ in EGY. Similar to many other dialects, e.g. EGY and Tunisian (Habash et al., 2012; Zribi et al., 2014), the glottal stop phoneme that appears in many MSA words has disappeared in PAL: compare MSA سﺱأﺃرﺭ rås /ra’s/ ‘head’ and ﺮﺌﺑ bŷr /bi’r/ ‘well’ with their Palestinian urban versions: /ras/ and /bir/. Also, the MSA diphthongs /ay/ and /aw/ generally become /e/ and /o/; this transformation happens in EGY but not in other Levantine dialects such as Lebanese, e.g., MSA ﺖﯿﻴﺑ byt /bayt/ ‘house’ becomes PAL /bet/. PAL also elides many short vowels that appear in the MSA cognates leading to heavier syllabic structure, e.g. MSA لﻝﺎﺒﺟ /jibal/ ‘mountains’ (and EGY /gibal/) becomes PAL /jbal/. Additional</context>

Finally, there are words in PAL that have no cognate in MSA and as such have no 23 clear obvious spelling to go with, e.g., the word /barDo/ ‘additionally’ is spontaneously written as وﻭﺿرﺭﺑ brDw, ﮫﻪﺿرﺭﺑ brDh and ﺔﺿرﺭﺑ brDħ. This, of course, is not a unique PAL problem. Researchers working on NLP for EGY and Tunisian dialects developed CODA guidelines for them (Habash et al., 2012a; Zribi et al., 2014). These guidelines were by design intended to apply (or be easily extended) to all Arabic dialects, but were only demonstrated for two. Our challenge was to take these guidelines (specifically the EGY version) and extend them. There were three types of extensions. First, in terms of phonology-orthography, we added the letter كﻙ k to the list of root letters to be spelled in the MSA cognate to cover the PAL rural subdialects that pronounces it as /tš/. Second, in terms of morphology, we added the non-EGY demonstrative proclitic هﻩ h+ and the conjunction proclitic تﺕ t+ ‘so as to’ to the list of</context>

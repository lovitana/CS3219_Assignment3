Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99977137037037">
The papers in these proceedings were presented at the First Joint Workshop on Statistical Parsing
of Morphologically Rich Languages and Syntactic Analysis of Non-Canonical Languages (SPMRL-
SANCL 2014), held in Seattle, USA, on October 18th, 2013, in conjunction with the 25th international
Conference on Computational Linguistics (Coling 2014).
SPMRL-SANCL is endorsed by the ACL SIGPARSE interest group and provides a forum for research in
parsing morphologically-rich languages and non-canonical language, with the goal of identifying cross-
cutting issues in the annotation and parsing methodology, in the face of more flexible word order and/or
higher word-form variation, or lexical sparseness and ad-hoc structures than English newspaper text.
SPMRL has also been host to discussions on realistic and appropriate evaluation methods that can be
applied in the face of morphological and/or segmentation ambiguities; these discussions have culminated
in the first shared task for parsing morphologically-rich languages, co-located with SPMRL 2013, and
the second shared task for semi-supervised parsing of morphologically-rich languages, co-located with
SPMRL 2014. The proceedings include nine contributions to the workshop as well as one system
description from the shared task. The workshop included a keynote talk by Joakim Nivre (Uppsala).
We would like to thank all submitting authors for their contributions, the program committee for their
fine work on reviewing the submissions, the participants of the shared task for their contributions and
of course our invited speaker. For their precious help preparing the SPMRL 2014 Shared Task and
for allowing their data to be part of it, we warmly thank and the Linguistic Data Consortium, the
Knowledge Center for Processing Hebrew (MILA), the Ben Gurion University, Columbia University,
Institute of Computer Science (Polish Academy of Sciences), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
Technology, University of the Basque Country, Uppsala University, University of Stuttgart, University of
Szeged, University Paris Diderot (Paris 7), University of Marne La Vallée, and University of Tübingen.
We gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Språkbanken and the University of Gothenburg for
providing the PAROLE corpus and the help of Dr. Jungyeul Park and Prof. Key-Sun Cho for the KAIST
annotated news corpus. Finally, we would also like to thank the ACL SIGPARSE interest group for
their endorsement, for the support of INRIA’s Alpage project, and everybody who participated in the
workshop and contributed to the discussions.

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999246586206897">
Narrative information in Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) and literature articles contains a wealth of
clinical information about treatment, diagnosis,
medication and family history. This often includes
detailed phenotype information for specific
diseases, which in turn can help to identify risk
factors and thus determine the susceptibility of
different patients. Such information can help to
improve healthcare applications, including Clinical
Decision Support Systems (CDS). Clinical text
mining (TM) tools can provide efficient automated
means to extract and integrate vital information
hidden within the vast volumes of available text.
Development or adaptation of TM tools is reliant
on the availability of annotated training corpora,
although few such corpora exist for the clinical
domain. In response, we have created a new
annotated corpus (PhenoCHF), focussing on the
identification of phenotype information for a
specific clinical sub-domain, i.e., congestive heart
failure (CHF). The corpus is unique in this domain,
in its integration of information from both EHRs
(300 discharge summaries) and literature articles (5
full-text papers). The annotation scheme, whose
design was guided by a domain expert, includes
both entities and relations pertinent to CHF. Two
further domain experts performed the annotation,
resulting in high quality annotation, with
agreement rates up to 0.92 F-Score.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999801173913044">
An ever-increasing number of scientific articles
is published every year. For example, in 2012,
more than 500,000 articles were published in
MEDLINE (U.S. National Library of Medicine ,
2013). A researcher would thus need to review at
least 20 articles per day in order to keep up to
date with latest knowledge and evidence in the
literature (Perez-Rey et al., 2012).
EHRs constitute a further rich source of
information about patients’ health, representing
different aspects of care (Jensen et al., 2012).
However, clinicians at the point of care have
very limited time to review the potentially large
amount of data contained within EHRs. This
presents significant barriers to clinical
practitioners and computational applications
(Patrick et al., 2006).
TM tools can be used to extract phenotype
information from EHRs and the literature and
help researchers to identify the characteristics of
CHF and to better understand the role of the
deterioration in kidney function in the cycle of
progression of CHF.

There are many well-known publicly available
corpora of scientific biomedical literature, which
are annotated for biological entities and/or their
interactions (often referred to as events) (Roberts
et al., 2009; Xia &amp; Yetisgen-Yildiz, 2012).
Examples include GENIA (Kim et al., 2008),
BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007) GREC
(Thompson et al., 2009), PennBioIE (Kulick et
al., 2004), GENETAG (Tanabe et al., 2005) and
LLL’05 (Hakenberg et al., 2005). However, none
of these corpora is annotated with the types of
entities and relationships that are relevant to the
study of phenotype information.
On the other hand, corpora of clinical text
drawn from EHRs are rare, due to privacy and
confidentiality concerns, but also because of the
time-consuming, expensive and tedious nature of
producing high quality annotations, which are
reliant on the expertise of domain experts
(Uzuner et al., 2011). A small number of corpora,
however, have been made available, mainly in
the context of shared task challenges, which aim
to encourage the development of information
extraction (IE) systems. These corpora vary in
terms of the text type and annotation granularity.
For example, the corpus presented in (Pestian et
al., 2007) concerns only structured data from
radiology reports, while the corpus presented in
(Meystre &amp; Haug, 2006) contains unstructured
parts of EHRs, but annotated with medical
problem only at the document level.
Other corpora are more similar to ours, in that
that they include text-bound annotations

corresponding to entities or relations. CLEF
(Clinical E-Science Framework) (Roberts et al.,
2008) was one of the first such corpora to
include detailed semantic annotation. It consists
of a number of different types of clinical records,
including clinic letters, radiology and
histopathology reports, which are annotated with
a variety of clinical entities, relations between
them and co-reference. However, the corpus has
not been made publicly available. The more
recent 2013 CLEF-eHEALTH challenge
(Suominen et al., 2013) corpus consists of EHRs
annotated with named entities referring to
disorders and acronyms/abbreviations, mapped
to UMLS concept identifiers.
The Informatics for Integrating Biology at the
Bedside (i2b2) NLP series of challenges have
released a corpus of de-identified clinical records
annotated to support a number of IE challenges
with multiple levels of annotation, i.e., entities
and relations (Uzuner et al., 2008; Uzuner,
2009). The 2010 challenge included the release
of a corpus of discharge summaries and patient
reports in which named entities and relations
concerning medical problems, tests and
treatments were annotated (Uzuner et al., 2011).
A corpus of EHRs from Mayo Clinic has been
annotated with both linguistic information (part-
of–speech tags and shallow parsing results) and
named entities corresponding to disorders (Ogren
et al., 2008; Savova et al., 2010).

The discharge summaries in our PhenoCHF
corpus constitute a subset of the data released for
the second i2b2 shared task, known as
“recognising obesity” (Uzuner, 2009).
PhenoCHF corpus was created by filtering the
original i2b2 corpus, such that only those
summaries (a total of 300) for patients with CHF
and kidney failure were retained.
The second part of PhenoCHF consists of the
5 most recent full text articles (at the time of
query submission) concerning the characteristics
of CHF and renal failure, retrieved from the
PubMed Central Open Access database.

4 Methods and results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995645">
The design of the annotation schema was guided
by an analysis of the relevant discharge
summaries, in conjunction with a review of
comparable domain specific schemata and
guidelines, i.e., those from the CLEF and i2b2
shared tasks. The schema is based on a set of
requirements developed by a cardiologist. Taking
into account our chosen focus of annotating
phenotype information relating to the CHF
disease, the cardiologist was asked firstly to
determine a set of relevant entity types that relate
to CHF phenotype information and the role of
the decline in kidney function in the cycle of
CHF (exemplified in Table 1), secondly to locate
words that modify the entity (such as polarity
clues) and thirdly to identify the types of
relationships that exist between these entity types
in the description of phenotype information
(Table 2) .
Secondly, medical terms in the records are
mapped semi-automatically onto clinical
concepts in UMLS, with the aid of MetaMap
(Aronson, 2001).
The same annotation schema and guidelines
were used for both the discharge summaries and
the scientific full articles. In the latter, certain
annotations were omitted, i.e., organ entities,
polarity clues and relations. This decision was
taken due to the differing ways in which
phenotype information is expressed in discharge
summaries and scientific articles. In discharge
summaries, phenotype information is explicitly
described in the patient’s medical history,
diagnoses and test results. On the other hand,
scientific articles summarise results and research
findings. This means that certain types of
information that occur frequently in discharge
summaries are extremely rare in scientific
articles, such that their occurrences are too sparse
to be useful in training TM systems, and hence
they were not annotated.
The annotation was carried out by two medical
doctors, using the Brat Rapid Annotation Tool
(brat) (Stenetorp et al., 2012), a highly-
configurable and flexible web-based tool for
textual annotation.
Annotations in the corpus should reflect the
instructions provided in the guidelines as closely
as possible, in order to ensure that the
annotations are of ahigh quality. A standard
means of providing evidence regarding the
reliability of annotations in a corpus is to
calculate a statistic known as the inter-annotator
agreement (IAA). IAA provides assurance that
different annotators can produce the same
annotations when working independently and
separately. There are several different methods of
calculating IAA, which can be influenced by the
exact nature of the annotation task. We use the
measures of precision, recall and F-measure to

indicate the level of inter-annotator reliability
(Hripcsak &amp; Rothschild, 2005). In order to
carry out such calculations, one set of
annotations is considered as a gold standard and
the total number of correct entities is the total
number of entities annotated by this annotator.
Precision is the percentage of correct positive
predictions annotated by the second annotator,
compared to the first annotator’s assumed gold
standard. It is calculated as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.968014">
P = TP / TP + FP
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.978148666666667">
Recall is the percentage of positive cases
recognised by the second annotator. It is
calculated as follows:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.972066">
R = TP / TP + FN
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.972269">
F-score is the harmonic mean between
precision and recall.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.4679365">
F-score =
2* (Precision * Recall) / Precision + Recall
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947727272728">
We have calculated separate IAA scores for
the discharge summaries and the scientific
articles. Table 3 summarises agreement rates for
term annotation in the discharge summaries,
showing results for both individual entity types
and macro-averaged scores over all entity types.
Relaxed matching criteria were employed, such
that annotations added by the two annotators
were considered as a match if their spans
overlapped. In comparison to related efforts, the
IAA rates shown in Table 3 are high. However,
it should be noted that the number of targeted
classes and relations in our corpus is small and
focused, compared to other related corpora.
Agreement statistics for scientific articles are
shown in Table 4. Agreement is somewhat lower
than for discharge summaries, which this could
be due to the fact that the annotators (doctors)
are more used to dealing with discharge
summaries in their day-to-day work, and so are
more accustomed to locating information in this
type of text. Scientific articles are much longer
and generally include more complex language,
ideas and analyses, which may require more than
one reading to fully comprehend the information
within them. Table 5 shows the agreement rates
for relation annotation in the discharge
summaries. The agreement rates for relationships
are relatively high. This can partly be explained
by the deep domain knowledge possessed by the
annotators and partly by the fact that the
relationships to be identified were relatively
simple, linking only two pre-annotated entities.

A standard means of providing evidence regarding the reliability of annotations in a corpus is to calculate a statistic known as the inter-annotator agreement (IAA). IAA provides assurance that different annotators can produce the same annotations when working independently and separately. There are several different methods of calculating IAA, which can be influenced by the exact nature of the annotation task. We use the measures of precision, recall and F-measure to 70 indicate the level of inter-annotator reliability (Hripcsak &amp; Rothschild, 2005). In order to carry out such calculations, one set of annotations is considered as a gold standard and the total number of correct entities is the total number of entities annotated by this annotator. Precision is the percentage of correct positive predictions annotated by the second annotator, compared to the first annotator’s assumed gold standard. It is calculated as follows: P = TP / TP + FP Recall is the percentage of positive cases recognised by the second annotator. It is calculated as follows: R = TP / TP + FN F-score is the harmonic mean between precision and recall. F-score = 2* (Pre</context>

For example, in 2012, more than 500,000 articles were published in MEDLINE (U.S. National Library of Medicine , 2013). A researcher would thus need to review at least 20 articles per day in order to keep up to date with latest knowledge and evidence in the literature (Perez-Rey et al., 2012). EHRs constitute a further rich source of information about patients’ health, representing different aspects of care (Jensen et al., 2012). However, clinicians at the point of care have very limited time to review the potentially large amount of data contained within EHRs. This presents significant barriers to clinical practitioners and computational applications (Patrick et al., 2006). TM tools can be used to extract phenotype information from EHRs and the literature and help researchers to identify the characteristics of CHF and to better understand the role of the deterioration in kidney function in the cycle of progression of CHF. 2 Related work There are many well-known publicly available corpora of scientific biomedical li</context>

In discharge summaries, phenotype information is explicitly described in the patient’s medical history, diagnoses and test results. On the other hand, scientific articles summarise results and research findings. This means that certain types of information that occur frequently in discharge summaries are extremely rare in scientific articles, such that their occurrences are too sparse to be useful in training TM systems, and hence they were not annotated. The annotation was carried out by two medical doctors, using the Brat Rapid Annotation Tool (brat) (Stenetorp et al., 2012), a highlyconfigurable and flexible web-based tool for textual annotation. Annotations in the corpus should reflect the instructions provided in the guidelines as closely as possible, in order to ensure that the annotations are of ahigh quality. A standard means of providing evidence regarding the reliability of annotations in a corpus is to calculate a statistic known as the inter-annotator agreement (IAA). IAA provides assurance that different annotators can produce the same annotations when working independently and separately. There are several different methods of calculating IAA, which c</context>

CLEF (Clinical E-Science Framework) (Roberts et al., 2008) was one of the first such corpora to include detailed semantic annotation. It consists of a number of different types of clinical records, including clinic letters, radiology and histopathology reports, which are annotated with a variety of clinical entities, relations between them and co-reference. However, the corpus has not been made publicly available. The more recent 2013 CLEF-eHEALTH challenge (Suominen et al., 2013) corpus consists of EHRs annotated with named entities referring to disorders and acronyms/abbreviations, mapped to UMLS concept identifiers. The Informatics for Integrating Biology at the Bedside (i2b2) NLP series of challenges have released a corpus of de-identified clinical records annotated to support a number of IE challenges with multiple levels of annotation, i.e., entities and relations (Uzuner et al., 2008; Uzuner, 2009).

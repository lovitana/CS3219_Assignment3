<bodyText confidence="0.999749586206897">
Electronic patient records are a potentially rich
data source for knowledge extraction in bio-
medical research. Here we present a method
based on the ICD10 system for text-mining of
Danish health records. We have evaluated how
adding functionalities to a baseline text-mining
tool affected the overall performance.
The purpose of the tool was to create enriched
phenotypic profiles for each patient in a corpus
consisting of records from 5,543 patients at a
Danish psychiatric hospital, by assigning each
patient additional ICD10 codes based on free-
text parts of these records. The tool was
benchmarked by manually curating a test set
consisting of all records from 50 patients. The
tool evaluated was designed to handle spelling
and ending variations, shuffling of tokens with-
in a term, and introduction of gaps in terms. In
particular we investigated the importance of
negation identification and negation scope.
The most important functionality of the tool
was handling of spelling variation, which great-
ly increased the number of phenotypes that
could be identified in the records, without no-
ticeably decreasing the precision. Further, our
results show that different negations have dif-
ferent optimal scopes, some spanning only a
few words, while others span up to whole sen-
tences.

1. Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947063829787">
Electronic patient records (EPRs) file patient
treatment data over time and contain structured
data, such as medication information and labora-
tory test results, as well as unstructured data
contained in free text. Previously unstructured
data has been used for a range of purposes such
as diagnosis detection (e.g. Meyste, 2006; Suzu-
ki, 2008; Liao, 2010), decision support (Trem-
blay, 2009), and temporal investigation of ad-
verse drug reactions (Eriksson, to appear 2014).
Structured EPR data will primarily contain di-
agnoses relevant to the current hospitalization,
whereas free text will contain additional infor-
mation about adverse drug reactions and the
general health status of the patient. By utilizing
unstructured EPR data, it is possible to obtain a
much richer phenotypic profile of each patient,
which can be applied to the investigation of dis-
ease-disease correlations, patient stratification,
and underlying molecular level disease etiology
(Jensen, 2012).
Several tools for text mining of free text in
English medical records have been developed
previously. We present a non-English contribu-
tion to the field. We have developed a simple
parser based on the ICD10 classification system
for a Scandinavian language; Danish, which
performs well and is relatively fast to imple-
ment. The parser handles a number of variations
such as spelling and ending when matching be-
tween the corpus and the dictionary. We have
evaluated the importance of taking these varia-
tions into account in a Danish context.
An additional focus of this work was to evalu-
ate how negations should be handled in a Danish
context. It has previously been shown that it is
important to consider negations when medical
text mining and several methods such as Neg-
Scope (Agarwal, 2010), NegFinder (Mutalik,
2001) and NegEx (Chapman, 2001) have been
developed. These methods have shown good
performance, but they have all been specifically
developed for application to English text, and
can thus not be directly transferred to our pur-
pose. Instead we have here implemented a sim-
ple method for handling negations, and subse-
quently evaluated the scope of negations.

The text-mining tool presented here uses a dic-
tionary based on the Danish version of the
ICD10 system to search for mentioning of dis-
ease terminology terms in the corpus consisting
of EPRs. Five add-on functionalities for the text-
mining tool were evaluated. These were; han-
dling of A) spelling, B) ending variations, C)
allowing a gap in terms when matching, D) al-
lowing shuffling of tokens in term when match-
ing, and E) handling of negations.
The EPRs used here were 5,543 records from
the Sct. Hans Psychiatric Hospital (Roque,
2011). The free text in these records consists of
many different note types, written by a range of
different types of medical and non-medical per-
sonnel including doctors, psychiatrists, nurses
and social workers.
A test set of all records from a randomly se-
lected set of 50 patients (roughly 1% of cohort)
was manually curated. 5,765 disease related
terms (hits) were found in the test set. On aver-
age each patient was associated with a total of
115.3 hits, which covered an average of 16.96
different ICD10 codes. Each hit was traced back
to its origin in the corpus, and based on the con-
text (sentence or entire note) it was evaluated
whether the hit was correctly associated with the
patient in the text.

2.1 Generation of spelling and ending variants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955642857143">
The ICD10 terms in the dictionary are supple-
mented with synonyms comprised of spelling
and ending variants to allow a degree of fuzzy
mapping between the corpus and the dictionary.
Spelling (A) and ending (B) variants are gener-
ated by comparing all unique tokens of the cor-
pus that exceed three letters with all unique to-
kens of the dictionary. Spelling variants (A) are
generated by allowing a Damarau Levehnstein1
edit distance of one between corpus and diction-
ary tokens. Ending variations (B) are generated
by testing if a token becomes identical to a dic-
tionary term if they are both stemmed for typical
Danish endings.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999726">
2.2 Text-mining
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98143096">
A potential hit is a token or a set of tokens in a
sentence, which match a full term in the diction-
ary. When matching one gap, comprised of an

number of edits needed to turn one token into another
token. An edit can be a substitution, deletion or inser-
tion of a letter, or the reversal of a pair of letters.
interposed word, is allowed (C) in the token
string that is not found in the dictionary term.
When matching a string of tokens to a dictionary
term, shuffling of words is allowed (D), such
that the order of the words is not important.
If a potential hit is found, the preceding part of
the sentence is checked for negations (E). If a
negation is found the potential hit is discarded.
The end result is a list of hits with their match-
ing ICD10 codes.
The negations evaluated here are both true ne-
gations like “ingen” and “ikke” (“none” and
“no”), and alternative subjects such as family
members. These alternative subjects are includ-
ed as a form of negations, as a clinical term
mentioned in the same sentence as an alternative
subject, will often refer to that subject rather
than the patient covered by the record.

2.3 Evaluation of features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941545454545">
All different combinations of functionalities A-
D were tested and compared to the baseline text-
mining tool with no add-on functionalities. The
total number of hits and unique hits that a run of
the tool results in were evaluated. Total hits in-
clude all hits, whereas unique hits consider
simply how many unique 3-digit ICD10 terms
are represented.
As described above each hit generated from the
test set was evaluated to determine if it was cor-
rectly associated with the patient or not. Two
different types of precisions were calculated: I)
incidence precision, which is the number of cor-
rect hits divided by the total number of hits; II)
association precision, where a hit is counted as
correct as long as the corresponding ICD10 code
is correctly associated with the patient at least
once. Here it is assumed that as long as an
ICD10 code is correctly associated with the pa-
tient once, it does not matter if the same ICD10
code is also incorrectly associated with the pa-
tient elsewhere.

2.4 Evaluation of negations and their scope
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999806454545455">
A random sample of 500 potential hits that
were disqualified by the negation step was man-
ually curated, and it was evaluated whether it
was correct to negate the potential hits or not.
The total number of negated hits, incidence pre-
cision and the distance, in terms of number of
tokens, between the negation and the term it
negates, i.e. the scope of the negations were cal-
culated for all the negations. The same measures
were calculated for each individual negation
word occurring in the test set (data not shown).

In order to investigate the influence of the dis-
tance between the hit and the negation further,

also calculated.

3. Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993974310344827">
The incidence precision of the tool with all fea-
tures enabled was 0.867 and the association pre-
cision was slightly higher at 0.888. Enabling or
disabling of fuzzy mapping features does not
seem to affect the precision of the method. In
contrast to this, both the total number of hits and
the number of unique hits increase as more fea-
tures are enabled. This is especially true for ena-
bling feature A (spelling) and B (ending). Re-
sults for all runs can be seen in Figure 1 and
Table 1
Figure 2 shows the results from evaluation of
the negations for all 500 negated sentences.
The correlation between the precision of a nega-
tion and its distance from the hits can be seen in
Figure 2. As can be seen not all distances are
represented in the test set. It seems that inci-
dence precision is at least partly inversely relat-
ed to the distance between the candidate hit and
the negation.
Two negations are by far the most used in the
records. These are ‘ikke’ and ‘ingen’, which are
both true negations. Whereas ‘ingen’ has a very
high incidence precision at 0.946 ‘ikke’ has a
precision of only 0.573. These two negations
also have very different negation scopes as can
be seen on the plot in Figure 2 illustrating that
different negation words can have very different
scopes.

4.1 Fuzzy mapping features
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948448275862">
Quantitatively the precision of the tool present-
ed here is on par with other similar tools such as
MedLEE; 0.89 (Friedman 2004) and the tool
presented in Meystre 2006; 0.76, despite that a
relatively simple approach presented here.
Allowing ending variants (B) gives a signifi-
cant increase in total hits, but only a minor in-
crease in unique hits. This was investigated fur-
ther, and it was revealed that the term ‘ryger’
(“smoking” or “smoker”) was responsible for
this peculiarity, as the term ‘ryge’ matches
‘ryger’ when spelling variation is allowed. More
than 4/5 of the total hits generated when ena-
bling ending variation were due to this one syn-
onym generated. The same problem is apparent
when allowing spelling variants (A) as this also
allows ‘ryger’ as a synonym.
It is debatable whether it is even worth includ-
ing gap variations (D), since only very few hits
are generated. However, there seems to be a
synergistic effect between allowing gaps and
shuffling and one must keep in mind that gap
and shuffling variations only come into effect
when a hit has more than one token, and only
around 12% of all hits identified, have more
than one token. Therefore gap and shuffling var-
iations would make a bigger difference in a cor-
pus where hits with more words are more fre-
quent.

4.2 Negation evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987733333333">
The data indicates that higher distance leads to
lower precision. In order to improve the use of
negations we tested two hard precision cutoffs
(4 and 10) to limit the scope of negations. Using
these hard cutoffs increased the precision of the
negations from 0.722 to 0.921 and 0.820, re-
spectively. This is comparable to the precisions
reported for other tools such as NegEx; 0.845
(Chapman 2001) and NegFinder; 0.977/0.918
(Mutalik 2001), though one must keep in mind
that these are tested on different corpora. Setting
negation cutoffs also resulted in an increase in
number of hits identified, but did lead to slightly
lower precisions for the hits generated compared
to no cutoff (see Table 3).

4.3 Limitations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99998424">
The tool presented here was developed for
EPRs from a psychiatric hospital, which does
not guarantee its direct applicability to EPRs
from other indication areas, as these psychiatric
EPRs contain a high proportion of notes entered
by nurses and other personnel that are not medi-
cal doctors. One possible issue related to this is
that the EPRs used here do not show widespread
use of abbreviations and acronyms for disease
terms, thus a method for handling abbreviations
was not implemented. However, this might be
necessary for EPRs from other clinical domains.
Additionally the tool is limited to handle the 10
real and 24 subject negations present in the
manually constructed negation list and negations
are only allowed to negate terms in the succeed-
ing part of the sentence, which will not be true
for all negation usages.
In the approach described here it is assumed
that a disease term found in a patients journal, is
related to the given patient unless negated. This
assumption is accepted here to preserve the sim-
plicity of the approach, but is actually handled
to so some extent by including subject nega-
tions.

5. Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997230769231">
We have shown here that it is possible to make
a text-mining tool for a non-English language
that has good performance in a quick and simple
way. The full tool described here has rather
good precision and many patient-disease rela-
tions were identified that could be used to enrich
the phenotypes of the patients. Large variations
in the precision of the different negations were
found, but restricting the scopes of negations,
contributes to increasing the precision of the
negations. Furthermore, this also resulted in an
increase in the number of hits generated without
severely affecting the precision of the hits.

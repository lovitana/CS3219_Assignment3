This paper describes an experiment to
evaluate the impact of idioms on Statis-
tical Machine Translation (SMT) process
using the language pair English/Brazilian-
Portuguese. Our results show that on sen-
tences containing idioms a standard SMT
system achieves about half the BLEU
score of the same system when applied to
sentences that do not contain idioms. We
also provide a short error analysis and out-
line our planned work to overcome this
limitation.

1 Introduction and Motivation

An idiom is an expression whose meaning is not
compositional (Xatara, 2001). In other words
the meaning of an idiom is not simply the joint
meaning of the individual words (Garrao and Dias,
2001). For example, the expression kick the bucket
has an idiomatic meaning (to die) that has nothing
to do with the meaning of kick or bucket.
Idioms are a type of multi-word expressions
(MWEs) often used in a large variety of texts and
by human speakers and thus appear in all lan-
guages (Fazly et al., 2008). Consequently, they
pose problems to most Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) applications (Sag et al., 2002). Nev-
ertheless, they often have been overlooked by re-
searchers in NLP (Fazly et al., 2008).
As a class, idioms exhibit a number of prop-
erties that make them difficult to handle for NLP
applications. For example, idiomatic expressions
vary with respect to how morphosyntatically fixed
they are. An idiomatic expression is highly fixed
if the replacement of any of its constituents by a,
syntactically or semantically, similar word causes
the idiomatic meaning of the expression to be lost
(Fazly et al., 2008). An example of a highly fixed
idiom in English is the expression by and large.
Idioms that are highly fixed can be represented as
words-with-spaces by an NLP system (Sag et al.,
2002). If, however, an idiomatic meaning persists
across morphosyntactic variations of an expres-
sion, the idiom can be described as a low fixed id-
iom, for example, hold fire and its variations hold
one’s fire and held fire. The words-with-spaces ap-
proach does not work for these “more flexible” ex-
ample of idioms (Fazly et al., 2008). Another fea-
ture of idioms that make them difficult for NLP
system to process is that idiomatic expressions
have both idiomatic and literal (non-idiomatic) us-
ages. Consequently, NLP systems need to distin-
guish between these types of usages (Fazly et al.,
2008).
One of the most important NLP applications
that is negatively affected by idioms is Statistical
Machine Translation (SMT) systems. The current
state-of-the-art in SMT are phrase-based systems
(Collins et al., 2005). Phrase-based SMT systems
extend the basic SMT word-by-word approach by
splitting the translation process into 3 steps: the in-
put source sentence is segmented into “phrases” or
multi-word units; these phrases are translated into
the target language; and the translated phrases are
reordered if needed (Koehn, 2010).
It is worth highlighting that although the term
phrase-based translation seems to imply the sys-
tem works at a phrasal level, the concept of a
phrase to these systems is simply a frequently
occurring sequence of words and not necessarily
a semantic or grammatical phrase. These sys-
tems thus limit themselves to a direct translation
of phrases without any syntactic or semantic con-
text. Hence, standard phrase-based SMT systems
do not model idioms explicitly (Bouamor et al.,
2011). Unfortunately modelling idioms in order
to improve SMT is not well studied (Ren et al.,
2009) and examples of the difficulties in translat-
ing these expressions can be seen in the quality of
the resultant output of most Machine Translation

systems (Vieira and Lima, 2001).
Our long-term research goal is to investigate
how the translation of idiomatic expressions may
be improved. We will initially focus on the case
of English/Brazillian-Portugese but we intend our
work to be generalizable to other language pairs.
As a first step on this research program we wished
to scope the impact of idioms on an SMT system.
In order to test this we ran an experiment that com-
pared the BLEU scores of an SMT system when it
was tested on three distinct sentence aligned cor-
pora. Two of these test corpora consisted of sen-
tences containing idiomatic (rather than literal) us-
ages of idiomatic expressions and the other cor-
pus consisted of sentences that did not contain any
idioms. By comparing the BLEU score of a ma-
chine translation system on each of these corpora
we hoped to gauge the size of the research prob-
lem we are addressing.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the design and creation of the corpora used
in the experiments; Section 3 presents the experi-
ment’s methodology; Section 4 reports the results
found; and Section 5 both discusses the results and
describes an approach to the problem that we will
implement in future work.

The work of Fazly et al. (2008) has provided an
inspirational basis for our work. Fazly’s work fo-
cused on the study of idioms and in particular their
identification and analysis in terms of the syntactic
and semantic fixedness. Fazly study did not how-
ever explore the impact of idioms on SMT.
Some related work in translating idioms can
be found in: Garrao and Dias (2001) where the
verb+noun combinations and their inclusion in an
online automatic translator is explored; Ren et al.
(2009) which makes use of a domain constrained
bilingual multi-word dictionary to improve the
MT results; Bouamor et al. (2011) which ex-
plores a hybrid approach for extracting MWEs and
their translation in a French-English corpus; and
Bungum et al. (2013) which also uses dictionaries
to capture MWEs.
None of these works compares the BLEU score
of sentences containing and not containing idioms.
And also, none of these works address the idioms
problem for the English/Brazilian-Portuguese lan-
guage pair using SMT phrase-based systems.

The experiment we describe in this paper had two
direct targets: (a) we wished to quantify the ef-
fect of idioms on the performance of an SMT
system; and (b) we wanted to better understand
the differences (if any) between high and low
fixed idioms with respect to their impact on SMT
systems. Consequently, in order to run the ex-
periments four corpora were needed: one ini-
tial large sentence-aligned bilingual corpus was
needed to build an SMT model for the language
pair English/Brazilian-Portuguese; a test corpus
containing sentences with “highly fixed” idioms
called the “High Idiomatic Corpus”; another test
corpus containing sentences with “low fixed” id-
ioms called the “Low Idiomatic Corpus”; and a
last corpus with sentences not containing idioms
called the “Clean Corpus”. In order to make the
results comparable the length of each sentence in
the three test corpora was kept between 15 to 20
words. All of these corpora were constructed by
hand and in the cases of the “High Idiomatic Cor-
pus” and “Low Idiomatic Corpus” care was taken
to ensure that all the sentences in these corpora
contained idiomatic usages of the relevant idioms.
To create the initial large corpus a series of
small corpora available on the internet were com-
piled into one larger corpus which was used to
train a SMT system. The resources used in this
step were the Fapesp-v2 (Aziz and Specia, 2011),
the OpenSubtitles20131 corpus, the PHP Manual
Corpus2 and the KDE4 localizaton files (v.2)3. No
special tool was used to clean these corpora and
the files were compiled as is.
Idioms are a heterogeneous class; consequently,
in order to better control the experiment we de-
cided to focus on a particular type of idiom -
specifically the idiomatic expressions formed from
the combination of a verb and a noun as its di-
rect object (verb+noun combinations), for exam-
ple hit+road and lose+head. Verb+noun combi-
nations are a subclass of MWE which are notable
for their cross-lingual occurrence and high vari-
ability, both lexical and semantic (Baldwin and
Kim, 2010). Also, it is worth noting that it is possi-
ble for a particular verb+noun combination to have
both idiomatic and literal usages and these usages
must be distinguished if an NLP system is to pro-

cess a sentence appropriately.
Fazly et al. (2008) named a dataset of 17
“highly fixed” English verb+noun idioms, for ex-
ample cut+figure, and that list was used to build
our “Highly Idiomatic Corpus”. This corpus con-
sisted of 170 sentences containing idiomatic us-
ages of these idioms, 10 sentences per idiom in
the list. These English sentences were collected
from the internet and manually translated into
Brazilian-Portuguese. After that these translations
were then manually checked and corrected by a
second translator.
Fazly et al. (2008) also named a dataset of
11 “low fixed” English verb+noun idioms, for ex-
ample get+wind, and that list was used to build
our “Low Idiomatic Corpus”. This corpus con-
sisted of 110 sentences containing idiomatic us-
ages of these idioms, 10 sentences per idiom in
the list. These English sentences were also col-
lected from the internet and manually translated
into Brazilian-Portuguese. After this step these
translations were also manually checked and cor-
rected by a second translator. Table 1 presents
the English verb+noun combinations used in this
experiment and their Brazilian-Portuguese trans-
lations.
In order to have a valid comparison between the
translation results of sentences containing and not
containing idioms the “Clean Corpus” was built. It
consisted of 850 sentences with their translations
and was created by sampling sentences of the ap-
propriate length (15-20 words) that did not contain
idioms from the large bilingual corpus (that we de-
scribed earlier) which we created to train the SMT
system. These sentences were then removed from
that corpus. Because the initial corpus was cre-
ated from the union of corpora from different do-
mains the ”Clean Corpus” was randomly split into
5 datasets containing 170 sentences each in or-
der to ensure no specific influence of any of those
domains on the BLEU score. We called these
“Clean1” to “Clean5”. Special care was taken to
not have any idioms in any of the sentences in
these corpora.
As we wanted to collect 10 sentences for each
verb+noun idiomatic combination and due to the
limitations of sentence length (15 to 20 words) we
were not able to collect the “High Idiomatic Cor-
pus” and the “Low Idiomatic Corpus” from the
training corpus. Thus, the samples were collected
from the Internet.

As a first step for this experiment, a SMT
model for the English/Brazilian-Portuguese lan-
guage pair was trained using the Moses toolkit
(Koehn et al., 2007) following its “baseline” set-
tings (Koehn et al., 2008). The corpus used for this
training consisted of 17,288,109 pairs of sentences
(approximately 50% of the initial collected cor-
pus), with another 34,576 pairs of sentences used
for the “tuning” process.

standard phrase based SMT.

The corpora containing idioms achieved only
half of the average Clean Corpus score. As noted
earlier, some idioms have a direct translation from
English to Brazilian-Portuguese and could result
in straight forward translations that the basic SMT
system (without substitution) can handle correctly.
Given this, the BLEU scores for this subset of id-
ioms could be expected to be similar to the clean
corpus results. However, it is worth noting that
even for idioms that have direct translations, see
Table 1, the BLEU score for the sentences contain-
ing these idioms is still lower than average BLEU
score for the clean corpus. Using the Student’s t-
test, we found a statistical difference between the
“Low Idiomatic Corpus” and the “Clean Corpus”
(p « 0), and between the “High Idiomatic Cor-
pus” and the “Clean Corpus” (p « 0).
The second question that we examined in the
experiment was whether there was a difference in
performance between the high and low fixed id-
ioms. Table 3 lists the BLEU scores for each of
the “highly fixed” verb+noun combinations used
in the “High Idiomatic Corpus” and Table 4 lists
the BLEU scores for each of the “low fixed”
verb+noun combinations from the “Low Idiomatic
Corpus”. Also, it is important to note that the
“High Idiomatic Corpus” and the “Low Idiomatic
Corpus” have almost no difference in their BLEU
scores. We also found that there are almost no sta-
tistical difference (p = 0.85) between the “High
Idiomatic Corpus” and “Low Idiomatic Corpus”
which we believe indicates that both kinds of
verb+noun idiomatic combinations pose the same
problem to SMT.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996914">
Certainly, these results are not surprising. BLEU
scores are generally dependent on the training and
test corpora; that said, it it worthwhile having a
quantification of the potential issues that idioms
pose for SMT. Due to the fact that BLEU scores

<bodyText confidence="0.999983884057971">
are dependent on the training and test corpora used
our results are corpus specific. However, these
results are our starting point to develop a hybrid
methodology.
As noted earlier, idioms are widely used in ev-
ery literary genre and new expressions come into
existence frequently. Thus, they must be properly
handled and translated by a Machine Translation
system. Given the results of our experiments it
is evident that the problem in translating idioms
has not been solved using a standard SMT system.
Such evidences and the relatively small amount
of current related work on idiomatic expression
translation, when compared with the amount of
work on other MT aspects, indicates that there is
likely not a trivial solution.
To start addressing these problems, we propose
a hybrid method inspired by the work developed
by Okuma et al. (2008) for translating unseen
words using bilingual dictionaries.
Our method, introduced in Salton et al. (2014),
work as a pre and post-processing step. We first
identify idioms in source sentences using an id-
iom dictionary. Then, we substitute the idiom in
the source sentence with its literal meaning, taken
from the dictionary and record the fact that this
sentence contained a substituted idiom. For all
sentences that are recorded as containing a substi-
tution, after the translation we check if the orig-
inal idiom that occurred in the source sentence
has a corresponding idiom in the target language
by consulting a separate bilingual dictionary. If
there is a corresponding idiom in the target lan-
guage then the translation of the literal meaning of
the source language idiom is replaced with the tar-
get language idiom. If there are no related idioms
on the target language, this post-processing step is
avoided and the translation is done.
This approach relies on a number of dictionar-
ies being available. Developing these resources
is non-trivial and in order to scale our approach
to broad coverage a large part of our future work
will focus on automating (as much as possible)
the development of these language resources. An-
other problem that we will address in future work
is ensuring that we apply substitution appropri-
ately. There are at least two situations where care
must be taken. First, a given expression may be
used both as an idiom and literally. Consequently,
we need to develop mechanisms that will enable
our preprocessing step to distinguish between id-
iomatic and non-idiomatic usages. Second, some
idiomatic expressions have direct translations. For
these expressions we expect that the substitution
method may under-perform the standard SMT sys-
tem. Ideally, we would like to be able to control
the substitution method so that these particular ex-
pressions are allowed through the preprocessing
and are handled by the standard SMT pipeline.
However, for now, considering the proportion of
expressions with direct translations in comparison
with the overall number of expressions is very low;
we hope that this problem will not have too ad-
verse an impact on our approach. Beyond these
issues, while we anticipate that our substitution
based approached will work reasonably well for
”high fixed” idioms, we are aware that the varia-
tion in ”low fixed” idioms may require us to extend
the system in order to handle this variation.

In order to make the results comparable the length of each sentence in the three test corpora was kept between 15 to 20 words. All of these corpora were constructed by hand and in the cases of the “High Idiomatic Corpus” and “Low Idiomatic Corpus” care was taken to ensure that all the sentences in these corpora contained idiomatic usages of the relevant idioms. To create the initial large corpus a series of small corpora available on the internet were compiled into one larger corpus which was used to train a SMT system. The resources used in this step were the Fapesp-v2 (Aziz and Specia, 2011), the OpenSubtitles20131 corpus, the PHP Manual Corpus2 and the KDE4 localizaton files (v.2)3. No special tool was used to clean these corpora and the files were compiled as is. Idioms are a heterogeneous class; consequently, in order to better control the experiment we decided to focus on a particular type of idiom - specifically the idiomatic expressions formed from the combination of a verb and a noun as its direct object (verb+noun combinations), for example hit+road and lose+head.

In other words the meaning of an idiom is not simply the joint meaning of the individual words (Garrao and Dias, 2001). For example, the expression kick the bucket has an idiomatic meaning (to die) that has nothing to do with the meaning of kick or bucket. Idioms are a type of multi-word expressions (MWEs) often used in a large variety of texts and by human speakers and thus appear in all languages (Fazly et al., 2008). Consequently, they pose problems to most Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications (Sag et al., 2002). Nevertheless, they often have been overlooked by researchers in NLP (Fazly et al., 2008). As a class, idioms exhibit a number of properties that make them difficult to handle for NLP applications. For example, idiomatic expressions vary with respect to how morphosyntatically fixed they are. An idiomatic expression is highly fixed if the replacement of any of its constituents by a, syntactically or semantically, similar word causes the idiomatic meaning of the expression to be lost (Faz</context>
<context position="2722" citStr="Fazly et al., 2008" startWordPosition="437" endWordPosition="440"> NLP system (Sag et al., 2002). If, however, an idiomatic meaning persists across morphosyntactic variations of an expression, the idiom can be described as a low fixed idiom, for example, hold fire and its variations hold one’s fire and held fire. The words-with-spaces approach does not work for these “more flexible” example of idioms (Fazly et al., 2008). Another feature of idioms that make them difficult for NLP system to process is that idiomatic expressions have both idiomatic and literal (non-idiomatic) usages. Consequently, NLP systems need to distinguish between these types of usages (Fazly et al., 2008). One of the most important NLP applications that is negatively affected by idioms is Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. The current state-of-the-art in SMT are phrase-based systems (Collins et al., 2005). Phrase-based SMT systems extend the basic SMT word-by-word approach by splitting the translation process into 3 steps: the input source sentence is segmented into “phrases” or multi-word units; these phrases are translated into the target language; and the translated phrases are reordered if needed (Koehn, 2010). It is worth highlighting that although the term phrase-based transl</context>

By comparing the BLEU score of a machine translation system on each of these corpora we hoped to gauge the size of the research problem we are addressing. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the design and creation of the corpora used in the experiments; Section 3 presents the experiment’s methodology; Section 4 reports the results found; and Section 5 both discusses the results and describes an approach to the problem that we will implement in future work. 2 Related work The work of Fazly et al.

Thus, they must be properly handled and translated by a Machine Translation system. Given the results of our experiments it is evident that the problem in translating idioms has not been solved using a standard SMT system. Such evidences and the relatively small amount of current related work on idiomatic expression translation, when compared with the amount of work on other MT aspects, indicates that there is likely not a trivial solution. To start addressing these problems, we propose a hybrid method inspired by the work developed by Okuma et al. (2008) for translating unseen words using bilingual dictionaries. Our method, introduced in Salton et al. (2014), work as a pre and post-processing step. We first identify idioms in source sentences using an idiom dictionary. Then, we substitute the idiom in the source sentence with its literal meaning, taken from the dictionary and record the fact that this sentence contained a substituted idiom. For all sentences that are recorded as containing a substitution, after the translation we check if the original idiom that occurred in the source sentence has a corresponding idiom in the target language </context>

And also, none of these works address the idioms problem for the English/Brazilian-Portuguese language pair using SMT phrase-based systems. 3 Corpora Design and Collection The experiment we describe in this pa</context>

In other words the meaning of an idiom is not simply the joint meaning of the individual words (Garrao and Dias, 2001). For example, the expression kick the bucket has an idiomatic meaning (to die) that has nothing to do with the meaning of kick or bucket. Idioms are a type of multi-word expressions (MWEs) often used in a large variety of texts and by human speakers and thus appear in all languages (Fazly et al., 2008). Consequently, they pose problems to most Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications (Sag et al., 2002). Nevertheless, they often have been overlooked by researchers in NLP (Fazly et al., 2008). As a class, idioms exhibit a number of properties that make them difficult to handle for NLP applications. For example, idiomatic expressions vary with respect to how morphosyntatically fixed they are. An idiomatic expression is highly fixed if the replacement of any of its constituents by a, syntactically or semantically, similar word causes the idiomatic meaning of the expression to be lost (Fazly et al., 2008). An example of a highly fixed idiom in English is the expression by and large. Idioms that </context>

Given the results of our experiments it is evident that the problem in translating idioms has not been solved using a standard SMT system. Such evidences and the relatively small amount of current related work on idiomatic expression translation, when compared with the amount of work on other MT aspects, indicates that there is likely not a trivial solution. To start addressing these problems, we propose a hybrid method inspired by the work developed by Okuma et al. (2008) for translating unseen words using bilingual dictionaries. Our method, introduced in Salton et al. (2014), work as a pre and post-processing step. We first identify idioms in source sentences using an idiom dictionary. Then, we substitute the idiom in the source sentence with its literal meaning, taken from the dictionary and record the fact that this sentence contained a substituted idiom. For all sentences that are recorded as containing a substitution, after the translation we check if the original idiom that occurred in the source sentence has a corresponding idiom in the target language by consulting a separate bilingual dictionary. If there is a corresponding idiom in the target language th</context>

Hence, standard phrase-based SMT systems do not model idioms explicitly (Bouamor et al., 2011). Unfortunately modelling idioms in order to improve SMT is not well studied (Ren et al., 2009) and examples of the difficulties in translating these expressions can be seen in the quality of the resultant output of most Machine Translation 36 Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation (HyTra) @ EACL 2014, pages 36–41, Gothenburg, Sweden, April 27, 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics systems (Vieira and Lima, 2001). Our long-term research goal is to investigate how the translation of idiomatic expressions may be improved. We will initially focus on the case of English/Brazillian-Portugese but we intend our work to be generalizable to other language pairs. As a first step on this research program we wished to scope the impact of idioms on an SMT system. In order to test this we ran an experiment that compared the BLEU scores of an SMT system when it was tested on three distinct sentence aligned corpora. Two of these test corpora consisted of sentences containing idiomatic (rather than literal) usages of </context>

Our results show that on sentences containing idioms a standard SMT system achieves about half the BLEU score of the same system when applied to sentences that do not contain idioms. We also provide a short error analysis and outline our planned work to overcome this limitation. 1 Introduction and Motivation An idiom is an expression whose meaning is not compositional (Xatara, 2001). In other words the meaning of an idiom is not simply the joint meaning of the individual words (Garrao and Dias, 2001).

Welcome to Louhi 2014: The Fifth International Workshop on Health Text Mining and Information
Analysis, in Gothenburg, Sweden. The Louhi workshop series is an international, scientific, forum for
researchers and practitioners in the multidisciplinary area of health text mining and information analysis.
This research area has progressed and grown since the First Louhi workshop in Turku, 2008, addressing
challenging research issues in the health and biomedical domain, leading to more openly available
annotated corpora, tools, terminologies, etc. Moreover, work on other languages than the previously
dominating English is both increasing and maturing.
The importance of accurate and specific information extraction and classification from diverse health and
biomedical documents such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), scientific literature and online health
forums is evident for several differing purposes, e.g. detecting drugs and medications, adverse events,
building timelines, understanding information needs. Ontologies and terminologies for such tasks are
also crucial. The papers presented in this workshop all address these issues from different perspectives,
and on different languages such as Basque, Spanish, French, Danish, Swedish, German and English. The
Fifth Louhi workshop will provide a platform for important and useful discussions in this vivid research
area, and hopefully lead to many more fruitful endeavours.
We received in total 21 submissions from 11 countries and three continents, and after a rigorous double-
blind peer-review process we could accept 17 of these submissions (nine long papers and eight short
papers) to be published in the 2014 Louhi proceedings. The acceptance rate for long papers was 60%,
while the overall acceptance rate for the workshop was 81%.
A short description of each paper follows in order of appearance.
Long papers:
Medical queries in a Swedish health portal are studied from the perspective of supporting information
needs by using semantic- and graph-based methods (Moradi et al.).
Collier et al. experiment with five strategies for mitigating the impact of near domain transference for
biomedical named entity recognition. Distributional dissimilarities of domains need to be adequately
compensated during learning, or else lower performance and higher annotation costs are expected.
Zhao and Tou Ng also address domain adaptation, but in the area of coreference resolution, using active
learning methods and target domain instance weighting.
Discourse parsing is addressed in the paper by Stepanov and Riccardi, where cross-domain evaluation
of a discourse relation parser trained on one domain generalises well across domains with feature-level
domain adaptation.
Perez-de-Viñaspre and Oronoz present initial work on semi-automatically translating SNOMED CT into
Basque, using the English version of SNOMED CT as source and then adapting the terms to Basque
utilizing various rules.
A method for building FrameNet-like corpora using ontologies is described in the paper by Tan. The
system includes algorithms for selecting and describing appropriate concepts to be translated into
semantic frames.
Quan and Ren describe work on gene-disease association extraction by combining information filtering,
grammar parsing and network analysis. With breast cancer as testing disease, they achieve 83.9%
accuracy for the testing genes and diseases and 74.2% accuracy for the testing genes.
iii
Segura-Bedmar et al. describe work on detecting drugs and adverse events from Spanish health
social media posts. A gold standard is created for evaluation, and a multilingual text analysis engine,
Textalytics, was applied for automatic detection, achieving 80%/56% precision, and 87%/85% recall for
drugs/adverse events.
The paper by Moen et al. presents several methods for information retrieval, focusing on care episode
retrieval based on textual similarity using distributional semantics and ICD-10 codes of diagnoses, to
retrieve the most similar care episodes among the records.

<bodyText confidence="0.97641752173913">
Engel Thomas et al. present work on text mining of Danish health records, with a focus on handling
spelling and ending variations, gaps and shuffling of terms, as well as negation identification and scope.
Spelling variation was found to be the most important functionality.
A new annotated corpus for identifying phenotype information for congestive heart failure is presented
by Alnazzawi et al. This corpus is unique in that it integrates information both from electronic health
records and literature articles.
Medication extraction, as defined in the 2009 i2b2 challenge, is addressed by using agile text mining
methods in the paper by Shivade et al. They report results of 92% precision and 71.5% recall.
Roller and Stevenson describe work using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) for distantly
supervised relation extraction.
Casillas et al. describe work on extracting cause-effect relations between drugs and diseases, applied on
Spanish health records.
Semantic relations are integrated in a vector space model to tackle the problem of context-unawareness
and applied on an electronic health record corpus (Périnet and Hamon).
Kreuzthaler and Schulz present work on disambiguating period characters in German clinical discharge
summaries. An accuracy of 93% is reported for abbreviation detection and sentence delimitation.
The Heideltime system is used for identifying time expressions in English and French in the paper by
Hamon and Grabar. Results of 0.94 (French) and 0.85 (English) F-measure are reported on their adapted
version of the system.
Dear reader, most welcome to study these proceedings, which we hope will raise interest, open new
perspectives and generate new exciting research questions in health text mining and information analysis.

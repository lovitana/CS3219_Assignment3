<bodyText confidence="0.999675352941177">
Having a morphological analyzer is a very
critical issue especially for NLP related
tasks on agglutinative languages. This paper
presents a detailed computational analysis
of Kazakh language which is an
agglutinative language. With a detailed
analysis of Kazakh language morphology,
the formalization of rules over all
morphotactics of Kazakh language is
worked out and a rule-based morphological
analyzer is developed for Kazakh language.
The morphological analyzer is constructed
using two-level morphology approach with
Xerox finite state tools and some
implementation details of rule-based
morphological analyzer have been presented
in this paper.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999313125">
Kazakh language is a Turkic language which
belongs to Kipchak branch of Ural-Altaic
language family and it is spoken approximately
by 8 million people. It is the official language
of Kazakhstan and it has also speakers in
Russia, China, Mongolia, Iran, Turkey,
Afghanistan and Germany. It is closely related
to other Turkic languages and there exists
mutual intelligibility among them. Words in
Kazakh language can be generated from root
words recursively by adding proper suffixes.
Thus, Kazakh language has agglutinative form
and has vowel harmony property except for
loan-words from other languages such as
Russian, Persian and Arabic.
Having a morphological analyzer for an
agglutinative language is a starting point for
Natural Language Processing (NLP) related
researches. An analysis of inflectional affixes of
Kazakh language is studied within the work of
a Kazakh segmentation system (Altenbek and
Wang, 2010). A finite state approach for
Kazakh nominals is presented (Kairakbay and
Zaurbekov, 2013) and it only gives specific
alternation rules without generalized forms of
alternations. Here we present all generalized
forms of all alternation rules. Moreover, many
studies and researches have been done upon on
morphological analysis of Turkic languages
(Altintas and Cicekli, 2001; Oflazer, 1994;
Coltekin, 2010; Tantug et al., 2006; Orhun et al,
2009). However there is no complete work
which provides a detailed computational
analysis of Kazakh language morphology and
this paper tries to do that.
The organization of the rest of the paper is
as follows. Next section gives a brief
comparison of Kazakh language and Turkish
morphologies. Section 3 presents Kazakh vowel
and consonant harmony rules. Then, nouns with
their inflections are presented in Section 4.
Section 4 also presents morphotactic rules for
nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs and
numerals. The detailed morphological structure
of verbs is introduced in Section 5. Results of
the performed tests are presented together with
their analysis in Section 6. At last, conclusion
and future work are described in Section 7.

2 Comparison of Closely Related
Languages

<bodyText confidence="0.999979928571429">
There are many studies and researches prior
made on closely related languages by
comparing them for many purposes related with
NLP such as Turkish–Crimean Tatar (Altintas
and Cicekli, 2001), Turkish–Azerbaijani
(Hamzaoğlu, 1993), Turkish–Turkmen (Tantuğ
et al., 2007), Turkish-Uygur (Orhun et al, 2009)
and Tatar-Kazakh (Salimzyanov et al, 2013). A
deep comparison of Kazakh and Turkish
languages from computational view is another
study which is in out of scope for this work.
However, in this study, a brief grammatical
comparison of these languages is given in order
to give a better analysis of Kazakh language.

Kazakh and Turkish languages have many
common parts due to being in same language
family. Possible differences are mostly
morpheme based rather than deep grammar
differences. Distinct morphemes can be added
in order to get same meaning. There exist some
differences in their alphabets, their vowel and
consonant harmony rules, their possessive
forms of nouns, and inflections of verbs as
given in Table 1. There are extra 9 letters in
Kazakh alphabet, and Kazakh alphabet also has
4 additional letters for Russian loan words.
Both Kazakh language and Turkish employ
vowel harmony rules when morphemes are
added. Vowel harmony is defined according to
last morpheme containing back or front vowel.
In Kazakh language, if the last morpheme
contains a back vowel then the vowel of next
coming suffix is a or a. If the last morpheme
contains one of front vowels then the vowel of
next coming suffix is e or i. In Turkish, suffixes
with vowels a, a, u follow morphemes with
vowels a, o, u, a and suffixes with vowels e, i, ü
follow morphemes with vowels e, i, ü, o
depending on being rounded and unrounded
vowels. Consonant harmony rule related with
voiceless letters is similar in both languages.

In Kazakh language there are 8 types of

There are some identical tenses and moods
of verbs in both language such as definite past
tense, present tense, imperative mood, optative
mood and conditional mood. They have nearly
same morphemes for tenses. On the other hand
there are some tenses of verbs which are
identical according to meaning and usage, but
different morphemes are used. Moreover, in
Kazakh language there are some tenses such as
goal oriented future and present tenses which
do not exist in Turkish language.

<bodyText confidence="0.999937071428571">
Kazakh is officially written in the Cyrillic
alphabet. In its history, it was represented by
Arabic, Latin and Cyrillic letters. Nowadays
switching back to Latin alphabets in 20 years is
planned by the Kazakh government. In the
beginning stage of study, Latin transcription of
Cyril version is used for convenience.
Two main issues of language such as
morphotactics and alternations can be dealt
with Xerox tools. First of all, morphotactic
rules are represented by encoding a finite-state
network. Then, a finite-state transducer for
alternations is constructed. Then, the formed
network and the transducer are composed into a

Table 4. Alternation rules according to groups
of letters.
All alternation rules for suffixes depend on
the last letter of a morpheme with in
morphotactic rules and Table 4 gives some
groupings that can be made in order to set some
generalized rules overall. Patterns of last letters
of morphemes in Table 4 are matched with
groups of letters presented in Table 3. In Table
4, Locative case affix is –dA, if the last letter of
a morpheme is one of Vowel, Sonorous

Consonant or Voiced Consonant of Type 1 in
Table 3. On the other hand, it is –tA, if the last
letter is Voiceless Consonant or Voiced
Consonant of Type 2. Here A is for a or e
according to last syllable of containing Front or
Back Vowel.
In Table 4, boxes presented by numbers
such as 1, 2 and 3 are used for personal
possessive agreements in Table 2. For example,
word Eke, “father” in Ablative case without a
possessive agreement takes suffix –den,
because the word Eke ends with vowel e.
However, in third person possessive agreement
it takes suffix –nen, because all words with
third person possessive agreement in Ablative
case always take suffix –nen even though the
third person possessive agreement morpheme
ends with vowel.
According to those similarities in Table 4,
there are some generalized rules which are valid
in many cases in grammar including verbs and
derivations. Some of these generalized rules
derived from close patterns given in Table 4,
are given in Table 5. For example, Rule 12 in
Table 5 represents rules for Locative and Dative
cases in Group 1 in Table 4. In Table 4,
Locative and Dative suffix rules are nearly
identical and have same patterns which can be
observed visually. Also, Accusative and
Possessive Pronouns of Type 2 are same.

In Dative case of GROUP 1 in Table 4, if
the last letter is Back Vowel then T is replaced
by G and T is replaced by g if the last letter is
Front Vowel. Thus, a word bala, “child”
becomes bala-Ga, “to child” and a word Eke,
“father” will be Eke-ge, “to father”. If the last
letter is Voiceless Consonant, T is replaced by q
or k depending on whether the last syllable
contains Back Vowel or Front Vowel. For
example, a word kitap-qa, “to book” has the
last letter of Voiceless Consonant and the last
syllable contains Back Vowel, thus T is
replaced by q. A word mektep-ke, “to school”
has the last letter of Voiceless Consonant and
the last syllable contains Front vowel, thus T is
replaced by k.
After detailed analysis of the language it
can be seen that there are mainly common rules
of alternations valid over all grammar. There
are about 25 main alternation rules defined for
all system together with generalized rules and 7
exception rules for each case. All these rules are
implemented with XFST tools (Beesley and
Karttunen, 2003). For instance, some mainly
used common rules are given below and they
are called by capital letters defined only in
intermediate level. As mentioned before they
are invisible by user. Here 0 is for empty
character.
Rule H &amp; Rule B: H is realized as 0 or J, B is
realized as 0 or A.
[H-&gt;0,B-&gt;0||[Vowel]%+_[Cons]]
[H-&gt;J,B-&gt;A]
If the last letter of a morpheme is Vowel and
the first letter of the following suffix is
Consonant then H and B are realized as 0.
Otherwise, they are realized as J and B. Some
examples are:

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.933009058823529">
Nouns in Kazakh Language take singular or
plural (A3Sg, A3Pl) suffixes, Possessive
suffixes, Case suffixes and Derivational
suffixes. In addition, nouns can take Personal
Agreement suffixes when they are derived into
verbs. For example, kitap-tar-da-GI-lar-dIN
which means “of those which is in books” has
the following morphological analysis
kitap+Noun+A3Pl+Pnon+Loc^DB+Noun+Zer
o+A3Pl+Pnon+Gen.
Every nominal root at least has form of
Noun+A3Sg+Pnon+Nom. Therefore, a root
noun kitap which means “book” has the
following morphological analysis
kitap+Noun+A3Sg+Pnon+Nom.
These inflections of noun are given in FST
diagram in Figure 1.

Figure 1. The FSA model of inflectional
changes of a noun.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.934244909090909">
It can be seen that nominal root can be in
singular form by adding (+0) no suffix which is
in fact third personal singular agreement
(A3Sg) and by adding suffix (+PAr) in plural
form which is in fact third personal plural
agreement (A3Pl). Here P is an intermediate
level representation letter for d, t or l in surface
level. After, possessive affixes (+Pnon:0,
+P1Sg:Hm, +P2Sg:HN, +P2PSg:HNJz, +P3Sg:sJ,
+P1Pl:HmJz, +P2Pl:HN, +P2PPl:HNJz, +P3Pl:s)
and case affixes (Nom, Dat, Abl, Loc, Acc, Gen,
Ins) are added. Here H and J are intermediate
letters. All morphotactic rules together with
adjective, pronoun, adverb and numerals are
given in Figure 2. It can be observed that every
adjective can be derived to noun and nouns
with relative affix can be derived to adjectives.
There are other derivations which are produced
by adding some specific suffixes between verbs
and nouns, adjectives and adverbs, adjectives
and nouns. In order to get rid of complex view
those derivations are not explicitly shown in

In our system, the root of a word is a
starting point for morphemes defined in lexicon
file, and other morphemes are added according
to morphotactic rules. Thus, starting from a
root the system checks for all possible
following morphemes and if a word is matched
it gives appropriate output and moves to next
state. For example, a surface form of a word
kitaptan, “from a book” will have intermediate
form of “kitap+tan” after implemented
alternation rules. First it will check and find a
noun root from lexicon. Then after giving
output as “kitap+Ioun”, continues with next
state which is Singular/Plural. At this state it
will go on with 0 input giving output of +A3Sg
for singular form of noun. Then, the next state
will be Possessive Affix state to determine the
personal possessive suffix. Here it is 0, thus
epsilon transition which gives output as +Pnon.
Now the output is “kitap+Noun+A3Sg+Pnon”.
The next state is Case state in order to
recognize the case of noun. Thus, for given
input such as +tan, the output is determined as
+Abl and this continues until the system
reaches the final state or invalid state which is
unacceptable state not returned to user. All
possible morphemes are defined in the lexicon
and all states are visualized in Figure 2.

5 Verbs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99993312">
Verbs are terms which define actions and states.
Mainly three tenses exist such as present, future
and past as stated in Figure 3. Moreover,
conditional, optative and imperative moods are
also defined. However in detailed form there
are thirteen tenses together with modals in
Kazakh language. These tenses are worked out
from many resources where presentation and
naming have variance among each other
according to their scholars (Tuymebayev, 1996;
Mamanov, 2007; Isaeva and Nurkina, 1996;
Musaev, 2008). For example, according to
Isaeva and Nurkina (1996) awIspalI keler Saq
“Future Transitional Tense” denotes action in
future and has same affix as Present Tense.
However, Mamanov (2007) pointing out that
awIspalI keler Saq, “Future Transitional Tense”
denotes present action. Additionally, there are
large amount of auxiliary verbs which define
tenses and some modal verbs. However in cases
that auxiliary verbs are not used verbs become
as deverbial adverbs or participles which define
verb or noun (Demirci, 2006). In Figure 4,
morphotactic rules of verbs and modals are
given. Derivations of verbs to nouns and
adverbs with specific suffixes are shown with
asterisk in Figure 4.
Verbs can be in reflexive, passive, collective
and causative forms. For instance, verb tara-w
means “to comb”, tara-n-w in reflexive infinity
form, tara-l-w in passive infinity form, tara-s-w
in collective infinity and tara-tQJz-w and tara-
tTJr-w in causative infinity form. Here, Q, J
and T are intermediate letters. However not all
verbs can have all of these forms at the same
time.
Verbs in infinity form are generally formed
with last letter w. For example: kelw which
means “to come”. The system is performing
over generalization on verbs which take
auxiliary verb on appropriate tenses. Those
verbs are analyzed as derived adverbs or
incomplete verbs on that tense since every verb
of sentence should have personal agreement at
the end and personal agreement affix added to
the verb itself after the suffix of tense or to the
auxiliary verb. In constructed morphological
analyzer, we make analysis of every single
word and for that reason generalization of some
rules are made by giving more than one result.

For example, kel-geli tur-mIn means “I am
planning to come”. Here tur is an auxiliary
form which actually defines the tense of the
verb and takes personal agreement affix mIn.
Without an auxiliary verb, the word kel-geli
means “since coming” and derived as an
adverb. Thus compound verbs are examined
separately. Some of tenses have different
personal agreement endings and they are

6 Tests and Analysis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996512">
As mentioned before, the system is
implemented using Xerox finite-state tools for
NLP. Morphotactic rules and possible
morphemes are defined in lexicon file and
compiled with lexc tool. Alternation rules are
defined in regex file and rule transducer is
composed with lexicon file in one network with
xfst tool. Loan words, proper names and
technical terms are not included. System is
working in two directions as in lexical and
surface level. Due to the ambiguities in
language there is no one-to-one mapping
between surface and lexical forms of words and
the system can produce more than one result.
A large corpus of Kazakh words
(Qazinform, 2010) not seen by the
morphological analyzer before has been
continually analyzed in order to enhance the
system by adding new words to lexicon. There
are approximately 1000 words randomly
selected from web which exist in lexicon and
analyzed with the system. The percentage of
correctly analyzed words is approximately
96%. Most of the errors are mainly the errors
that occurred in the analysis of technical words
which do not obey alternation rules of Kazakh
Language. In Table 6, the w1.txt file has more
technical words than w2.txt file. The results of
the tests are given in Table 6. Errors due to
Rules are exception errors which are not
included in transducer yet. We hope in near
future enhancing of the system will be
performed by including all these rules. Also it
can be seen in Table 6 that Kazakh words have
2.1 morphologic parses on average.

better perspectives on all other aspects related
with NLP. However, formalization and
computational analysis of Kazakh language
morphology is not widely worked out. In other
words, there is a lack of tools for analysis of
Kazakh language morphology from
computational point of view. Moreover,
grammar resources contain variances depending
on scholars. For example, in some resources
there are twelve tenses, whereas in others there
are much less tenses of verbs. Naming of tenses
can also vary from source to source. To
summarize, building correctly working system
of morphological analysis by combining all
information is valuable for further researches
on language.
In this paper, a detailed morphological
analysis of Kazakh language has been
performed. Also, a formalization of rules over
all morphotactics of Kazakh languages is
worked out. By combining all gained
information, a morphological analyzer is
constructed. For future work, enhancing of
system by adding exception rules related with
loan words and proper names should be
performed. Having more stabilized system with
lessened possible rule errors some internal
details of character encoding will also be
solved. Moreover, releasing the working system
to users on the web and collecting feedbacks
are intended. These feedbacks from users can
help on improving the system capacity and
lessen any possible errors. This is planned to be
performed with using an open source
environment which is alternative to Xerox
XFST, namely Foma by Hulden (2009).

<abstract confidence="0.996537888888889">Having a morphological analyzer is a very critical issue especially for NLP related tasks on agglutinative languages. This paper presents a detailed computational analysis of Kazakh language which is an agglutinative language. With a detailed analysis of Kazakh language morphology, the formalization of rules over all morphotactics of Kazakh language is worked out and a rule-based morphological analyzer is developed for Kazakh language. The morphological analyzer is constructed using two-level morphology approach with Xerox finite state tools and some implementation details of rule-based morphological analyzer have been presented in this paper.</abstract>

Words in Kazakh language can be generated from root words recursively by adding proper suffixes. Thus, Kazakh language has agglutinative form and has vowel harmony property except for loan-words from other languages such as Russian, Persian and Arabic. Having a morphological analyzer for an agglutinative language is a starting point for Natural Language Processing (NLP) related researches. An analysis of inflectional affixes of Kazakh language is studied within the work of a Kazakh segmentation system (Altenbek and Wang, 2010). A finite state approach for Kazakh nominals is presented (Kairakbay and Zaurbekov, 2013) and it only gives specific alternation rules without generalized forms of alternations. Here we present all generalized forms of all alternation rules.

A word mektep-ke, “to school” has the last letter of Voiceless Consonant and the last syllable contains Front vowel, thus T is replaced by k. After detailed analysis of the language it can be seen that there are mainly common rules of alternations valid over all grammar. There are about 25 main alternation rules defined for all system together with generalized rules and 7 exception rules for each case. All these rules are implemented with XFST tools (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003). For instance, some mainly used common rules are given below and they are called by capital letters defined only in intermediate level. As mentioned before they are invisible by user.

A deep comparison of Kazakh and Turkish languages from computational view is another study which is in out of scope for this work. However, in this study, a brief grammatical comparison of these languages is given in order to give a better analysis of Kazakh language. 46 Proceedings of the 2014 Joint Meeting of SIGMORPHON and SIGFSM, pages 46–54, Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 27 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics Kazakh and Turkish languages have many commo</context>

Results of the performed tests are presented together with their analysis in Section 6. At last, conclusion and future work are described in Section 7. 2 Comparison of Closely Related Languages There are many studies and researches prior made on closely related languages by comparing them for many purposes related with NLP such as Turkish–Crimean Tatar (Altintas and Cicekli, 2001), Turkish–Azerbaijani (Hamzaoğlu, 1993), Turkish–Turkmen (Tantuğ et al., 2007), Turkish-Uygur (Orhun et al, 2009) and Tatar-Kazakh (Salimzyanov et al, 2013). A deep comparison of Kazakh and Turkish languages from computational view is another study which is in out of scope for this work. However, in this study, a brief grammatical comparison of these languages is given in order to give a better analysis of Kazakh language. 46 Proceedings of the 2014 Joint Meeting of SIGMORPHON and SIGFSM, pages 46–54, Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 27 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics Kazakh and Turkish languages have many common parts due to being in same language family. Possible differences are mostly morpheme based rather than deep grammar</context>

An analysis of inflectional affixes of Kazakh language is studied within the work of a Kazakh segmentation system (Altenbek and Wang, 2010). A finite state approach for Kazakh nominals is presented (Kairakbay and Zaurbekov, 2013) and it only gives specific alternation rules without generalized forms of alternations. Here we present all generalized forms of all alternation rules. Moreover, many studies and researches have been done upon on morphological analysis of Turkic languages (Altintas and Cicekli, 2001; Oflazer, 1994; Coltekin, 2010; Tantug et al., 2006; Orhun et al, 2009). However there is no complete work which provides a detailed computational analysis of Kazakh language morphology and this paper tries to do that. The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. Next section gives a brief comparison of Kazakh language and Turkish morphologies. Section 3 presents Kazakh vowel and consonant harmony rules. Then, nouns with their inflections are presented in Section 4. Section 4 also presents morphotactic rules for nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs and numerals. The detailed morphological structure of verbs is introduced in Section</context>

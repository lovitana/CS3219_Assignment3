The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) is an annual meeting organized
by SIGNLL, the ACL special interest group on natural language learning. CoNLL-2014 is the eighteenth
meeting in this series and will be held in Baltimore, Maryland, USA on June 26-27, 2014, in conjunction
with ACL-2014.
In the main session of CoNLL, we invited papers on all aspects of computational approaches to natural
language learning, as well as on machine reading, the special topic of interest this year. We received
90 submissions, of which 7 were eventually withdrawn, and accepted 20 of the remaining 83 papers.
The final version of each accepted paper was allowed nine content pages plus two pages with only
bibliographic references.
As in previous years, CoNLL-2014 hosts a high-profile NLP shared task, Grammatical Error Correction,
a continuation of the shared task in 2013. Papers of the shared task are collected in a companion volume
of the CoNLL-2014 proceedings.
Similar to the arrangement in last year, each accepted paper in CoNLL-2014 will be given an 18 minute
oral presentation slot, as well as a poster. There will be a poster session in the afternoon of each day,
consisting of papers presented orally earlier on the same day. The shared task posters will also participate
in the same poster session on Day 1.
We thank all of the authors who submitted their work to CoNLL-2014, as well as the program committee
for helping us select from among the many strong submissions. We are also grateful to our invited
speakers, Morten Christiansen and Tom Mitchell, who graciously agreed to give talks at CoNLL. Special
thanks to the best paper award committee members, Walter Daelemans, Joakim Nivre and Dan Roth,
who helped choose the best paper winner. Also thanks to Xavier Carreras and Alexander Clark, for
their valuable advice, to the SIGNLL information officer, Erik Tjong Kim Sang, for publicity and to Ben
Verhoeven for maintaining the CoNLL Web site. We also appreciate the additional help we received
from the ACL program chairs, workshop chairs, and publication chairs.
Finally, many thanks to Microsoft Research and Google for sponsoring CoNLL-2014.
We hope you enjoy the conference!

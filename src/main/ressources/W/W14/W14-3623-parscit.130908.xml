Most opinion mining methods in English
rely successfully on sentiment lexicons,
such as English SentiWordnet (ESWN).
While there have been efforts towards
building Arabic sentiment lexicons, they
suffer from many deficiencies: limited
size, unclear usability plan given Ara-
bic’s rich morphology, or non-
availability publicly. In this paper, we
address all of these issues and produce
the first publicly available large scale
Standard Arabic sentiment lexicon (Ar-
SenL) using a combination of existing re-
sources: ESWN, Arabic WordNet, and
the Standard Arabic Morphological Ana-
lyzer (SAMA). We compare and com-
bine two methods of constructing this
lexicon with an eye on insights for Ara-
bic dialects and other low resource lan-
guages. We also present an extrinsic
evaluation in terms of subjectivity and
sentiment analysis.

Opinion mining refers to the extraction of sub-
jectivity and polarity from text (Pang and Lee,
2005). With the growing availability and popu-
larity of opinion rich resources such as online
review sites and personal blogs, opinion mining
is capturing the interest of many researchers due
to its significant role in helping people make
their decisions (Taboada et al., 2011). Some
opinion mining methods in English rely on the
English lexicon SentiWordnet (ESWN) (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2006; Baccianella et al., 2010)
for extracting word-level sentiment polarity.

negative connotation of the words to combine
them and derive the polarity of the text (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2005).
Recently, special interest has been given to
mining opinion from Arabic texts, and as a re-
sult, there has also been interest in developing an
Arabic Lexicon for word-level sentiment evalua-
tion. The availability of a large scale Arabic
based SWN is still limited (Alhazmi et al., 2013;
Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012; Elarnaoty et al.,
2012). In fact, there is no publicly available large
scale Arabic sentiment lexicon similar to ESWN.
Additionally there are limitations with existing
Arabic lexicons including deficiency in covering
the correct number and type of lemmas.
In this paper, we propose to address these chal-
lenges, and create a large-scale sentiment lexicon
benefiting from available Arabic lexica. We
compare two methods with an eye towards creat-
ing such resources for other Arabic dialects and
low resource languages. One lexicon is created
by matching Arabic WordNet (AWN) (Black et
al., 2006) to ESWN. This path relies on the ex-
istence of a wordnet, a rather expensive resource;
while the second lexicon is developed by match-
ing lemmas in the SAMA (Graff et al., 2009)
lexicon to ESWN directly. This path relies on the
existence of a mere dictionary, still expensive but
more likely available than a wordnet. Finally, the
combination of the two lexicons is used to create
the proposed large-scale Arabic Sentiment Lexi-
con (ArSenL). Each lemma entry in the lexicon
has three scores associated with the level of
matching for each of the three sentiment labels:
positive, negative, and objective.
The paper is organized as follows. A literature

There have been numerous efforts for creating
sentiment lexica in English and Arabic. Esuli and
Sebastiani (2006) introduced English Senti-
WordNet (ESWN), a resource that associates
synsets in the English WordNet (EWN) with
scores for objectivity, positivity, and negativity.
ESWN has been widely used for opinion mining
in English (Denecke, 2008; Ohana and Tierney,
2009). Staiano and Guerini (2014) introduced
DepecheMood, a 37K entry lexicon assigning
emotion scores to words. This lexicon was creat-
ed automatically by harvesting social media data
and affective annotated data.
In the context of developing sentiment lexica
and resources for Arabic, Abdul-Mageed et al.
(2011) evaluated the use of an adjective polarity
lexicon on a manually annotated portion of the
Penn Arabic Treebank. They describe the pro-
cess of creating the adjective polarity lexicon
(named SIFAAT) in Abdul-Mageed and Diab
(2012) using a combination of manual and auto-
matic annotations. The manual annotation con-
sisted of extracting 3,982 Arabic adjectives from
the Penn Arabic Tree (part 1) and manually la-
beling them into three tags: positive, negative or
neutral. The automated annotation relied on the
automatic translation of the ESWN synsets and
glosses using Google translate. More recently,
Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2014) extended their
lexicons creating SANA, a subjectivity and sen-
timent lexicon for Arabic. SANA combines dif-
ferent pre-existing lexica and involves extensive
manual annotation, automatic machine transla-
tion and statistical formulation based on point-
wise mutual information. The process also in-
volved gloss matching across several resources
such as THARWA (Diab et al., 2014) and SA-
MA (Graff et al., 2009). SANA included 224,564
entries which cover Modern Standard Arabic
(MSA) as well as Egyptian and Levantine dia-
lects. These entries are not distinct and possess
many duplicates. Through these different publi-
cations, the authors heavily rely on two types of
techniques: manual annotations, which can be
rather expensive (yet accurate) and automatic
translation which is cheap (but very noisy since
the Arabic output is not diacritized and no POS
information was used). Their SANA lexicon has
a mix of lemmas and inflected forms, many of
which are not diacritized. This is not a problem
in itself, but it limits the usability of the resource.
That said, we use their annotated PATB corpus
and SIFAAT lexicon for evaluating our lexicon.
We focus on these two resources because they
were manually created and are of good quality.
Alhazmi et al. (2013) linked the Arabic Word-
Net to ESWN through the provided synset offset
information. Their approach had limited cover-
age (~10K lemmas only) and did not define a
process for using the lexicon in practical applica-
tion given Arabic’s complex morphology. Fur-
thermore it is not yet publicly available and was
not evaluated in the context of an application.
In addition to English and Arabic sentiment
lexica development, recent efforts were put to
develop a multilingual sentiment lexicon. Chen
and Skienna (2014) proposed an automatic ap-
proach for creating sentiment lexicons for 136
major languages that include Arabic by integrat-
ing several resources to create a graph across
words in different languages. The resources used
were Wiktionary, Machine translation (Google),
Transliteration and WordNet. They created links
across 100,000 words by retrieving five binary
fields using the above four resources. Then using
a seed list obtained from Liu’s English lexicon
(2010) the sentiment labels are propagated based
on the links in the developed graph. The result-
ing Arabic sentiment lexicon which is of small
size was compared to SIFAAT (Abdul-Mageed
and Diab, 2012).
We are inspired by these efforts for Arabic sen-
timent lexicon creation. We extend them by
comparing different methods for creating such a
resource with implications for other languages.
Our lexicon is not only large-scale with high
coverage and high accuracy, but it is also public-
ly available. Finally, our lemma-based lexicon is
linked to a morphological analyzer for ease of
use in conjunction with Arabic lemmatizer such
as MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005).

We define our target Arabic Sentiment Lexicon
(or ArSenL) as a resource, pairing Arabic lem-
mas used in the morphological analyzer SAMA
with sentiment scores such as those used in
ESWN (positive, negative and neutral scores).
We briefly describe next the different resources
we use, followed by two methods for creating
ArSenL: using an existing Arabic WordNet or

The English WordIet (EWI) (Miller et al.,
1990) is perhaps one of the most used resources
for English NLP. Several offset-linked versions
of EWN have been released (2.0, 2.1, 3.0 and
3.1). The offset is a unique identifier for a synset
in EWN. EWN includes a dictionary augmented
with lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy,
etc.) and part-of-speech (POS) tags.
Arabic WordIet (AWI 2.0) (Black et al.,
2006) was part of a Global WordNet project
whose aim was to develop WordNets similar to
EWN but for different languages. AWN entries
are connected by offsets to EWN 2.0. AWN does
not include Arabic examples or glosses as EWN,
but include POS tags.
English SentiWordIet (ESWI 3.0) (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2006) is a large-scale English
Sentiment lexicon that provides for each synset
in EWN 3.0 three sentiment scores whose sum is
equal to 1: Pos, Neg, and Obj. ESWN has the
same offset mappings of EWN across its differ-
ent versions.

(SAMA 3.1) (Graff et al., 2009) is a commonly
used morphological analyzer for Arabic. Each
lemma has a POS tag and English gloss. The
analyzer produces for a given word all of its pos-
sible readings out of context.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999926">
3.2 Arabic WordIet-based Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998619119047619">
In this approach, we rely on the existence of a
richly annotated resource, namely a wordnet,
which is aligned to the ESWN. For Arabic, this
approach requires two steps: mapping AWN to
ESWN and mapping SAMA to AWN. The map-
ping between AWN to EWSN provides us with
the sentiment scores and the mapping between
AWN and SAMA provides us with the correct
lemma forms for the words in AWN. We refer to
the resulting lexicon as ArSenL-AWI.
Mapping AWI to ESWI. The entries in the
various Wordnet resources we use are nicely
linked through offsets to allow backward com-
patibility and linkage (see Figure 1). Figure 1
shows the connection with a walking example
for the word رْعَش $aEor1 ‘hair’. We use the avail-
able offset maps to link synsets in AWN 2.0 to
those in ESWN 3.0 and thus are able to assign
sentiment scores to the AWN 2.0 entries. We
make use of sense map files provided by Word-
Net that connect its three different versions 2.0,
2.1 and 3.0. Since some of the offsets were used
to refer to different entries in WordNet, POS tags
were also checked to validate the mapping. The
process of aligning AWN to ESWN yielded very
reliable links.
We manually checked each of the 9,692 terms in
AWN and their ESWN English complements.
Out of the 9,692, there were only 9 AWN words
that did not match with anything in ESWN; and
48 entries in AWN that had no lemmas to start
with although they were linked to ESWN. These
terms were dropped for the next processing per-
formed. Thus, this technique only allowed us to
line 9,635 synsets corresponding to 6,967 Arabic
lemmas. Through this process, we noticed that
there were no sense map files for adjectives in
WordNet which limited the mappings performed
in this approach to nouns and verbs only.
Mapping SAMA to AWI. The alignment of
Arabic lemmas in SAMA and AWN is compli-
cated due to several issues:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.711445625">
a. SAMA and AWN do not always agree on
lemma orthography, e.g., long vowel A is rep-
resented as A in SAMA and aA in AWN, and
the two resources do not always agree on
Hamzated Alif forms (Habash, 2010). The is-
sue of Hamzated Alif is solved by replacing it
in both resources by the letter A. The defini-
tion of lemmas varies between the two, e.g.,
SAMA does not use the definite article in
nouns, and uses the stem of the 3rd person
masculine singular verb (as opposed to full
form): katab not kataba ‘to write’.
b. AWN has multi-word lemmas, which SAMA
lacks.

Scheme (Buckwalter, 2004).

To address these issues, we first exclude the mul-
ti-word lemmas in AWN, which account for
1,695 lemmas out of 6,967 (24%). Of the rest,
exact matching against SAMA yields pairings for
1,736 lemmas. After applying a set of ortho-
graphic and lemma-form normalization rules as
indicated in Table 2, exact matching yields addi-
tional 1927 lemma matches. Finally, we back off
to using the SAMA morphological analyzer on
AWN terms and selecting the lemma with the
lowest edit distance. This step adds 1,094 lemma
matches. Overall, 7,326 synsets entries corre-
sponding to 5,002 lemmas in AWN are linked to
4,507 lemmas in SAMA. The linked lemmas ac-
count for 95% of all single word lemmas in
AWN, but only correspond to 12% of SAMA
lemmas. Moreover, we manually validated the
mapping between SAMA and AWN lemmas,
specifically the ones that were mapped using
SAMA back off with minimum edit distance
computation. 10% were not correct matches. We
corrected them and created a gold reference for
the lexicon, which we use in the evaluation sec-
tion. In Table 3, we report some entries that were
mapped wrongly between AWN and SAMA and
which were removed from the lexicon.

3.3 English Gloss-based Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997501541666666">
In this approach, we make use of the English
glosses associated with the SAMA lemma en-
tries. For each entry, we find the synset in
ESWN with the highest overlap in SAMA Eng-
lish glosses. A walking example of the described
method is shown in Figure 2. The recall of the
SAMA gloss is used as a confidence measure of
the mapping. We refer to the resulting lexicon as
ArSenL-Eng.
Each lemma in SAMA is appended with a gloss
list that varies in size from 1 up to 6 words. Let n
denote the number of words available in the
gloss list. We first attempt to match all the words
in the list to the glosses of each entry in ESWN.
If one or more matches are found, the scores are
retrieved and a new entry in SAMA is processed
as described. In case there were no matches, we
try to find an overlap between a combination of
n-1 words of the SAMA gloss list and the glosses
of ESWN. If one or more matches are found, the
scores are retrieved and each match is recorded
in ArSenL-Eng. Again, if no matches were ob-
tained, the same process is repeated for the com-
bination of n-2 words of the SAMA gloss list.

This procedure is followed until we span all the
words in the gloss list. As the number of words
used in the combination to check for overlap be-
tween the two resources decreases, the confi-
dence percentage decreases. In ArSenL-Eng, the
confidence measure is equal to the ratio of the
number of words overlapping between SAMA
and ESWN over the total number of words avail-
able in the gloss list of the corresponding SAMA
entry. Besides checking the overlap of glosses,
POS tags are also used to make sure that verbs
are not mapped to nouns and vice versa. This
technique results in mapping 150,700 ESWN

synsets corresponding to 28,540 distinct lemmas
in SAMA (76%). The validation of ArSenL-Eng
was performed (a) automatically by using Ar-
SenL-AWI and (b) manually by randomly vali-
dating 400 distinct lemmas. For the automated
part, we check for each common lemma between
the two lexicons if the sentiment scores match. A
total of 3,833 lemmas (out of 4,507) from Ar-
SenL-AWN were matched in ArSenL-Eng.
Thus, we can inspect that the precision of the
remaining scores is of 85%. For the manual vali-
dation, we check if the meaning of the SAMA
lemma corresponds to the one in ESWN. 70% of
the 400 randomly selected lemmas were accu-
rately mapped to ESWN. The main issue of the
remaining 30% is the unavailability of enough
glosses per SAMA lemma, which makes the
connection weaker. This approach did not in-
volve manual correction and the lemma numbers
are reported in row 4 of Table 5 along with their

We combine the two lexica created above by tak-
ing their union. We refer to the resulting lexicon
as ArSenL. The details of the sizes of the three
lexica are shown in Table 5.
The union of the two lexicons consisted of com-
bining the two resources and adding a field in the
lexicon to distinguish the original source of the
entry. For instance, an entry from the first ap-
proach, i.e. ArSenL-AWN, will have an AWN
offset while an entry in ArSenL-Eng will have
the same field set to N.A (Not Available). Fur-
thermore, due to manual correction performed to
ArSenL-AWN, the gold version of the union lex-
icon includes 28,780 lemmas with the corre-
sponding number of 157,969 synsets.
A public interface to browsing ArSenL is availa-
ble at http://oma-project.com. The interface al-
lows the user to search for an Arabic word. The
output would show the different scores for the
Arabic word along with the corresponding sen-
timent scores, English glosses and examples that
help in disambiguating different sentiment scores
for the same Arabic lemma. Work is also being
done to allow searching for English words and
finding the corresponding Arabic words. Snap-
shot of the homepage is shown in Figure 3.

We use nonlinear SVM implementation in
MATLAB, with the radial basis function (RBF)
kernel, to evaluate the different lexicons in the
context of SSA. The classification model is de-
veloped in two steps. In the first step, the kernel
parameters (kernel’s width 𝛾 and regularization
parameter 𝐶) are selected, and in the second step
the classification model is developed and evalu-

ated based on the selected parameters. To decide
on the choice of RBF kernel parameters, we use
the first 80% of the dataset to tune the kernel pa-
rameters to the values that produce the best F1-
score using 5-fold cross-validation. The resulting
parameters are then used to develop and evaluate
the SVM model using 5-fold cross-validation on
the whole dataset.
Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the
impact of the different lexicons on opinion min-
ing. The first experiment considers subjectivity
classification where sentences are classified as
either subjective or objective. In this experiment,
the SVM kernel parameters were tuned to max-
imize the F1-score for predicting subjective sen-
tences. The second experiment considers senti-
ment classification, where only subjective sen-
tences are classified as either positive or negative.
Subjective-neutral sentences are ignored. In this
experiment, the classifier’s parameters are tuned
to maximize the average F1-score of positive and
negative labels. We report the performance
measures of the individual classes, as well as
their average.
For baseline comparison, the majority class is
chosen in each of the experiments, where all sen-
tences are assigned to the majority class. For
subjective versus objective baseline classification,
all sentences were classified as subjective since
the majority (55.1%) of the sentences were sub-
jective. To further emphasize the importance of
detecting subjectivity, we chose the F1-score for
subjective as baseline. For positive versus nega-
tive baseline classification, all sentences were
classified as negative since the majority (58.4%)
of the dataset was annotated as negative. The
resulting baseline performance measures are cap-
tured in Table 6, and serve as basis for compari-
son with our developed models. For the subjec-
tive versus objective the baseline F1-score is
71.1%, and for positive versus negative, the
baseline F1-score is averaged as 36.9%.
Features We train the SVM classifier using sen-
tence vectors consisting of three numerical fea-
tures that reflect the sentiments expressed in each
sentence, namely positivity, negativity and ob-
jectivity. The value of each feature is calculated
by matching the lemmas in each sentence to each
of the lexicons separately: ArSenL-AWN, Ar-
SenL-Eng, ArSenL-Union and SIFAAT. The
corresponding scores are then accumulated and
normalized by the length of the sentence. We
remove all stop words in the process. For words
that occur in the lexicon multiple times, the aver-
age sentiment score is used. It is worth noting
that the choice of aggregation for the different
scores and the choice of nonlinear SVM was
concluded after a set of experiments, but not re-
ported in the paper. In this regards, we conducted
a suite of experiments to evaluate the impact of
using: (a) linear versus Gaussian nonlinear SVM
kernels, (b) normalization based on sentence
length, (c) normalization using z-score versus not,
and (d) using the confidence score from the lexi-
cons. Our best results across the different config-
urations reflected the best results with the non-
linear Gaussian RBF kernels, with sentence
length-based normalization and without confi-
dence weighting.

Results Three evaluations were conducted to
compare the performances of the developed sen-
timent lexicons. The results of the experiments
are shown in Table 6. First, we evaluate the cov-
erage of the different lexicons. We define cover-
age as the percentage of lemmas (excluding stop
words) covered by each lexicon. ArSenL-AWN
and SIFAAT have lower coverage than the Ar-
SenL-Eng lexicon. The union lexicon has the
highest coverage. This is normally due to the
larger number of lemmas included in the English
and union lexicons, as shown in Table 5.
In subjectivity classification, ArSenL lexicons
perform better than the majority baseline and
outperform SIFAAT in terms of F1-score. Over-
all, the developed ArSenL-Union gives the best
performance among all lexicons. The only ex-
ception of better performance for SIFAAT for
subjectivity is in terms of precision, which is as-
sociated with a much lower recall resulting in an
F1-score that is lower than that of ArSenL’s.

<bodyText confidence="0.999967515151515">
Similarly, sentiment classification experiment
reveals that ArSenL lexicons produce results that
are consistently better than SIFAAT and the ma-
jority baseline. The ArSenL-Union lexicon out-
performs all lexicons in all measures without
exceptions.
In summary, it can be observed that the English-
based lexicon produces results that are superior
to the AWN-based lexicon. Combining both re-
sources, through the union, allows further im-
provement in SSA performance. It is also worth
noting that the English and union lexicons con-
sistently outperform SIFAAT despite the fact
that the latter was manually derived from the
same corpus we are using for evaluation. We
close by showing examples of ArSenL in Table 7.
The lemmas are in their Buckwalter (2004) for-
mat for easier integration in any NLP task. The
word NA stands for Not Applicable. In the case
where AWN Offset is NA and AWN lemma is
NA, this means that the entry is retrieved from
ArSenL-Eng. Otherwise, the entries are from
ArSenL-AWN. The additions to the lemmas such
as “_v1AR” , “_n1AR”, “_1” or “_2” can be
dropped when data processing is performed.
They were kept for easier retrieval in the original
sources (AWN and SAMA). We added the “Eng-
lish Gloss” field for easier understanding of the
Arabic word in the table. Moreover, it can be
seen that only positive and negative scores are
reported in the lexicon since the objective score
can be easily derived by subtracting the sum of
positive and negative scores from 1.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999969928571429">
We create a large sentiment lexicon for Arabic
sentiments using different approaches linking to
ESWN. We compared the two methods. Our
results show that using English-based linking
produces, on average, superior performance in
comparison to using the WordNet-based ap-
proach. A union of the two resources is better
than either and outperforms a high-quality manu-
ally-derived adjective sentiment lexicon for Ara-
bic.
In the future, we plan to make use of this lexicon
to develop more powerful SSA systems. We also
plan to extend the effort to Arabic dialects and
other languages.

<abstract confidence="0.999313782608696">Most opinion mining methods in English rely successfully on sentiment lexicons, such as English SentiWordnet (ESWN). While there have been efforts towards building Arabic sentiment lexicons, they suffer from many deficiencies: limited size, unclear usability plan given Ararich morphology, or availability publicly. In this paper, we address all of these issues and produce the first publicly available large scale Standard Arabic sentiment lexicon (Ar- SenL) using a combination of existing resources: ESWN, Arabic WordNet, and the Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer (SAMA). We compare and combine two methods of constructing this lexicon with an eye on insights for Arabic dialects and other low resource languages.

Some researchers used the stored positive or Wassim El-Hajj Computer Science Department American University of Beirut, Lebanon we07@aub.edu.lb negative connotation of the words to combine them and derive the polarity of the text (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005). Recently, special interest has been given to mining opinion from Arabic texts, and as a result, there has also been interest in developing an Arabic Lexicon for word-level sentiment evaluation. The availability of a large scale Arabic based SWN is still limited (Alhazmi et al., 2013; Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012; Elarnaoty et al., 2012). In fact, there is no publicly available large scale Arabic sentiment lexicon similar to ESWN. Additionally there are limitations with existing Arabic lexicons including deficiency in covering the correct number and type of lemmas. In this paper, we propose to address these challenges, and create a large-scale sentiment lexicon benefiting from available Arabic lexica.

The resources used were Wiktionary, Machine translation (Google), Transliteration and WordNet. They created links across 100,000 words by retrieving five binary fields using the above four resources. Then using a seed list obtained from Liu’s English lexicon (2010) the sentiment labels are propagated based on the links in the developed graph. The resulting Arabic sentiment lexicon which is of small size was compared to SIFAAT (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012). We are inspired by these efforts for Arabic sentiment lexicon creation. We extend them by comparing different methods for creating such a resource with implications for other languages. Our lexicon is not only large-scale with high coverage and high accuracy, but it is also publicly available. Finally, our lemma-based lexicon is linked to a morphological analyzer for ease of use in conjunction with Arabic lemmatizer such as MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005). 3 Approaches to Lexicon Creation We define our target Arabic Sentiment Lexicon (or ArSenL) as a resource, pairing Arabic lemmas used in th</context>

SANA combines different pre-existing lexica and involves extensive manual annotation, automatic machine translation and statistical formulation based on pointwise mutual information. The process also involved gloss matching across several resources such as THARWA (Diab et al., 2014) and SAMA (Graff et al., 2009). SANA included 224,564 entries which cover Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) as well as Egyptian and Levantine dialects. These entries are not distinct and possess many duplicates.

With the growing availability and popularity of opinion rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, opinion mining is capturing the interest of many researchers due to its significant role in helping people make their decisions (Taboada et al., 2011).

Several offset-linked versions of EWN have been released (2.0, 2.1, 3.0 and 3.1). The offset is a unique identifier for a synset in EWN. EWN includes a dictionary augmented with lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy, etc.) and part-of-speech (POS) tags. Arabic WordIet (AWI 2.0) (Black et al., 2006) was part of a Global WordNet project whose aim was to develop WordNets similar to EWN but for different languages. AWN entries are connected by offsets to EWN 2.0. AWN does not include Arabic examples or glosses as EWN, but include POS tags. English SentiWordIet (ESWI 3.0) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is a large-scale English Sentiment lexicon that provides for each synset in EWN 3.0 three sentiment scores whose sum is equal to 1: Pos, Neg, and Obj.

The issue of Hamzated Alif is solved by replacing it in both resources by the letter A. The definition of lemmas varies between the two, e.g., SAMA does not use the definite article in nouns, and uses the stem of the 3rd person masculine singular verb (as opposed to full form): katab not kataba ‘to write’. b. AWN has multi-word lemmas, which SAMA lacks. 1 Arabic transliteration is provided in the Buckwalter Scheme (Buckwalter, 2004). 167 AWN 2.0 EWN 2.0 EWN 2.1 EWN 3.0 ESWN 3.0 n 04952502 Hair n 4952502 05192227 05254795 Extract Sentiment Scores 05254795 Pos = 0.25 Obj = 0.75 Figure 1.

The ArSenL-Union lexicon outperforms all lexicons in all measures without exceptions. In summary, it can be observed that the Englishbased lexicon produces results that are superior to the AWN-based lexicon. Combining both resources, through the union, allows further improvement in SSA performance. It is also worth noting that the English and union lexicons consistently outperform SIFAAT despite the fact that the latter was manually derived from the same corpus we are using for evaluation. We close by showing examples of ArSenL in Table 7. The lemmas are in their Buckwalter (2004) format for easier integration in any NLP task. The word NA stands for Not Applicable. In the case where AWN Offset is NA and AWN lemma is NA, this means that the entry is retrieved from ArSenL-Eng. Otherwise, the entries are from ArSenL-AWN. The additions to the lemmas such as “_v1AR” , “_n1AR”, “_1” or “_2” can be dropped when data processing is performed. They were kept for easier retrieval in the original sources (AWN and SAMA).

Finally, the combination of the two lexicons is used to create the proposed large-scale Arabic Sentiment Lexicon (ArSenL). Each lemma entry in the lexicon has three scores associated with the level of matching for each of the three sentiment labels: positive, negative, and objective. The paper is organized as follows. A literature review presented in section 2 is conducted on work that involved developing multilingual lexi165 Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014</context>

The automated annotation relied on the automatic translation of the ESWN synsets and glosses using Google translate. More recently, Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2014) extended their lexicons creating SANA, a subjectivity and sentiment lexicon for Arabic. SANA combines different pre-existing lexica and involves extensive manual annotation, automatic machine translation and statistical formulation based on pointwise mutual information. The process also involved gloss matching across several resources such as THARWA (Diab et al., 2014) and SAMA (Graff et al., 2009). SANA included 224,564 entries which cover Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) as well as Egyptian and Levantine dialects. These entries are not distinct and possess many duplicates. Through these different publications, the authors heavily rely on two types of techniques: manual annotations, which can be rather expensive (yet accurate) and automatic translation which is cheap (but very noisy since the Arabic output is not diacritized and no POS information was used). Their SANA lexicon has a mix of lemmas and inflected forms, many of which are not diacritized. This is not a problem in itself, but i</context>

AWN entries are connected by offsets to EWN 2.0. AWN does not include Arabic examples or glosses as EWN, but include POS tags. English SentiWordIet (ESWI 3.0) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is a large-scale English Sentiment lexicon that provides for each synset in EWN 3.0 three sentiment scores whose sum is equal to 1: Pos, Neg, and Obj. ESWN has the same offset mappings of EWN across its different versions. Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer (SAMA 3.1) (Graff et al., 2009) is a commonly used morphological analyzer for Arabic. Each lemma has a POS tag and English gloss. The analyzer produces for a given word all of its possible readings out of context. 3.2 Arabic WordIet-based Approach In this approach, we rely on the existence of a richly annotated resource, namely a wordnet, which is aligned to the ESWN. For Arabic, this approach requires two steps: mapping AWN to ESWN and mapping SAMA to AWN. The mapping between AWN to EWSN provides us with the sentiment scores and the mapping between AWN and SAMA provides us with the correct lemma forms for the words in AWN.</context>

The resulting Arabic sentiment lexicon which is of small size was compared to SIFAAT (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012). We are inspired by these efforts for Arabic sentiment lexicon creation. We extend them by comparing different methods for creating such a resource with implications for other languages. Our lexicon is not only large-scale with high coverage and high accuracy, but it is also publicly available. Finally, our lemma-based lexicon is linked to a morphological analyzer for ease of use in conjunction with Arabic lemmatizer such as MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005). 3 Approaches to Lexicon Creation We define our target Arabic Sentiment Lexicon (or ArSenL) as a resource, pairing Arabic lemmas used in the morphological analyzer SAMA with sentiment scores such as those used in ESWN (positive, negative and neutral scores). We briefly describe next the different resources we use, followed by two methods for creating ArSenL: using an existing Arabic WordNet or using English glosses in a dictionary. 166 3.1 Resources We rely on four existing resources to create ArSenL: English WordNet (EWN), Arabic WordNet (AWN), English SentiWordNet (ESWN) and SAMA.

Thus, this technique only allowed us to line 9,635 synsets corresponding to 6,967 Arabic lemmas. Through this process, we noticed that there were no sense map files for adjectives in WordNet which limited the mappings performed in this approach to nouns and verbs only. Mapping SAMA to AWI. The alignment of Arabic lemmas in SAMA and AWN is complicated due to several issues: a. SAMA and AWN do not always agree on lemma orthography, e.g., long vowel A is represented as A in SAMA and aA in AWN, and the two resources do not always agree on Hamzated Alif forms (Habash, 2010). The issue of Hamzated Alif is solved by replacing it in both resources by the letter A. The definition of lemmas varies between the two, e.g., SAMA does not use the definite article in nouns, and uses the stem of the 3rd person masculine singular verb (as opposed to full form): katab not kataba ‘to write’. b. AWN has multi-word lemmas, which SAMA lacks. 1 Arabic transliteration is provided in the Buckwalter Scheme (Buckwalter, 2004). 167 AWN 2.0 EWN 2.0 EWN 2.1 EWN 3.0 ESWN 3.0 n 04952502 Hair n 4952502 05192227 05254795 Extract Sentiment Scores 05254795 Pos = 0.25 Obj = 0.75 Figure 1.

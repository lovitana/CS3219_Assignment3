Here, we investigate non-lexicalized synsets
found in the Hungarian wordnet, and compare
them to the English one, in the context of
wordnet building principles. We propose some
strategies that may be used to overcome diffi-
culties concerning non-lexicalized synsets in
wordnets constructed using the expand meth-
od. It is shown that the merge model could al-
so have been applied to Hungarian, and with
the help of the above-mentioned strategies, a
wordnet based on the expand model can be
transformed into a wordnet similar to that con-
structed with the merge model.

1 Introduction

Wordnets are lexical databases in which words
are organized into clusters based on their mean-
ings, and they are linked to each other through
different semantic and lexical relations, yielding
a conceptual hierarchy (i.e. lexical ontology) of
words. Originally, they were designed to show
how linguistic knowledge is organized within the
human mind (Miller et al., 1990). Multilinguality
is also an important aspect in the creation of
wordnets: builders of new wordnets usually map
their synsets to those representing the same con-
cept in Princeton WordNet (PWN).
However, there is no perfect mapping between
two languages at the conceptual level and the
lexical level. In this article, we would like to
compare the wordnets built for Hungarian and
English and we will discuss problems and possi-
ble solutions concerning discrepancies in the way
the two languages name certain concepts in the
context of wordnet-building methods and princi-
ples. First, the wordnets we study are briefly pre-
sented, then the notions of non-lexicalized and
technical non-lexicalized synsets are illustrated
with concrete examples. We suggest some ways
of eliminating non-lexicalized synsets from
wordnets, and we also show how a Hungarian
tree can be built without relying on the English

tree. Lastly, we argue that although a wordnet
that seeks to represent the hierarchy of the given
language should not contain non-lexicalized el-
ements, they can prove useful in fields of re-
search such as psycholinguistics, ethnography
and contrastive linguistics.

The first wordnet was created for the English
language at Princeton University, so it is called
the Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). It is
now the largest lexical database of the English
language, and it can be readily adapted to various
computational applications. Princeton WordNet
3.0 contains about 155,000 words in approxi-
mately 117,000 synsets.
Since then, other wordnets have been created
and developed for different languages. Eu-
roWordNet is a multilingual project, where
synsets for Dutch, Italian, Spanish, German,
French, Czech and Estonian are included in the
database (Alonge et al., 1998). The BalkaNet
project sought to extend EuroWordNet with lexi-
cal databases created for languages of the Balkan
Peninsula, namely Bulgarian, Greek, Turkish,
Serbian and Romanian (Tufiş, 2004; Tufiş et al.,
2004). Other languages for which wordnets have
been developed include Arabic, Croatian, Chi-
nese, Danish, Slovene, Polish, Russian, Persian,
Hindi, Tulu, Dravidian, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit,
Assamese, Filipino, Gujarati, Nepali (Tanács et
al., 2008; Bhattacharyya et al., 2010; Fellbaum
and Vossen, 2012).
Typically, there are two major approaches to
wordnet construction (Vossen, 1998). The first
approach (merge model) starts by constructing a
wordnet from scratch (or by using dictionaries
and other resources developed for the language)
and then the newly created synsets are linked to
synsets of another language (most typically Eng-
lish). The second approach (expand model) starts
by selecting a subset of the PWN synsets and
then they are transformed into synsets of the tar-
get language, preserving relations between
synsets. Wordnets created in this way inevitably
reflect lexicalization of the given language to a
lesser degree; however, it is known that the
nodes in PWN form a network, the rendering of
which into the given language may be unnatural,
forced and this may result in further difficulties
concerning multilingual applications (Raffaelli et
al., 2008). The merge model was used for most
languages in the EuroWordNet project (Alonge
et al., 1998), whereas the expand model was used
for Spanish, Hungarian and some other lan-
guages.
Now, languages do not overlap completely:
due to the differences in culture, traditions and
lifestyle, languages have concepts, words charac-
teristic of the given language alone. They can
only have approximate equivalents and cannot be
translated using a single word (Derwojedowa et
al., 2008), i.e. they cannot be lexicalized.
Lexicalization is defined in the following way
(Lipka, 1992: 107): “the process by which com-
plex lexemes tend to become a single unit with a
specific content, through frequent use. In this
process, they lose their nature as a syntagma, or
combination, to a greater or lesser extent.” Thus,
lexicalization can be regarded as a process that is
gradual, similar to the scalar view of productivity
(Jackendoff, 2010). Thus, there are lexicalized
items in the language, there are non-lexicalized
ones and there are borderline cases in between.
For non-lexicalized concepts, artificial nodes
may be introduced in wordnets so as to have a
better organized structure (Fellbaum, 1998). The
original PWN also contains a few such items,
e.g. bad person. However, there are wordnets
which contain only lexicalized concepts of a lan-
guage and no non-lexicalized synsets are includ-
ed. For instance, the Dutch wordnet does not in-
clude artificial synsets, producing a much flatter
hierarchy (Vossen, 1998). Despite this, the crea-
tors of the Basque wordnet tried to include as
many non-lexicalized multiword expressions as
possible (Agirre et al., 2006). They differentiate
between conceptual level imbalances and expres-
sion level imbalances, similar to Vossen (1999),
who distinguishes cultural gaps and pragmatic
gaps. The Basque wordnet, which was also built
following the expand model, explicitly codes
these non-lexicalized synsets (Pociello et al.,
2011).
The Hungarian WordNet (HuWN) was devel-
oped by the Research Institute for Linguistics of
the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the De-
partment of Informatics of the University of Sze-
ged, and MorphoLogic Ltd. in a 3-year project
(Alexin et al., 2006; Miháltz et al., 2008). As a
result, HuWN now contains over 40,000 synsets,
out of which 2,000 synsets form part of a busi-
ness subontology. Here, Princeton WordNet 2.0
served as a basis for the construction of HuWN,
i.e. the expand model was adhered to. More pre-
cisely, synsets belonging to the BalkaNet Con-
cept Set were selected from PWN 2.0 and then
translated into Hungarian. These were then man-
ually edited, corrected and extended with other
synonyms using the VisDic editor. The set of
concepts to be included in HuWN were expand-
ed concentrically later on. That is, descendants of
the existing synsets were treated as synset candi-
dates. The final decision on their status (whether
they should be included or excluded) was influ-
enced by several factors such as the frequency of
the concept and its presence in other WordNets
(Miháltz et al., 2008).
In this paper, we examine what the effects of
the expand model are on the quality of the Hun-
garian WordNet. We investigate the types of
non-lexicalized synsets and we propose some
strategies that may be used to overcome difficul-
ties concerning non-lexicalized synsets in word-
nets constructed using the expand method.

3 Non-Lexicalized Synsets
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999864173913043">
At its inception, developers of the Hungarian
wordnet decided that the so-called expand meth-
od should be used. This implies that HuWN in-
herited the hierarchy of PWN. The nominal and
adjectival parts1 of HuWN were built according
to the following method: nodes in PWN were
automatically correlated with Hungarian synsets
and their relations were adopted; the basic strate-
gy was to attach Hungarian entries of a bilingual
English-Hungarian dictionary to the nomi-
nal/adjectival synsets of PrincetonWordNet.
In order not to have “holes” in the constructed
tree (that is, in order for the English and Hungar-
ian wordnets to overlap as much as possible),
developers had to find a good way of handling
such synsets. To indicate that such synsets do not
exist (at the word level) in the lexicon of the giv-
en language, i.e. they have not become lexical-
ized, the non-lex label was introduced. Now, we
will give the criteria for a synset to be non-
lexicalized. First, it may be that no such concept
exists in the given language (especially due to
cultural differences). Second, the concept may be

expressed by productive and compositional con-
structions (e.g. with adjective + noun combina-
tions), i.e. there is no way of expressing it using
a single word or a multiword expression. Third,
the concept may be an umbrella term for several
single-word concepts, thus, in the other language
it may only be expressed by a list. Fourth, there
seemed to be inconsistencies or erroneous defini-
tions and hypernym relations in PWN, which the
builders of the Hungarian wordnet did not want
to follow and they marked the problematic synset
with the non-lex label.
Some statistics on non-lex synsets in HuWN
are presented in Table 1. It can be seen that for
the whole body of HuWN every twentieth synset
is non-lexicalized and for the basic concept set
(BCSHu) it is every twelfth synset. Hence, the
problem is not negligible and it is worth examin-
ing in detail what types of nonlex synsets exist
and how they can be eliminated.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994004896907217">
Non-lex synsets found in HuWN can be classi-
fied into six main groups, which are presented
below.
Culturally Determined Concepts. Culturally
determined concepts are related to differences in
culture, lifestyle or geographical background.
Since the American and Hungarian cultures,
(folk) traditions and backgrounds are quite dif-
ferent, there are concepts which not always have
verbatim equivalents in the other language. In
case they have, they may not reflect the feelings
and moods they evoke, that is, what comes to a
person‘s mind when he hears them may differ in
the two cultures (cf. Zidoum, 2008). Here we
provide two examples:
máglyarakás ‘stake’ (in Hungarian, it refers to
a kind of confectionery, which is not associated
with the English word stake).
Sassenach – a Scot’s term for an English per-
son, where connotations of the original word
cannot be mirrored in Hungarian.
Culturally determined concepts are called con-
ceptual level imbalances in the Basque wordnet
(Pociello et al., 2011).
Geographical background mostly determines
the named entities included in wordnets. For in-
stance, most Hungarian speakers are not familiar
with Milk River:1 or White River:1, thus their
inclusion would be questionable in the Hungari-
an wordnet. However, some of them are included
in HuWN due to the expand method applied, but
they are classed as non-lex.
Split Concepts. Another group of non-lex
synsets includes elements that simply have no
counterpart in the given language. Very often,
certain umbrella terms belonging to this category
can only be expressed in the other language by
using a paraphrase or supplying a list. For in-
stance, cycling:1 is used for both riding bicycles
and motorcycles, which are separate lexical units
in Hungarian.
Words with a Iegative Prefix. Another basic
example of non-lex synsets is that of adjec-
tives/nouns formed with negative prefixes such
as non-, in- and un-. Apart from a couple of cas-
es, in Hungarian, the negated version of such
lexical units is produced with a negative adverb
and they together do not constitute a lexicalized
synset. Examples of non-lex synsets in HuWN
formed with negative prefixes in PWN include
unattractive – nem vonzó, ill-timed – rosszul
időzített and incongruity – meg nem egyezés,
where the HuWn synsets are marked as non-
lexicalized.
Adjective + Ioun Constructions. Some con-
cepts in PWN are expressed with adjective +
noun constructions in Hungarian, which cannot
be regarded as lexicalized units since they are
productive and their meaning is totally composi-
tional. For instance, words denoting nationalities
(skót ‘Scottish’, angol ‘English’, magyar ‘Hun-
garian’ etc.) in Hungarian have a peculiar feature
that although there is no distinction of gender in
the nominal and pronominal system at the mor-
phological and syntactic levels, when using these
words we first and foremost mean a male person
of a nation: e.g. Scotsman:1 was annotated skót
(a Scottish male person). Their female counter-
part is usually formed by adding an extra noun,
nő ‘woman’. The two words skót nő ‘Scottish
woman’ when combined, however, are regarded
as a productive construction (of adjective +
noun) and not as a multiword expression, which
is a prerequisite for Hungarian adjective + noun
constructions to be admitted into HuWN as valid
synsets, and hence skót nő is a non-lexicalized
synset paired with Scotswoman:1, Scotchwom-
an:1.
Linguistic Differences. Sometimes non-
lexicalized synsets arise due to the ways a con-
cept can be expressed. In the case of people:1 –
(embercsoport), it can be expressed by a suffix in
Hungarian: the English phrase 200 people can
translated as kétszázan two.hundred-ESSIVE
into Hungarian, which means that a suffix denot-
ing the essive grammatical case is attached to the
number, and the suffix corresponds to the Eng-
lish noun.
Technical Terms. Over the course of time,
some non-lexicalized concepts may become lexi-
calized. One typical domain is technology, where
such concepts are spreading worldwide at an ev-
er accelerating rate. A few years ago, when
HuWN was being constructed, RV (recreational
vehicle) for instance was tagged non-lex, which,
now, could be accepted as a fully acknowledged
lexicalized synset.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998936">
3.2 Technical Non-Lexicalized Synsets
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995943827586207">
During the construction, it frequently happened
that two English synsets in hierarchical relation
had a single Hungarian equivalent; the two con-
cepts are distinct at the conceptual level only. At
the lexical level, however, it is impossible to find
two distinct words for them. In other cases, it
was not possible to find an equivalent for the
word with the same part of speech. Technical
non-lexicalized (t non-lex) tags are applied in the
following cases: (1) identical literals in hyper-
nym-hyponym relation; (2) identical literal in a
similar_to relation; (3) POS difference, which
are all illustrated below.
Identical Literals in Hypernymy Relation.
The first case of technically non-lexicalized tag-
ging in HuWN is when there are two identical
literals in synsets in hypernym relation. This
phenomenon is called autohyponimy in Cruse
(2000). The developers of HuWN wanted to
avoid such redundancies in the trees and, as a
convention, they eliminated the overlapping lit-
eral from one of the synsets.
Due to entailment, a concept can be replaced
by its hypernym: if a greyhound barks, then it
entails that a dog barks. So it seemed reasonable
to apply this axiom in HuWN building, i.e. to not
repeat the hypernym in the hyponym synset.
Here is an example (the numbers denoting levels
of hierarchy):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.672983">
1 cube:5 kocka:3
2 dice:1 dobókocka:1
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950545454546">
In this case, due to the above-mentioned con-
vention of having to delete the identical literal in
the hyponym synset, kocka has been excluded,
leaving only dobókocka as a hyponym. Thus,
there is no need to mark the hyponym synset as
technically non-lexicalized since there is another
literal which does not coincide with the hyper-
nym.
In cases where the hyponym synset consists of
only one literal, coinciding with its hypernym,
the hyponym synset is marked t non-lex:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9864785">
1 safety:1 biztonság:1
2 security:1 biztonság:0
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.993407944444444">
In Hungarian, there is no separate lexical item
for safety and security, these being roughly
equivalent to biztonság. In this way, the hypo-
nym synset should be marked as t non-lex.
Identical Literals in Focal-Satellite Synsets.
In the case of the adjectival part of the ontology,
the t non-lex label was also employed. Since its
construction is based on antonym-pairs and the
associated, synonymous “satellite” synsets, it
may well be that while distinct words in English
are used to express the concept belonging to the
focal and the satellite synsets, in Hungarian, the
same word occurs in both positions. Yet, the
conventions of wordnet building require that the
focal and the satellite synsets should contain no
identical literals (cf. identity of hypernym and
hyponym). Consequently, again, the course to be
followed is that the focal synset remains lexical-
ized and the more specific, satellite synset gets
the t non-lex label. For example, {wide:1;
broad:1}’s “satellite” synset is {heavy:5;
thick:5}, but in Hungarian széles corresponds to
both, therefore the focal synset will be
{széles:2}, and the satellite synset {széles:0}.
Different Parts of Speech. Sometimes the
target language equivalent of a synset does not
share its part of speech with the source language
word although it can be classified as one of the
four parts of speech used in wordnets. For in-
stance, the English word afraid is an adjective,
but its Hungarian counterpart fél is a verb. In
such cases, we made use of the relation
eq_xpos_synonym, which designates synonymy
among different parts of speech: here it relates fél
and the Hungarian adjectival synset correspond-
ing to afraid, which is marked as t non-lex.

4.1 Problems in the Tree

<bodyText confidence="0.999865833333333">
In certain cases, there is an incongruence be-
tween a synset and its hypernym. For instance,
location:1 in PWN is defined as a point or extent
in space; one of its hyponyms is bilocation:1
with the definition of the ability (said of certain
Roman Catholic saints) to exist simultaneously in
two locations (unique beginner synset: entity:1).
To our mind, this relation is invalid as their defi-
nitions are incompatible and only seem to make a
formal hyper-hyponym pair. Instead, bilocation
should be linked to ability:2, pow-
er:3/képesség:2 on the basis of the definition
given in PWN, or it could be also linked to phe-
nomenon:1/jelenség:1. If the structure of PWN
is to be preserved in HuWN, this synset should
be marked as non-lex and a new synset should be
created under the correct hypernym (képesség:2
or jelenség:1).

<bodyText confidence="0.999996">
In our opinion, in certain cases the annotators of
HuWN made some mistakes. For instance, la-
bor:1 is now a non-lex synset but it should have
been classed as a full-fledged lexicalized synset,
a multiword expression fizikai munka ‘physical
work’. Similarly, we think that seating:1, area:1
should have been included as ülőhely ‘seat’.

An interesting example of non-lex synsets is bow
and arrow:1/ij és nyilvessző:1. In our view, the
synset was incorrectly tagged lexicalized as –
though the two parts make up a single weapon –
the projector (bow) and the projectile (arrow) do
not form a lexicalized phrase in Hungarian.
Attempts to find a Hungarian equivalent for
PWN synsets sometimes led to such completely
non-existent (although possible) synsets in Hun-
garian as fúvóeszköz:1 (blower:1).

5 Eliminating Non-Lex Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981909090909">
The large number of non-lexicalized synsets in
the Hungarian wordnet raises questions concern-
ing the (organizing) principles of the Hungarian
wordnet. Non-lex synsets – strictly speaking –
are not part of the given language, and wordnets
including many non-lexicalized items can hardly
be regarded as reflecting the concepts of the giv-
en language. In order to overcome these prob-
lems, we propose to minimize the number of
non-lexicalized synsets with the help of four
strategies, which are presented below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.9976">
5.1 Shortening the Tree
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998875">
We suggest that non-lex synsets without any hy-
ponym should be deleted from the tree. As hy-
pernyms can substitute hyponyms in every con-
text (see Section 3.2.1), this strategy does not
undermine the expressibility of certain concepts.
This might be useful in the following trees:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.9870255">
1 freedom:1 szabadság:1
2 liberty:1 (szabadság)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820625">
There is no distinction made between the
senses of the PWN concepts in Hungarian, thus,
the lower non-lex synset should be deleted. This
solution may be applied to certain culture- or
geography-specific synsets as well. For instance,
it proved sufficient to include only the major riv-
ers of the United States in HuWN, as there was
no need to adapt all the rivers listed in PWN.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998412">
5.2 Flattening the Tree
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999484">
Split concepts that can be paraphrased by giving
a list should simply be deleted from the tree and
all of their hyponyms can be attached to the hy-
pernym of the deleted synset. For instance, there
are two non-lex synsets in the following tree:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.836601333333333">
1 occupation:1, business:6, foglalkozás:1,
job:1, line of work:1, munka:3, hivatás:2,
line:19 pálya:6
2 profession:2 (foglalkozás)
3 learned profession:1 (jog, orvostan és hit-
tudomány)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.98344025">
4 law:5, practice of law:1 jog:2, jogtudomány:1
medicine:3, practice of orvostudomány:1
medicine:1
theology:3 hittudomány:1
The first non-lex synset corresponds to the
same lexical item as its hypernym in Hungarian,
so it is unnecessary to include the non-lex synset
in the Hungarian wordnet. The second non-lex
synset corresponds to an umbrella term in Eng-
lish, which has no proper Hungarian counterpart.
Instead, the following tree should reflect the real
conceptual hierarchy in Hungarian:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.80048025">

2 jog:2, jogtudomány:1

</equation>

5.3 Restructuring the Tree
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998579666666667">
In certain cases, the reconstruction of the tree
may be the most effective. First of all, let us il-
lustrate the problem with two charts representing
the corresponding PWN and HuWN tree-sections
(Hungarian paraphrases are equivalent to PWN
definitions):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.878038285714286">
1 building:1 épület:1
2 place of (istentisztelet helye “place of

tian church”)
temple:1 (nem keresztény templom
“non-Christian church”)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997336875">
In PWN, church:2 and temple:1 are hyponym
synsets of place of worship:1 at the same level
while, at present, they have no lexicalized coun-
terparts in the Hungarian wordnet. In order to
eliminate the three non-lexicalized synsets in
HuWN and to have lexicalized items there, we
propose a solution in which templom (meaning a
building for the worship of any deity or any reli-
gion in Hungarian, without distinguishing be-
tween a Christian or non-Christian place of wor-
ship) is placed in the hypernym position in paral-
lel with place of worship:1 and the two hypo-
nym synsets in PWN have no counterparts in the
Hungarian tree. All the original hyponyms of
church and temple can be linked under tem-
plom in Hungarian now.

5.4 Lexicalizing the Concept
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
In some cases, it happened that wordnet builders
had made an error and marked lexicalized con-
cepts as non-lex (see Section 4.2). In other cases
(see Section 3.1.6), certain concepts (mostly
from the technological domain) became lexical-
ized over time and now they are genuine mem-
bers of the Hungarian language. The non-lex la-
bel of these synsets should be deleted and the
synset should be treated as lexicalized, i.e.
providing the definition, usage and literals for it.

6 Building Independent Hungarian
Trees
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999851136363636">
At the outset of the project, wordnet builders de-
cided to follow the expand model, which meant
that HuWN was largely built by simply translat-
ing PWN synsets and taking over its relations.
To test the validity of this decision, we experi-
mented with the merge model and we also built
trees that are truly representative of the structure
of the Hungarian language so as to compare
Hungarian and English trees.
Hence, we decided to build an independent
Hungarian tree from scratch and to examine if
we could find matches in HuWN and PWN.
First, we took a brand of the famous Hungarian
wine called Tokay aszu. The following chart il-
lustrates the newly constructed Hungarian and
the corresponding English tree from the top
down. [mX] denotes synsets that make perfect
matches in the independent Hungarian tree,
HuWn and PWN. At level 8, there are two rele-
vant concepts that are hyponyms of fehérbor.
Tokaji aszú at level 10 is a hyponym of both
aszúbor and tokaji.

Concepts at levels 9-12 cannot be found in
HuWN at all and have no corresponding synsets
in PWN either. The concepts at level 8 have no
corresponding synsets in HuWN, however, des-
szertbor has a lexical and conceptual counterpart
in PWN.
There seems to be a problem regarding the
concept tokaji in the above chart and the synset
Tokay in PWN. Tokaji in Hungarian (and in Eng-
lish language sources as well2) refers to all the
wines produced in the Tokaj district of North-
eastern Hungary. This concept does not seem to
have an equivalent in PWN: it certainly has no
formal equivalent and it cannot be decided what
the definition of the synset Tokay:1 (PWN defi-
nition: Hungarian wine made from Tokay
grapes) refers to exactly. To our mind, it seems
closer in meaning to Tokay aszu, which was
formerly known throughout the English-speaking
world as Tokay (Webster’s 1913). Thus, it seems
that the Hungarian concept, tokaji – which was
not included in HuWN – has no equivalent in
PWN.
Fehérbor (white wine) splits into desszertbor
(dessert wine) and tokaji (Tokaji) at level 8, only
to merge again at tokaji asziu (Tokay (aszu)), at
level 10. Asziubor (botrytized wine) at level 9 is a
non-existent synset in PWN.
The tree was built from scratch but it is quite
evident that – apart from the levels below 7 – it
matches perfectly the Hungarian wordnet: synset
numbers are actual sense numbers found in
HuWN. Ital:1 has two hypernyms, both merging
into the same hypernym at level 2. These facts
suggest that a merge model would also have been
applied in the construction of HuWN.

7 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999958">
Since languages and cultures differ from each
other, there are necessarily concepts that may be
lexicalized in one but not in the other and vice
versa. Non-lexicalized elements reflect either
conceptual or cultural differences between lan-
guages and hence can be used for checking the
similarities among languages. The Hungarian
wordnet – having been constructed according to
the expand model – in its present form contains a
relatively high number of non-lexicalized synsets
but should there be a revision, they might be de-
leted from the tree (either by shortening or flat-
tening the tree), the tree might be restructured, or
they might be lexicalized (if erroneously anno-
tated as non-lex). In this way, the Hungarian
wordnet would really reflect the hierarchy of the
Hungarian language.
Our experiments with building independent
Hungarian trees showed that it would also have
been viable to apply the merge model for word-
net building. Most of the synsets within the trees
can be linked to a corresponding English synset,
thus, interlinguality can also be assured as well.

<bodyText confidence="0.999957449275362">
The results of our experiments also led us to
ask whether it was justifiable to include non-
lexicalized items in PWN. From a purely lexical
point of view, these concepts do not exist in the
language and so may be deleted from the hierar-
chy. The argument that should there be no good
person and bad person synsets in PWN, offender
and lover would be sisters, being the hyponyms
of person (Fellbaum 1998) can be refuted by
stating that this would not cause much difficulty
given that among the children of person, we can
already find synsets denoting positive concepts
(enjoyer), negative concepts (killer) and neutral
concepts (candidate). A second issue concerning
PWN is that although it was intended to model
the human mind, there are concepts that cannot
be found there: see the example of elder and
younger brothers and sisters, which are separate
lexical items in Hungarian, so they denote differ-
ent concepts and if the original plan had been
followed, they should occur in PWN too – at
least as non-lexicalized synsets. A third issue
with PWN is that no distinction is made between
lexicalized and non-lexicalized ones, i.e. no la-
bels like non-lex are used, which somewhat un-
dermines its usage as a dictionary. Although
PWN was intended to reflect the hierarchy of
concepts thought to be universal, it is very often
used as a traditional dictionary of lexical units
and hence it should be the case that lexicalized
and non-lexicalized concepts are distinguished.
In spite of this, we argue that the marking of
non-lex synsets can be profitable as well, espe-
cially in an interlingual context. Researchers
from different fields can exploit the benefits of
non-lex synsets. Psycholinguists might want to
compare the hierarchy of mental concepts of
speakers of different languages – with the help of
non-lex labels since differences are explicitly
marked in wordnets built using the expand meth-
od. Culture-specific non-lex synsets might be
used in ethnographic research. Non-lex synsets
associated with linguistic differences (e.g. nega-
tive prefixes) can contribute to theoretical lin-
guistic research and contrastive linguistics.
Based on the above points, we may conclude
that the usability of wordnets is greatly influ-
enced by the way they were constructed. Word-
nets based on the merge model match the lexical
hierarchy of the given language, so they can be
used as dictionaries as well and they do not in-
clude marked non-lexicalized synsets. Due to the
absence of non-lex synsets, matching them to
other languages is quite difficult and they can be
used for psycholinguistic comparative studies
only in a limited way. Wordnets based on the
expand model – such as HuWN – mainly follow
the conceptual hierarchy defined in PWN, and
contain a lot of non-lexicalized synsets. They can
be used for making interlingual or psycholinguis-
tic comparisons, but they reflect the structure of
the given language to a lesser degree. However,
with the strategies of deleting unnecessary non-
lex synsets and restructuring the tree, it is possi-
ble to eliminate some of the non-lexicalized
items and the wordnet based on the expand mod-
el may gradually converge to the one based on
the merge model, without involving the effort of
building a new wordnet from scratch.

8 Summary
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999978151515151">
In this study, we examined the precise effects of
the expand model on the quality of the Hungari-
an WordNet. We investigated the types of non-
lexicalized synsets and we proposed some strate-
gies – including deleting superfluous synsets and
reorganizing the trees – that may be used to
overcome difficulties concerning non-lexicalized
synsets in wordnets constructed with the expand
method. We also presented an independent Hun-
garian tree – built to reflect Hungarian hierarchy
and concepts – to see whether we could find
matches with HuWN and PWN. It was shown
that the merge model could also have been ap-
plied to Hungarian, and with the help of the
above-mentioned strategies, a wordnet based on
the expand model can be transformed to a word-
net similar to the one constructed with the merge
model, which would reflect the conceptual hier-
archy of Hungarian better. As the way of con-
struction strongly influences the usability of
wordnets, this latter version can be primarily
used in intralingual research that focuses on
Hungarian. Still, marked non-lexicalized ele-
ments could prove useful in different fields of
research such as psycholinguistics, ethnography
and contrastive linguistics. Hence, the originally
published version based on the expand model
can be also utilized in different fields of research.
In the future, we would like to modify the
Hungarian wordnet and by eliminating superflu-
ous non-lexicalized items, we would like to de-
velop a wordnet that really takes into account the
Hungarian way of lexicalizing mental concepts.

For non-lexicalized concepts, artificial nodes may be introduced in wordnets so as to have a better organized structure (Fellbaum, 1998). The original PWN also contains a few such items, e.g. bad person. However, there are wordnets which contain only lexicalized concepts of a language and no non-lexicalized synsets are included. For instance, the Dutch wordnet does not include artificial synsets, producing a much flatter hierarchy (Vossen, 1998). Despite this, the creators of the Basque wordnet tried to include as many non-lexicalized multiword expressions as possible (Agirre et al., 2006). They differentiate between conceptual level imbalances and expression level imbalances, similar to Vossen (1999), who distinguishes cultural gaps and pragmatic gaps. The Basque wordnet, which was also built following the expand model, explicitly codes these non-lexicalized synsets (Pociello et al., 2011). The Hungarian WordNet (HuWN) was developed by the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Department of Informatics of the University of Szeged, and MorphoLogic Ltd. in a 3-year project (Alexin et al., 2006; Miháltz et al., 2008).

It is now the largest lexical database of the English language, and it can be readily adapted to various computational applications. Princeton WordNet 3.0 contains about 155,000 words in approximately 117,000 synsets. Since then, other wordnets have been created and developed for different languages. EuroWordNet is a multilingual project, where synsets for Dutch, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech and Estonian are included in the database (Alonge et al., 1998). The BalkaNet project sought to extend EuroWordNet with lexical databases created for languages of the Balkan Peninsula, namely Bulgarian, Greek, Turkish, Serbian and Romanian (Tufiş, 2004; Tufiş et al., 2004). Other languages for which wordnets have been developed include Arabic, Croatian, Chinese, Danish, Slovene, Polish, Russian, Persian, Hindi, Tulu, Dravidian, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Assamese, Filipino, Gujarati, Nepali (Tanács et al., 2008; Bhattacharyya et al., 2010; Fellbaum and Vossen, 2012). Typically, there are two major approaches to wordnet construction (Vossen, 1998). The first</context>
<context position="4458" citStr="Alonge et al., 1998" startWordPosition="674" endWordPosition="677"> second approach (expand model) starts by selecting a subset of the PWN synsets and then they are transformed into synsets of the target language, preserving relations between synsets. Wordnets created in this way inevitably reflect lexicalization of the given language to a lesser degree; however, it is known that the nodes in PWN form a network, the rendering of which into the given language may be unnatural, forced and this may result in further difficulties concerning multilingual applications (Raffaelli et al., 2008). The merge model was used for most languages in the EuroWordNet project (Alonge et al., 1998), whereas the expand model was used for Spanish, Hungarian and some other languages. Now, languages do not overlap completely: due to the differences in culture, traditions and lifestyle, languages have concepts, words characteristic of the given language alone. They can only have approximate equivalents and cannot be translated using a single word (Derwojedowa et al., 2008), i.e. they cannot be lexicalized. Lexicalization is defined in the following way (Lipka, 1992: 107): “the process by which complex lexemes tend to become a single unit with a specific content, through frequent use. In this</context>

Identical Literals in Hypernymy Relation. The first case of technically non-lexicalized tagging in HuWN is when there are two identical literals in synsets in hypernym relation. This phenomenon is called autohyponimy in Cruse (2000). The developers of HuWN wanted to avoid such redundancies in the trees and, as a convention, they eliminated the overlapping literal from one of the synsets. Due to entailment, a concept can be replaced by its hypernym: if a greyhound barks, then it entails that a dog barks. So it seemed reasonable to apply this axiom in HuWN building, i.e. to not repeat the hypernym in the hyponym synset.

Lexicalization is defined in the following way (Lipka, 1992: 107): “the process by which complex lexemes tend to become a single unit with a specific content, through frequent use. In this process, they lose their nature as a syntagma, or combination, to a greater or lesser extent.” Thus, lexicalization can be regarded as a process that is gradual, similar to the scalar view of productivity (Jackendoff, 2010). Thus, there are lexicalized items in the language, there are non-lexicalized ones and there are borderline cases in between. For non-lexicalized concepts, artificial nodes may be introduced in wordnets so as to have a better organized structure (Fellbaum, 1998). The original PWN also contains a few such items, e.g. bad person. However, there are wordnets which contain only lexicalized concepts of a language and no non-lexicalized synsets are included.

To indicate that such synsets do not exist (at the word level) in the lexicon of the given language, i.e. they have not become lexicalized, the non-lex label was introduced. Now, we will give the criteria for a synset to be nonlexicalized. First, it may be that no such concept exists in the given language (especially due to cultural differences). Second, the concept may be 1 The verbal part of HuWN was constructed in a different way (cf.

Third, the concept may be an umbrella term for several single-word concepts, thus, in the other language it may only be expressed by a list. Fourth, there seemed to be inconsistencies or erroneous definitions and hypernym relations in PWN, which the builders of the Hungarian wordnet did not want to follow and they marked the problematic synset with the non-lex label.

Here, Princeton WordNet 2.0 served as a basis for the construction of HuWN, i.e. the expand model was adhered to. More precisely, synsets belonging to the BalkaNet Concept Set were selected from PWN 2.0 and then translated into Hungarian. These were then manually edited, corrected and extended with other synonyms using the VisDic editor. The set of concepts to be included in HuWN were expanded concentrically later on.

Originally, they were designed to show how linguistic knowledge is organized within the human mind (Miller et al., 1990). Multilinguality is also an important aspect in the creation of wordnets: builders of new wordnets usually map their synsets to those representing the same concept in Princeton WordNet (PWN). However, there is no perfect mapping between two languages at the conceptual level and the lexical level. In this article, we would like to compare the wordnets built for Hungarian and English and we will discuss problems and possible solutions concerning discrepancies in the way the two languages name certain concepts in the context of wordnet-building methods and principles. First, the wordnets we stud</context>

The second approach (expand model) starts by selecting a subset of the PWN synsets and then they are transformed into synsets of the target language, preserving relations between synsets. Wordnets created in this way inevitably reflect lexicalization of the given language to a lesser degree; however, it is known that the nodes in PWN form a network, the rendering of which into the given language may be unnatural, forced and this may result in further difficulties concerning multilingual applications (Raffaelli et al., 2008). The merge model was used for most languages in the EuroWordNet project (Alonge et al., 1998), whereas the expand model was used for Spanish, Hungarian and some other languages.

Princeton WordNet 3.0 contains about 155,000 words in approximately 117,000 synsets. Since then, other wordnets have been created and developed for different languages. EuroWordNet is a multilingual project, where synsets for Dutch, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech and Estonian are included in the database (Alonge et al., 1998). The BalkaNet project sought to extend EuroWordNet with lexical databases created for languages of the Balkan Peninsula, namely Bulgarian, Greek, Turkish, Serbian and Romanian (Tufiş, 2004; Tufiş et al., 2004). Other languages for which wordnets have been developed include Arabic, Croatian, Chinese, Danish, Slovene, Polish, Russian, Persian, Hindi, Tulu, Dravidian, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Assamese, Filipino, Gujarati, Nepali (Tanács et al., 2008; Bhattacharyya et al., 2010; Fellbaum and Vossen, 2012). Typically, there are two major approaches to wordnet construction (Vossen, 1998). The first approach (merge model) starts by constructing a wordnet from scratch (or by using dictionaries and other resources developed for the language) and then the newly created synsets are linked to synsets of anothe</context>

Culturally Determined Concepts. Culturally determined concepts are related to differences in culture, lifestyle or geographical background. Since the American and Hungarian cultures, (folk) traditions and backgrounds are quite different, there are concepts which not always have verbatim equivalents in the other language. In case they have, they may not reflect the feelings and moods they evoke, that is, what comes to a person‘s mind when he hears them may differ in the two cultures (cf. Zidoum, 2008).

Sassenach – a Scot’s term for an English person, where connotations of the original word cannot be mirrored in Hungarian. Culturally determined concepts are called conceptual level imbalances in the Basque wordnet (Pociello et al., 2011). Geographical background mostly determines the named entities included in wordnets.

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999741153846154">
Terminological resources have traditionally focused on terms referring to entities, thereby ignoring other
important concepts (processes, events and properties) in specialized fields of knowledge. Consequently,
large parts of the conceptual structure of these fields are not taken into consideration nor represented. In
this article, we show how terms that refer to processes and events (and, to a lesser extent, properties) can
be characterized using Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) and the methodology developed within the
FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010). More specifically, we applied the framework to a subset of
terms in the field of the environment. Frames are unveiled first by comparing similarities between the
argument structures of terms already recorded in a terminological database and the relationships they
share with other terms. A comparison is also carried out with the lexical units recorded in FrameNet.
Then, relations between frames are defined that allow us to build small conceptual scenarios that are
specific to the field of the environment. These relations are determined on the basis of the set of
relations listed in the FrameNet project. This article reports on the methodology, the frames defined up
to now and two specific conceptual scenarios (Risk_scenario and Managing_waste).

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999909692307692">
Traditionally, terminological resources have been designed as knowledge repositories and until
recently the focus has been placed on finding ways to represent the knowledge conveyed by terms. In
fact, in several terminological applications, terms are viewed as the linguistic components of
knowledge structures (i.e. linguistic labels attached to nodes that represent concepts). This perspective
has led to the design of domain ontologies (or less formal structures) in which concepts are linked via
a network of relations (is-a, part-of, cause-effect, etc) and terms are disambiguated linguistic labels
assigned to these concepts.
However, it has been pointed out that, although interesting, these knowledge structures have
important drawbacks as far as linguistic aspects are concerned: 1. They tend to focus on terms that
denote entities (expressed by nouns) and little consideration is given to processes and events; 2. Other
types of units that could be relevant for terminology, such as predicative terms (that designate
processes, events and properties) are not represented in a way that fully captures their meaning;
3. They either overlook the linguistic properties of terms altogether, or linguistic properties (such as
variation) are taken into account in a peripheral component of the representation.
An increasing number of researchers proposed alternative methods to add linguistic components to
terminological knowledge structures (Faber, 2006, 2012; Montiel et al., 2010, among others). Others
have developed methods to describe terms as linguistic units with frameworks designed for the lexicon
in general. An interesting aspect of this latter work is the consideration given to terms that have been
overlooked in knowledge structures, i.e. predicative terms and more specifically verbs (Condamines
1993; Lerat 2002; L’Homme 1998; Lorente 2002).
It is generally recognized that both the relationship with knowledge and linguistic properties are
important aspects of terminological description, and methods should be developed to merge them into
resources. However, it seems that terminologists still struggle to find an adequate balance between
conceptual and linguistic representations (L’Homme, 2014). One possible solution resides in frames or
frame-like representations that attract the interest of an increasing number of researchers (Dolbey
et al., 2006; Faber, 2006, 2012; Schmidt 2009, among others, see Section 3).

This is the solution we chose in this paper. More specifically, we applied principles based on Frame
Semantics (Fillmore, 1982, 1985; Fillmore and Baker, 2010) and the methodology developed within
the FrameNet project (Fillmore et al., 2003; Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) to linguistic data related to the
field of the environment. A first part of this work was reported in L’Homme et al. (2014), in which
frames were defined based on the contents of a resource containing environment terms (e.g., change,
impact, recycle). In this paper, we summarize our methodology to discover frames, and report on what
has been done to define relations between frames and build conceptual scenarios that represent
processes and events in the field. We then describe two specific scenarios that apply to the field of the
environment (Risk_scenario and Managing_waste).

2 Theoretical assumptions and motivations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9883548">
Processes and events represent an important part of the set of concepts to be represented in many
fields of knowledge. This is the case in environment where events (e.g., “storm”, “melt”, and
“warming”) and processes (e.g., “damage”, “threaten”) can be observed. However, traditional
terminological models (and even less traditional ones, such as ontological representations) are not
properly equipped to describe these concepts and account for their specific linguistic properties,
namely the fact that they require arguments (X changes Y; impact of X on Y).
Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982; Fillmore and Baker, 2010) and its related application FrameNet
(Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) are specifically adapted to account for these concepts and offer different
means to represent their conceptual as well as their linguistic properties. Frame Semantics (FS) is
based on the assumption that the meanings of lexical units (LUs) are constructed in relation to
background knowledge, whose structure can be analyzed in terms of semantic frames. Frames are
conceptual scenarios in which different participants (called frame elements, FEs) appear. For instance,
the Criminal_investigation frame is defined as follows in FrameNet: This frame describes the
process that involves the determination by an authority, the Investigator, of the circumstances
surrounding an Incident by means of inquiry.
The frame states that there are three obligatory participants in this scenario (FEs): Investigator,
Incident, and Suspect (other non-obligatory participants – non-core FEs – are also listed). Lexical
units such as clue.n, inquire.v, inquiry.n, investigate.v, investigation.n evoke this frame. These lexical
units and their participants are also annotated in selected sentences, thus linking the conceptual and
linguistic representations levels of the description, as shown below for the verb investigate:

Frames can share relationships with other frames as shown in Figure 1. Criminal_investigation is a
subframe of Crime_scenario, it is preceded by Committing_crime and precedes Criminal_process.
We believe that frames are well suited to represent the properties of predicative terms: annotations
serve to capture their linguistic properties and link these properties to an abstract representation level,
i.e. the frame. Furthermore, and this is what is explored in this paper, relations between frames, can
help unveil larger conceptual scenarios in which these terms are involved. In FrameNet, some subject-
specific frames can already be found, as shown below (Figure 1) with Crime_scenario and other
related frames.

We assume that this can be applied to the frames of a specialized field such as the environment.
However, we believe that the specialized lexicon will display some characteristics that will result in
the necessity to define specific frames and perhaps specific scenarios. We explore this on a subset of
data that is presented in Section 4.

In addition to projects aiming to describe the general lexicon in English (FrameNet, 2014), and in
other languages, such as German, Japanese, and Spanish (Boas, 2009), an increasing number of
researchers in terminology or related fields suggest that Frame Semantics (FS) or compatible
frameworks are well suited to describe terms.
In Dolbey et al. (2006), Frame Semantics is adapted in order to develop frames in the field of
biomedicine and link these frames to existing ontologies. Another application in medicine can be
found in Wandji et al. (2013) where authors attempt to discover frames in the field with natural
language processing techniques and an external resource (a medical terminology). Schmidt (2009)
introduced some adaptations to the original framework of FS to account for multilingual data (English,
French and German) in the field of soccer. Pimentel (2013) used the framework to establish
equivalence relationships between English and Portuguese verbs in the field of law. L’Homme (2012)
describes an annotation module added to two terminological resources (computing and environment)
that is based on the annotation methodology developed within the FrameNet project. Finally, Faber
(2012) refers to FS in order to account for concepts in the field of the environment and proposes a
general frame (the environment event) to represent the interrelated processes and events observed in
the field. The proposal has led to an approach in terminology called Frame-based terminology.
The work reported in this article bears some similarities with and differs from the work cited above
in the following ways: 1. Contrary to some of this work, frames are discovered after terms are
described rather than postulated prior to the descriptive work (we took a strictly bottom-up approach);
2. Frames are defined by observing similarities between terms (Sections 4.2 and 4.3); 3. Relations
between frames are based on those already defined in FrameNet, but they must be valid from the point
of view of the field of the environment. Hence, some differences are likely to be observed with similar
frames appearing in FrameNet or with frames defined for other fields of knowledge.

principles of Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (Mel’čuk et al., 1995) – contains terms in
English, French, Portuguese and Spanish. Entries provide a description of the lexico-semantic
properties of terms (Figure 2): actantial (i.e. argument) structure, linguistic realizations of actants (i.e.
arguments), and lexical relationships (including paradigmatic relationships and collocations).

environnement), verbs (Eng. erode, pollute; Fr. électrifier, incinérer), adjectives (Eng. anthropogenic,
global; Fr. aride, vert) or adverbs (Eng. globally, locally). In this work, we took into account verbs,
nouns (that refer to events or processes) and a small set of adjectives (e.g., Eng. absorb, concentration,
threatened; Fr. menacé, réchauffer, tri). A subset of 169 English terms and 205 French terms

In the database, several predicative terms (and all those that were selected for this analysis) come with
up to 20 annotated sentences. The annotation is based on the methodology developed within the
FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010). The original objectives of the annotations were twofold:
1. Show how actants (i.e. arguments) stated in the actantial (i.e. argument) structure are realized
linguistically; 2. Supply terminologists writing entries with linguistic evidence to support their
intuitions.
In annotations (Figure 3), the predicative unit appears in capital letters and in bold. Participants are
divided into two different types: actants (in bold) correspond to obligatory participants (roughly
equivalent to FN’s core frame elements); circumstants are non-obligatory participants (that correspond
roughly to non-core FEs). Participants appear in different colors according to their role (Cause,
Patient, etc.). A table summarizes the different patterns found in annotations.
The major challenges for the environment today are climate change, the decline in biodiversity, the
THREAT to our health from pollution, the way in which we use natural resources and the
production of too much waste. [CHANG_1EUROPAENV 0 TK MCLH 19/07/2012]

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998691166666667">
In a previous study (L’Homme et al. 2014), we analyzed data contained in an environment database to
establish whether some lexical units could be associated with frames similar to those that are recorded
in FrameNet or potentially lead to new ones. The methodology for discovering frames consists
basically in: 1. Extracting relevant data from the environment database; and 2. Using FrameNet data
(in English) as a reference to identify a first set of existing frames that the terms in our database could
evoke. A set of tools were devised to help us carry out the analysis.
Identifying similarities between terms encoded in the environment database
The first tool we use is a script that extracts relevant data from the English and French versions of the
environment database and presents it in two separate sortable tables (where the sort function was
programmed to fit specific criteria). These tables are helpful as they bring together, flatten and sort
information that is normally distributed in different entries of the database. Along with the terms and
their part of speech, the following information is presented in additional columns (Figure 4).

In addition to the tables described in Section 4.3.1, another script was written to present a comparison

recorded in FrameNet. Each English entry of the environment database is first searched in the last
release of the FrameNet data (Baker and Hung, 2010) 3 , and presented side by side with the
corresponding lexical units from FrameNet when matches are found (Figure 5). More specifically, the
script retrieves the following information:

have with other frames, and finally the annotated contexts accompanying the LUs themselves.

Differences between FrameNet and environment database
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999887333333333">
When comparing the data extracted from the environment database and FrameNet, we needed to take
into consideration that the two resources bear some theoretical as well as methodological differences.
We summarize them below:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.85887325">
• In FrameNet, FEs are defined at the level of frames while, in environment database, actants (and
circumstants) are stated at the level of LUs. We established that terms in the environment
database could evoke an existing frame if a relationship could be established between the set of
core FEs and the actants, and if the FEs and actants were represented with comparable labels.
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.822889333333333">
2 Lexical relationships are represented in the database with lexical functions (LFs), a system developed in
Explanatory Combinatorial Lexicology (Mel’čuk et al., 1995). In the online version, a natural language
explanation is proposed (Figure 2): this explanation “translates” LFs’ expressiveness in a way that is more
accessible to users.
3 For this, we used the XML files supplied by the FrameNet team. However, we noticed some differences with
the online version of FrameNet: we needed to check whether the information had been updated.
</footnote>
<page confidence="0.991863">
191
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.8994795">
• Secondly, due to the objectives of each resource, the number of core FEs in a frame could differ
in comparison with the number of actants represented for a term in the environment database.
Often, the number of core FEs was higher than the number of actants. In some cases, the
environment database defines a participant as being a circumstant and a correspondence could
be established with FrameNet. In other cases, the specificity of the specialized domain needed
to be taken into consideration.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.860008333333333">
• Thirdly, labels used for most FEs are very specific since they are defined within a frame. In the
environment database, labels are general and defined for the entire set of terms that are included
in the database. In these cases, we generalized some of the labels. For example, labels such as
Entity, Item, Theme, and Undergoer in FrameNet were assumed to correspond to Patient in the
environment database.
• Fourthly, in FrameNet, different labels can account for an FE that would be realized in the same
syntactic function. In the environment database, actants can be split (Agent or Cause for
instance). In both cases, we considered these as being instantiations of the same argument
position.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.971497772727273">
Assigning terms to frames
To make explicit the association of terms to
frames (already recorded in FrameNet or
especially created for the field of the
environment), but also to facilitate the pairwise
comparison of actants with FEs, we created an
auxilary XML file aside from the files used to
encode entries in the database (rather than
adding this information in each terminological
entry). Throughout the analysis, the file was
enriched with additional information such as
definitions and examples specific to the field
of the environment, and relations frames have
with other frames discovered or created (see
Section 4.4).
Once created, the file can be loaded by the
scripts mentioned earlier and used to help the
analysis as it can be passed down to the
comparison of terms and LUs. A comparison
of actants and FEs is shown Figure 6.

4.4 Frames discovered for environment terms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9980705">
In L’Homme et al. (2014), we had analyzed 105 English and 159 French terms. This first set of data
allowed us to find that some LUs were equivalent to frames already recorded in FrameNet; but that
new frames also needed to be defined.
Currently, the different frames defined and the terms that evoke them appear in Table 1. The
difference between English and French simply reflect the fact that more terms have been analyzed in
French and in English up to now.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9814022">
• Entirely compatible: The description of the terms in the environment database and the
frames in FrameNet are similar (the number of actants vs. FEs and their semantic type is
basically the same). For instance, threaten (Agent or Cause ~ Patient) evokes the
Endangering frame (An Agent or Cause is responsible for placing a Valued_entity at
risk).4
</listItem>
<footnote confidence="0.370891666666667">
4 Even if these frames are entirely compatible with those described in FrameNet, some differences are worth
mentioning (in addition to those already taken into consideration when comparing the data, see Section 4.3.3).
First, frames described in the environment database are much more restricted that those appearing in FrameNet

• Alternation: This category was created for cases where the environment database
distinguishes two separate entries for closely related LUs. For instance, predict1a (Method —
Patient) and Predict1b (Agent — Patient with Method) evoke a single frame, i.e. Predicting
(An Agent states or makes known a Patient based on a Method; FN. A Speaker states or
makes known a future Eventuality on the basis of some Evidence).5

• Partly compatible: The description of the terms in the environment database and the
frames described in FrameNet are not exactly the same (the numbers of actants vs. frame
elements differ). For instance, risk has three actants (— of Result on Patient from Cause) and
evokes the Run_risk frame, but the original frame has four core frame elements (Action,
Asset, Bad_outcome, and Protagonist).
• New: Sets of new frames were defined for cases in which no existing frame could be found
or cases where an existing frame was not well adapted for the environment. For instance, a
new frame was created to LUs such as recycle and recycling, i.e. Preparing_for_reuse.
• Pending: Some LUs have been assigned to frames only provisionally for a number of
reasons (few occurrences in the corpus, only one LU in the frame, etc.).

4.5 Identification of relations between frames
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939">
It soon became obvious that some frames defined for the field of the environment were related
conceptually. We determined these relations using as a starting point the set of relations defined in the
FrameNet project: these relations were sought in our data. We assumed that they would be valid – at
least in part – for the domain of the environment, since they had been defined on a substantial amount
of data.
This allowed us to discover conceptual scenarios specific to the field. In Table 2, we first describe
the list of FrameNet relations taken into account and relations that are defined for the purpose of this
project.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.84573">
Relations used to link frames
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953386142857143">
The list of relations based on FrameNet are listed in Table 2.6
and the terms that evoke these frames may correspond to subsenses or microsenses (as defined by Cruse, 2011).
For instance, the Being_at_risk frame in the environment applies only to things such as species, ecosystems,
plants, etc. In addition, the number of terms that evoke a frame is often much lower than those recorded in
FrameNet. For instance, the terms evoking the Being_at_risk frame in the environment data are the following:
sensitivity, threatened, vulnerability, vulnerable (whereas in FrameNet, the list comprises: danger.n, insecure.a,
risk.n, safe.a, safety.n, secure.a, security.n, unsafe.a, vulnerability.n, vulnerable.a).
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.991906666666667">
5 The alternation can be illustrated with the following examples: Even the most sophisticated models cannot
predict the details of how the climate change will unfold; it is also possible that our models will better enable us
to predict the consequences.
6 Here, some differences with the way relations are defined in FrameNet are probably present. This part of the
analysis is based on our interpretation of the way relations are defined in Ruppenhofer et al. (2010), the ones that
appear in FrameNet and our own data.

5 Two scenarios in the field of the environment

In this section, we describe two small conceptual scenarios that were discovered thanks to the
establishment of relations described in Section 4. The first is the Risk_scenario that also appears in
FrameNet. The second one is Managing_waste that has no direct counterpart in FrameNet (even
though some frames appear to correspond to frames recorded in FrameNet). Other scenarios are in the
process of being defined.

The Risk_scenario discovered on the basis of the data extracted from the environment database
appears in Figure 8. We also reproduced the scenario proper to FrameNet in Figure 9 to highlight
some of their differences.
The Risk_scenario in the field of the environment represents the potential threats to the ecosystem
and some of its components. It also shows how the human (although responsible for most of these
threats) takes measures to prevent some of them.
Interestingly, the Risk_scenario unveiled using data taken from an environment corpus and
database shares some similarities, but also some differences with the one appearing in FrameNet. For

The Managing_waste scenario was also defined based on the terms related to residual waste
management. This scenario shows the different processes involved in managing waste and the order in
which they are performed: first
waste is collected, then it is
separated; afterwards, it can be
recovered or discarded. If waste is
removed, it can then undergo
incineration or landfilling. On the
other hand, if waste is recovered, it
is either recycled, composed or

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867">
In this paper, we presented a
methodology to discover alternative
conceptual structures for
terminology. They complement
structures often used to represent
entity concepts (i.e. domain
ontologies) and are well suited to
account for terms denoting
processes, events, and properties.
The methodology, based on
principles borrowed from Frame Semantics and its implementation in FrameNet, was applied to
English and French terms that are related to the field of the environment. It allowed us to unveil
frames that are similar to those recorded in FrameNet, but also new ones that might be specific to the
specialized field we chose to describe. It also allows us to represent small conceptual scenarios.

An increasing number of researchers proposed alternative methods to add linguistic components to terminological knowledge structures (Faber, 2006, 2012; Montiel et al., 2010, among others). Others have developed methods to describe terms as linguistic units with frameworks designed for the lexicon in general. An interesting aspect of this latter work is the consideration given to terms that have been overlooked in knowledge structures, i.e. predicative terms and more specifically verbs (Condamines 1993; Lerat 2002; L’Homme 1998; Lorente 2002). It is generally recognized that both the relationship with knowledge and linguistic properties are important aspects of terminological description, and methods should be developed to merge them into resources. However, it seems that terminologists still struggle to find an adequate balance between conceptual and linguistic representations (L’Homme, 2014). One possible solution resides in frames or frame-like representations that attract the interest of an increasing number of researchers (Dolbey et al., 2006; Faber, 2006, 2012; Schmidt 2009, among others, see Sec</context>

Consequently, large parts of the conceptual structure of these fields are not taken into consideration nor represented. In this article, we show how terms that refer to processes and events (and, to a lesser extent, properties) can be characterized using Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) and the methodology developed within the FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010). More specifically, we applied the framework to a subset of terms in the field of the environment. Frames are unveiled first by comparing similarities between the argument structures of terms already recorded in a terminological database and the relationships they share with other terms. A comparison is also carried out with the lexical units recorded in FrameNet.

In this work, we took into account verbs, nouns (that refer to events or processes) and a small set of adjectives (e.g., Eng. absorb, concentration, threatened; Fr. menacé, réchauffer, tri). A subset of 169 English terms and 205 French terms underwent the analysis described in the following subsections. 4.2 Annotated contexts In the database, several predicative terms (and all those that were selected for this analysis) come with up to 20 annotated sentences. The annotation is based on the methodology developed within the FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010). The original objectives of the annotations were twofold: 1. Show how actants (i.e. arguments) stated in the actantial (i.e. argument) structure are realized linguistically; 2. Supply terminologists writing entries with linguistic evidence to support their intuitions. In annotations (Figure 3), the predicative unit appears in capital letters and in bold. Participants are divided into two different types: actants (in bold) correspond to obligatory participants (roughly equivalent to FN’s core frame elements); circumstants are non-obligatory participants (that correspond roughly to non-core FEs</context>

This part of the analysis is based on our interpretation of the way relations are defined in Ruppenhofer et al. (2010), the ones that appear in FrameNet and our own data. 193 Is causative of This relation was established between the Endangering (with terms such as endanger, threaten) and the Being_at_risk (with terms such as threatened and vulnerable) frames.

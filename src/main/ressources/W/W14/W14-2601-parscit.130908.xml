Abstract of the talk
Beyond literal meaning, words have associations
with sentiment, emotion, colour, and even music.
Identifying such associations is of substantial ben-
efit for information visualization, data sonifica-
tion, and sentiment analysis, which in turn have
applications in commerce, education, art, and
health. I will present methods to generate high-
coverage resources that capture such associations.
I will show how these resources can be used for
analyzing emotions in text, detecting personality
from essays, and generating music from novels.
Finally, I will show how word-sentiment associa-
tion lexicons have helped create the top-ranking
systems in recent SemEval competitions on the
sentiment analysis of social media posts.

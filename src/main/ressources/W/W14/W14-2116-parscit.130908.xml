[In this paper we present a new methodological
approach for the analysis of public discourses
aiming at the semi-automated identification of
arguments by combining methods from discourse
analysis with methods from Natural Language
Processing. Discourses evolve over long periods
of time and, consequently, form a broad data-
base. Up to now, the analysis of discourses is
hitherto performed primarily by hand, i.e., only
small corpora or discourse fragments can be ana-
lyzed. Inevitably, this leads to lengthy and ex-
pensive annotation. Thus, there is a growing in-
terest to overcome these methodological chal-
lenges by the use of computer-based methods
and tools for the semi-automated analysis.
However, there are only few approaches
known that focus on the analysis of discourses
and the (semi-)automated identification of argu-
ments therein (e.g. Reed at al., 2008; Liakata et
al., 2012; Ashley and Walker, 2013). Particular-
ly, approaches that can be explicitly used for the
analysis of German-language discourses exist
only in initial stages. Therefore, we suggest a
fine-grained semi-automated approach based on
multi-level annotation that focuses on linguistic
means as indicators of arguments. The aim is to
identify regularities, respectively, indicators in
the linguistic surface of the discourse (e.g. recur-
ring lexical and typographical characteristics),
which indicate the occurrence of certain argu-
ments (e.g. premise). In this paper, we focus on
the identification of indicators of argument-
conclusion relationship: conclusive connectors or
conclusiva, that are typically adverbs such as
hence, consequently, therefore, thus, because
(Govier, 2013; see example below):
Die Campusbahn werde den Individualverkehr
verdrŠngen, weil die Stadt eng bebaut sei. Schon
in den 1970er Jahren sei deshalb das Aus fŸr die
Stra§enbahn besiegelt worden.
[The campus train will displace the individual
traffic because the city is densely built. There-
fore, the end for the tram was sealed in the
1970s.]
As an application example, a small corpus
consisting of 21 newspaper articles is analyzed.
The corpus belongs to the interdisciplinary pro-
ject Future Mobility (FuMob), which is funded
by the Excellent Initiative of the German federal
and state governments. The methodological ap-
proach consists of three steps, which are per-
formed iteratively: (1) manual discourse-
linguistic argumentation analysis, (2) semi-
automatic Text Mining (PoS-tagging and linguis-
tic multi-level annotation), and (3) data merge.

sis: First, the data is manually analyzed. Objec-
tives of the analysis are (i) identifying discourse-
relevant arguments, (ii) forming argument clas-
ses, and (iii) determining the significance of an
argument in the discourse (Niehr 2004). To de-
termine the significance of an argument the use
by various discourse participants is analyzed and
quantified. The argument-use can be categorized
as argumentative, positively cited, negatively
cited or neutrally cited. In addition, to identify
arguments and their use in public discourse, the
analysis also aims to detect and characterize dis-
course participants who use similar arguments.
For this purpose, the social role, gender or age of
an argument’s author are determined on the basis
of the information given in the text. This allows
comparing the argumentation of different social
groups in public discourses.
(2) Text Mining: Parallel to the manual dis-
course analysis, the collected data is processed
semi-automatically applying the methodology
described in Trevisan (2014/in press). Thereby,
post-processing is performed in four successive
methodological steps. First, the data is tokenized

by means of the TreeTagger tokenizer (Schmid
1995). Second, the tokenized data is PoS-tagged
using TreeTagger. Third, the automatically to-
kenized and tagged data is manually corrected.
Fourth, the corpus is annotated semi-
automatically applying the multi-level annotation
model depicted in Trevisan et al. (2014/in press);
the annotation is performed using the tool Auto-
Annotator. Originally, the model was used for
the enhancement of automatic Sentiment Analy-
sis in German blog comments. The annotation
model consists of different annotation levels with
various purposes and scopes (token vs. sequence
of tokens) of annotation, e.g., the annotation of
the morpho-syntactic function of a token vs. the
annotation of the polarity (positive, negative,
neutral) of a sentence or utterance. Thereby, the
fact is taken into account that each token fulfills
different grammatical functions, which are also
relevant for the constitution of evaluative state-
ments and arguments. The basic idea is, that the
interplay and combination of different annotated
linguistic means constitutes or indicates an ar-
gument and its way of use.

results from (1) and (2) are merged. By the data
merge, it appears, which linguistic means on
which linguistic level interplays or often occurs
with which kind of argument. The results of the
data merge are evaluated regarding the enhance-
ment of automatic argumentation analysis.
The results show that the argument-conclusion
relationship is most often indicated by the con-
junction because followed by since, therefore
and so. In detail, the results show that indicators
for argument-conclusion relationship include not
only causal conjunctions (e.g. because, since),
but also concessive (e.g. although, despite) or
conditional conjunctions (e.g. if ... then). There-
by, the conclusiva indicate either the argument
(e.g. because, since, also) or the conclusions
(e.g. hence, therefore, so). In the second case,
they are still references to arguments that often
occur immediately prior to the conclusion. Fur-
thermore, conclusiva occur predominantly as a
single token. If they occur as a multi-token they
have a reinforcing (e.g. just because) respective-
ly limiting or negating function (e.g. only be-
cause).
The results raise the suspicion that the identi-
fied conclusiva are text type-specific phenome-
non as the analyzed corpus contains only articles
from newspapers. However, we assume that
some of the conclusiva may occur across differ-
ent text types (e.g. because, therefore) whereas
other (e.g. for this reason, in the end) tends to be
text type-specific indicators for argument-
conclusion relationships.
Moreover, having a closer look at the text da-
ta, it is evident that conclusiva only bear evi-
dence of argument-conclusion relationships.
They do not indicate where the argument or con-
clusion starts or ends or in which sequence (ar-
gument-conclusion vs. conclusion-argument)
they occur. Regarding the semi-automated analy-
sis of arguments in discourses this constitutes a
difficulty. One solution to approach this chal-
lenge might be to define the text window, which
has to be considered left and right from the con-
clusiva. In this context, the work of Wellner and
Pustejovsky (2007) has to be considered, too.
Future work will focus on the enhancement of
the methodological approach and its automation,
which includes i.a. the implementation of ap-
proaches such as anaphora resolution or pattern
recognition. Furthermore, the analysis must be
extended to other corpora and text types.

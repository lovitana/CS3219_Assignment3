Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999856111111111">
In the wake of super typhoon Yolanda
(known internationally as Haiyan) in the
Philippines in 2013, many individuals in
the Philippines turned to social media to
express their thoughts and emotions in a
variety of languages. In order to under-
stand and analyze the sentiment of pop-
ulations on the ground, we used a novel
approach of developing a conceptual Lin-
guistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
dictionary comprised of Tagalog words re-
lating to disaster. This work-in-progress
paper documents our process of filtering
and choosing terms and offers suggestions
for validating the dictionary. When results
on how the dictionary was used are avail-
able, we can better assess the process for
creating conceptual LIWC dictionaries.

1 Background

<bodyText confidence="0.999933647058824">
By engaging in a variety of social networking
and blogging activities, individuals often reveal
their “perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and behav-
iors” (Maybury, 2010) through multiple social me-
dia platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. In ad-
dition, social media provides an important source
for breaking news, especially during natural disas-
ters and emergencies (Nagar et al., 2012; Crowe,
2012). During events such as the 2010 earthquake
in Haiti and the 2011 tsunami in Japan, individu-
als turned to social media to report injuries, ask for
assistance, and publish personal accounts (Gao et
al., 2011; Abbasi et al., 2012). Likewise, the 2013
disaster of super typhoon Yolanda (known inter-
nationally as Haiyan) in the Philippines triggered
a wide use of social media during the period of the
storm.

<bodyText confidence="0.99997375">
With its two official languages (English and Fil-
ipino) and dozens of other local languages and di-
alects, the Philippines has a complex and politi-
cized history of multilingualism (Gonzalez, 1998;
Nical et al., 2004; Ang, 1978). Both the gram-
mar and vocabulary of Filipino (also known as
Pilipino) is based primarily from Tagalog, a lan-
guage originating from the regions surrounding
the capital city of Manila, although some schol-
ars argue that Filipino is essentially Tagalog (Ang,
1978; Baumgartner, 1989).
In 2011, the Philippines had the highest per-
centage of active online users in the world (Global
WebIndex, 2011). In 2012, the nation had more
than 10 million active Twitter users, which ranked
it tenth in countries with the most Twitter users
(Abuy, 2012). Tweets from the Philippines are
in mixed languages, with 80% in English and
the other 20% in Filipino languages (Pilkington,
2011). Furthermore, the Philippines is the most
disaster-prone nation in the world (CDRC Admin,
2013; Bankoff, 2002), making it a prime candidate
for analyzing sentiment in social media during and
following a natural disaster.

<bodyText confidence="0.995496384615385">
As social media analysis continues to mature as a
field, if social media is to be leveraged more ef-
fectively for disaster response and relief there is a
need for more quantitative methods to supplement
current qualitative techniques and subject matter
expertise (Servi and Elson, 2012). Servi &amp; El-
son (2012) used the novel approach of combining
mathematical algorithms with a social psychology
tool, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
(Pennebaker et al., 2007), to detect and forecast
emotional trends in Twitter in an unbiased way.
LIWC uses internal “dictionaries” of words

processes, psychological processes, personal con-
cerns, and spoken categories. For instance, one
dictionary under psychological processes is filled
with positive emotion words (e.g., “love,” “nice,”
and “sweet”). Another dictionary under personal
concerns includes death words (e.g., “bury,” “cof-
fin,” “kill”). When a researcher runs a text file
through LIWC, the program compares the words
in the file to the dictionaries and outputs a ratio
of dictionary words to total words (e.g., 1% of all
words are positive emotion words). Researchers
have used LIWC to analyze a variety of texts, most
notably newspaper coverage of a bonfire tragedy at
Texas A&amp;M (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003), one
of the earliest examples of using LIWC to under-
stand emotions around disaster management.
First created in English, LIWC has also been
translated into other languages. This project is de-
veloping a set of LIWC dictionaries in Tagalog
in order to understand social media usage in the
Philippines, particularly usage during the typhoon.
Tagalog was chosen and distinguished from Fil-
ipino for three main reasons: namely, that more
information about and translations in Tagalog are
readily available, to highlight the fact that there
are more Philippine languages beyond “Filipino”
that could be translated as well, and because most
tweets originated from Manila, where Tagalog is
the main Philippine language spoken.

<bodyText confidence="0.999977634920635">
On November 8, 2013, super typhoon Yolanda
made landfall in the central Philippines. Over 11
million people were affected, with 2.5 million peo-
ple in need of food aid and over 2,000 people dead
(BBC News Asia, 2013).
As the Philippines is linguistically diverse, there
remained a need to also explore the tweets that
were posted in mixed languages, primarily Taga-
log since it is one of the major languages in the na-
tion. A LIWC dictionary of disaster-related words
in Tagalog was developed in order to gauge how
many tweets during the period of the typhoon re-
lated to the disaster. To explore the impact of the
typhoon from the publics perspective in social me-
dia, mixed language Twitter posts geographically
restricted to the Philippines were analyzed.
Using a commercially available social search
and analytics too which filters Twitter content
based on variables such as location, time and date,
tweet type (original, retweet, reply), language (al-
though Tagalog is not included) and others, a vol-
ume of approximately 1.5 million tweets from the
Philippines were identified within a two-week date
range around the typhoon. This set was isolated
based on restricting the tweets to those originating
from the Philippines between the dates of Novem-
ber 3-18, 2013 and included any of the following
terms: typhoon, yolanda, haiyan, supertyphoon,
as well as corresponding hashtags.
A wide range of words and concepts relating
to typhoons and disasters, such as baha (storm),
donasyon (donation), nagugutom (starving), patay
(dead), and sagip (save) were identified. Related
terms were also identified and included in the
search, such as #bangon (rise up), a nationalis-
tic call of inspiration; #walangpasok (no entry),
colloquially a school closing alert; Libreng Tawag
(free calls), used to alert users which telecom-
munication companies were allowing no charge
phone calls; and PAGASA (hope), which is also an
acronym for the Philippine weather alert service.
In order to develop a clean data set, these terms
were then narrowed down based on what would
make appropriate inclusions for a LIWC dictio-
nary, resulting in the discarding of hash tags,
multi-word phrases, and proper nouns. Certain
words were also found to be too broad (i.e., false
positives), such as donasyon, which was used
in non-disaster contexts just as frequently as in
typhoon-related tweets within the date range ana-
lyzed. Words like nagugutom and patay were actu-
ally used more frequently in non-disaster contexts
(e.g., “I am starving, I want a sandwich”).
The dictionary was designed to include differ-
ent grammatical forms of words. For example,
for nouns, both baha (flood) and bahang (flood),
where ng is a linking suffix, were included. For
verbs, different tenses were included, e.g., tulong
(help), tumulong (helped), and tumutulong (helps).
In the case of the verbs, other forms of the words
were searched, but not included in the dictionary
if they were not frequently used in tweets. The
complete dictionary is included in the Appendix.

3 Remarks and Future Work

<bodyText confidence="0.999889666666667">
The Tagalog LIWC disaster dictionary was devel-
oped to quickly explore and understand percep-
tions expressed on social media about the typhoon.
While the terms were included for the 2013 ty-
phoon, additional research and validation is re-
quired for generalization for understanding future

natural disasters. While social media can contain
a wealth of information, the processes of filtering
and searching for terms would benefit from a more
rigorous standard of including words in the dictio-
nary. For instance, researchers may want to con-
sider what counts as high frequency for a word,
e.g., if it appears over a certain absolute number of
times or if it appears in high proportion compared
to other words. Overall, a move from qualitative
analysis to more quantitative analysis would clar-
ify the connection between the dictionary and the
source corpus.
The process of creating a conceptual LIWC dic-
tionary should also be vetted against other use
cases and concepts. For instance, the word lin-
dol (earthquake) was included in the dictionary
since earthquakes are common in the Philippines,
although earthquake activity was not recorded dur-
ing the typhoon. The dictionary could be eval-
uated or validated against other social media re-
sponses to other recent disasters, such as the Oc-
tober 2013 earthquake in Bohol, an island near the
typhoon-struck areas, in order to see how users
tweet about disasters.
Geography also plays an important role in how
the disaster dictionary can be used. For the pur-
poses of creating this dictionary, tweets were re-
stricted to the Philippines. It would be worthwhile
to examine if the same words in the dictionary oc-
cur if tweets were collected from different origins,
such as Leyte (the island which sustained most of
the damage) versus Manila (the capital city of the
Philippines) versus a location with a large concen-
tration of Filipino immigrants (such as California,
USA).
Additionally, other concepts related to disas-
ter management should be explored and consid-
ered for inclusion in the dictionary, such as words
relating to property, family, and emotions. As
the original (English-language) LIWC application
already has categories for such concepts, future
work would include translating the complete set of
LIWC dictionaries into Tagalog while also includ-
ing culturally specific words without exact trans-
lations. This work is currently in progress.
Furthermore, the areas hit by the typhoon speak
and use social media in other Philippines lan-
guages in addition to Tagalog (primarily Cebuano
and Waray). It may also be helpful to have dic-
tionaries in other languages predominant in the
area where a disaster occurs. This may be a dif-
ficult task to undertake, as translations for other
Philippine languages are not as readily available
as translations for Tagalog.
This paper details the process for creating the
dictionary; how the dictionary was used in actual
social media datasets concerning the typhoon is
still in progress. Upon reviewing how the disas-
ter dictionary was used, this process of creating
concept LIWC dictionaries and its utility will be
better assessed and validated. Since this tool and
the additional LIWC dictionaries are still in their
preliminary formats, there are no current plans to
make the tools commercially available until they
are reviewed and vetted by native Tagalog speak-
ers. As the work progresses, the disaster dictio-
nary will be maintained and kept up-to-date in or-
der to include additional terms which may apply
to future disasters.

Over 11 million people were affected, with 2.5 million people in need of food aid and over 2,000 people dead (BBC News Asia, 2013). As the Philippines is linguistically diverse, there remained a need to also explore the tweets that were posted in mixed languages, primarily Tagalog since it is one of the major languages in the nation. A LIWC dictionary of disaster-related words in Tagalog was developed in order to gauge how many tweets during the period of the typhoon related to the disaster. To explore the impact of the typhoon from the publics perspective in social media, mixed language Twitter posts geographically restricted to the Philippines were analyzed.

For instance, one dictionary under psychological processes is filled with positive emotion words (e.g., “love,” “nice,” and “sweet”). Another dictionary under personal concerns includes death words (e.g., “bury,” “coffin,” “kill”). When a researcher runs a text file through LIWC, the program compares the words in the file to the dictionaries and outputs a ratio of dictionary words to total words (e.g., 1% of all words are positive emotion words). Researchers have used LIWC to analyze a variety of texts, most notably newspaper coverage of a bonfire tragedy at Texas A&amp;M (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003), one of the earliest examples of using LIWC to understand emotions around disaster management. First created in English, LIWC has also been translated into other languages. This project is developing a set of LIWC dictionaries in Tagalog in order to understand social media usage in the Philippines, particularly usage during the typhoon.

In addition, social media provides an important source for breaking news, especially during natural disasters and emergencies (Nagar et al., 2012; Crowe, 2012). During events such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2011 tsunami in Japan, individuals turned to social media to report injuries, ask for assistance, and publish personal accounts (Gao et al., 2011; Abbasi et al., 2012).

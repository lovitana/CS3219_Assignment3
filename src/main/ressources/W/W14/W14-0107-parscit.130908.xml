Verbal word formation processes involving
prefixes and particles are highly productive in
Germanic languages. The compositional se-
mantics of such prefix and particle verbs re-
quires an in-depth analysis of the interdepend-
ence of their constituent parts for adequately
representing these types of complex verbs in
lexical-semantic networks. The present paper
introduces modeling principles that account
for such language-specific phenomena in the
German wordnet GermaNet (Hamp and Feld-
weg, 1997; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010), con-
sidering the continuum between full semantic
transparency and highly lexicalized meanings
as well as the semantic contribution of the pre-
fix or particle to the meaning of the complex
verb as a whole.

<bodyText confidence="0.793808865384615">
This paper addresses the question how morpho-
logically complex words can be adequately mod-
eled in a wordnet and focuses on two classes of
such verbs in German: (i) prefix verbs such as
entladen ‘unload’ and zerstšren ‘destroy’, and
(ii) particle verbs such as fibergehen ‘bypass
someone’ and losfahren ‘start driving’. Both
types of verbs consist of a word-initial element
followed by a host constituent. In the case of pre-
fix verbs, the word-initial element is a bound
morpheme such as ent- or zer-, while for particle
verbs it is typically a free1 morpheme such as
fiber or los, which can be separated from its host

umfkhren ‘bypass sth.’), which are always unstressed
(Dewell, 2011) in contrast to separable particles (e.g., cim-
fahren ‘run into so.’).
constituent depending on the clause type2 that the
particle verb appears in. The host constituent of a
prefix or particle verb can either be a simplex
(or: base verb) as in the examples above or a
nominal or adjectival base as in bedachen ‘put on
a roof’ or erblassen ‘grow pale’.
A systematic treatment of prefix and particle
verbs in a wordnet setting is desirable and signif-
icant for at least the following reasons:
1. The word formation processes involved
in the two classes of verbs are highly
productive for all Germanic languages.
2. The host constituent of a prefix or parti-
cle verb can be derived from an adjec-
tival or nominal base. Therefore, an ade-
quate treatment of these verbs has to in-
clude suitable morphological and seman-
tic relations among the word classes in-
volved. What makes such an account
particularly interesting in a wordnet set-
ting is the fact that nouns, verbs, and ad-
jectives are the very word classes mod-
eled in a wordnet.
3. The lexical semantics of prefix and par-
ticle verbs crucially involves a continu-
um between full semantic transparency
on the one hand and highly lexicalized
meanings on the other hand. Verbs such
as entladen ‘unload’ and losfahren ‘start
driving’ are fully transparent: Their se-
mantics can be compositionally derived
from the meanings of their parts, as the
preverbs 3 ent- and los contribute the
meanings of removal and initiation of the
actions denoted by the simplex. By con-

2 Free particles are separated in verb-first and verb-second
clauses. They are only inseparable as infinitives or in subor-
dinate clauses in clause-final position (Dewell, 2011).
3 The term preverb is used as cover term for both prefixes
and particles (Booij and Kemenade, 2003; Los et al., 2012).

trast, zerstšren ‘destroy’ and übergehen
‘bypass someone’ are highly lexicalized,
since their base verbs do not make a se-
mantically transparent contribution to the
meaning of the expression as a whole in
present-day language use.
The continuum of semantic transparency and
lexicalization is not restricted to the lexical se-
mantics of German prefix and particle verbs. It
has also been observed with respect to other
word formation processes such as nominal com-
pounding and is, thus, of wider interest. A case in
point is the contrast between Hauswand ‘house
wall’, which is compositionally derived from its
parts, and Bahnhof ‘train station’, which accord-
ing to a simple composition of its constituent
parts should denote a yard for trains, but which
actually refers to a building.
What lexicalized meanings of morphological-
ly complex words have in common is that the
meaning of the complex word is not a hyponym
of the meaning of its host or head constituent:
zerstšren ‘destroy’ is not a hyponym of stšren
‘disturb’ and Bahnhof ‘train station’ is not a hy-
ponym of its head constituent Hof ‘yard’. This
finding also indicates that a simple account that
establishes a hyponymic relation between a par-
ticle or prefix verb and its host constituent will
not provide a satisfactory account of the phe-
nomena in question.
In the remainder of this paper, we will argue
that an adequate account of prefix and particle
verbs has to be based on the following two main
considerations: (i) the distinction between se-
mantic transparency and lexicalization, and (ii)
the way in which the word-initial element con-
tributes to the meaning of the complex verb as a
whole. These considerations will lay the founda-
tion for defining general principles of hypernym
selection for modeling complex verbs in the
German wordnet GermaNet (GN).

2 Prefix and Particle Inventory
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999651115384615">
The inventory of prefixes considered in the pre-
sent study includes all native (Los et al., 2012)
inseparable prefixes in German: be-, ent-, er-,
miss-, ver-, and zer- (Eisenberg, 1998; Fleischer
and Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986; Stiebels, 1996).
Prefixes with a Latinate origin, such as de-, dis-,
re-, or trans- (Fleischer and Barz, 1995), are not
within the scope of this study. In contrast to the
closed set of prefixes, the particle inventory is
more extensive and comprises particles such as
ab, an, auf, aus, bei, durch, ein, los, nach, über,
um, unter, voll, vor, wider, wieder, and zu
(Dewell, 2011; Eisenberg, 1998; Fleischer and
Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986; Stiebels, 1996).
The present analysis makes use of existing
semantic classifications of preverbs (e.g., Augst,
1998; Dewell, 2011; Donalies, 2005; Fleischer
and Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986; Stiebels, 1996)
and develops them further in a wordnet setting.
At the time of writing the paper, GermaNet con-
tains 94273 nouns, 12111 adjectives and 14333
verbs, of which 3040 are prefix verbs and 5171
are particle verbs. Out of the total number of pre-
fix verbs, the frequency distribution is as fol-
lows: ver- (45%), be- (25%), er- (14%), ent-
(11%), zer- (4%), and miss- (1%).

3 Modeling Complex Verbs in GN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972125">
Although it seems natural that the host constitu-
ent of a complex verb could be used as its hyper-
nym, the subsequent analysis of the continuum
between lexicalization and semantic transparency
will demonstrate that this solution is not viable in
all cases. Rather, the continuum requires a dis-
tinction between various classes, which differ in
the selection and in the number of hypernyms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998321">
3.1 Lexicalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960119047619">
Highly lexicalized verbs are at one end of the
continuum between full semantic transparency
and highly lexicalized meanings. Both German
prefix and particle verbs are subject to lexicaliza-
tion. As pointed out in section 1, it is not possible
to assign lexicalized prefix and particle verbs as
hyponyms to their host constituents, since the
semantics of the host constituent is no longer part
of the meaning of the complex verb. As a conse-
quence, this lack of semantic transparency re-
quires finding an appropriate hypernym that
takes account of the meaning of the lexicalized
verb as a whole.
For the majority of lexicalized complex verbs,
the semantic contribution of the word-initial el-
ement is not apparent so that the hypernym selec-
tion is to be conducted in the same way as for
simplex verbs (Vossen, 2002). This is the case
for particle verbs such as aufnehmen ‘record’,
which is modeled as hyponym of the synset
aufzeichnen/mitschneiden ‘record’, as it cannot
be linked to its base verb nehmen ‘take’.
Nevertheless, there are cases in which seman-
tic classifications of the word-initial element can
be used as indicator for choosing an appropriate
hypernym. This mainly applies to lexicalized
complex verbs such as zerstšren ‘destroy’, for
which the meaning of the prefix zer- expresses
‘destroying or damaging something’ (Augst,
1998; Fleischer and Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986).
Thus, the stand-alone transparent semantics ex-
pressed by zer- is used as indicator for finding an
appropriate hypernym (“materielle Zustands-
verŠnderung” ‘material change of state’), as a
relation to the contemporary meaning of the sim-
plex stšren ‘disturb’ is not possible.
Although there is no conceptual relation to the
simplex, the information on the individual word-
internal components of the complex lexicalized
verb is still available in GN in the form of a
morpho-syntactic analysis, which separates the
preverb from its simplex.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999421">
3.2 Semantic Transparency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992004583333333">
In contrast to highly lexicalized verbs, semanti-
cally transparent complex verbs form the oppo-
site end of the continuum. What these transparent
verbs have in common is that there is always ei-
ther a conceptual (i.e., hypernymic/hyponymic)
or lexical (e.g., antonymic) relation to the respec-
tive base verb. However, there are two interrelat-
ed factors that vary along the continuum: (i) the
degree of semantic transparency, and (ii) the se-
mantic contribution of the word-initial element to
the complex verb as a whole. On the basis of the-
se two factors, three different classes can be dis-
tinguished and will be introduced below.
Class 1: Full Transparency, Light Contribution
The meaning of complex verbs within this class
is fully transparent and is always represented by
the respective simplex as the exclusive hyper-
nym. This can be ascribed to the interaction of
the preverb with its base verb: The semantics of
the complex verb can be compositionally derived
from the meaning of its parts. Thus, the simplex
keeps its original meaning while the semantic
contribution of the preverb is light, fulfilling one
of the following two core functions: (a.) indica-
tion of a direction or (b.) intensification of the
meaning denoted by the simplex.
a. Indicator of a Direction
The majority of German particle verbs indicate a
direction. Particles are typically free morphemes
that are frequently used as adpositions or adverbs
without being part of a complex verb (Los et al.,
2012). In combination with a verbal base, they
usually retain the meanings they have in isolation
(Brinton and Closs Traugott, 2005), such as path
expressions (Dewell, 2011). Thereby, they only
add further directional information to the sim-
plex, whose meaning remains highly transparent.
As a consequence, the simplex always serves as
the exclusive hypernym of the respective com-
plex verb. This applies, e.g., to the verb laden
‘load’, which has, inter alia, the following direc-
tional hyponyms in GN: aufladen ‘load up’, ein-
laden ‘load into’, and umladen ‘reload’. These
particle verbs all denote a specific direction by
the particles auf (‘up’, i.e., upward movement),
ein (‘into’, i.e., inward movement), and um (i.e.,
movement from one location to another), sharing
the semantics of the corresponding adposition.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.662982" genericHeader="method">
b. Intensifier
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979092352941177">
The second core function within class 1 refers to
the use of word-initial elements as intensifiers of
the meanings denoted by their host constituents.
The word-initial element only has a light seman-
tic contribution so that the entire complex verb
remains highly transparent and is thus assigned
as hyponym to its simplex. This is, e.g., the case
for verŠrgern ‘annoy’, which has a hyponymic
relation to its simplex Šrgern ‘tease’.
Class 2: Full Transparency/High Contribution
This class represents an exceptional case that is
only valid for a limited number of complex verbs
such as prefix verbs with miss- as negator of the
meaning denoted by the simplex (Fleischer and
Barz, 1995). Consequently, the simplex cannot
function as hypernym, as shown below for the
synset missgšnnen/neiden ‘begrudge’.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.997953">
Figure 1. Conceptual and lexical relations.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.992200888888889">
Instead, another hypernym is chosen that takes
account of the semantics of the complex verb
(i.e., the synset empfinden/fŸhlen ‘feel’). As for
all transparent complex verbs, the relation to the
simplex gšnnen ‘not to begrudge’ is still present
and is indicated by an antonymic relation.
The relation to the simplex can also be implic-
it, as some verbs with ent-, which refer to the
inversion of an action denoted by the base
(Fleischer and Barz, 1995), are antonyms of an-
other complex verb sharing the same simplex.
This is the case for entladen ‘discharge’, whose
antonym is the particle verb aufladen ‘charge’.
Class 3: Low Transparency/High Contribution
The third class displays the highest semantic
contribution of the word-initial element while the
meaning of the complex verb as a whole still re-
mains transparent. Accounting for this predomi-
nant semantics requires treating verbs within this
class both as hyponyms of their base verbs and
of an additional hypernym, which expresses the
prevailing semantic contribution of the preverb.
The two hypernyms thus jointly account for the
semantic contributions of preverb and base verb
and lead to a more precise definition of the verb
classes in question (cf. Bosch et al., 2008). This
is, for instance, the case for one of the meanings
of the prefix ver- ‘make a mistake’ (Mungan,
1986). This meaning is contained, e.g., in the
reflexive prefix verbs represented in Figure 2 as
a selection of hyponyms of both the artificial
concept4 Òfalsch machen/Fehler machen” ‘make
a mistake’ and of each corresponding base verb:
sich versprechen ‘make a slip of the tongue’,
sich verfahren ‘get lost while driving’, and sich
verrechnen ‘miscalculate’.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997695">
Complex verbs in class 3 do not only include
prefix but also particle verbs. Thus, the same ap-
proach can be applied to the verb aufschrauben
‘unscrew’, which has the following two hyper-
nyms: its base verb schrauben ‘screw’ and the
verb šffnen ‘open’.
Another type of word-initial elements, which
can be systematically modeled in class 3, repre-
sents preverbs indicating lexical aspect or Ak-
tionsart ‘manner of action’. On the one hand, this
includes ingressive markers such as the prefix er-
(e.g., erklingen ‘start to sound’) and the particle
los (e.g., loslaufen ‘start running’). On the other
hand, the prefix ver- (e.g., verglühen ‘burn out’)
as well as some word formations with the parti-
cles auf and aus characterize egressive verbs

4 In GermaNet, artificial concepts are not only used for fill-
ing lexical gaps. Similar to the verb classes defined by Lev-
in (1993), they also serve the purpose of classifying seman-
tically related concepts together by means of co-hyponymy.

Stiebels, 1996; Helbig and Buscha, 1987). Both
types of Aktionsart markers are modeled as hy-
ponyms of two verb forms: of their respective
simplex as well as of a verb denoting the particu-
lar aspectual meaning.

3.3 Principles of Hypernym Selection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986175">
The decision tree in Figure 3 summarizes the
principles of hypernym selection, which specify
the number of hypernyms to be chosen (i.e., one
versus two), the synsets to be selected as hyper-
nyms (i.e., simplex or not), and the use of further
relations. Following the decision tree from top to
bottom, it first needs to be determined whether
the complex verb has a verbal, nominal, or adjec-
tival base. If the base is verbal, the left branch of
the tree needs to be passed through, deciding
whether the complex verb is lexicalized or trans-
parent. While lexicalized verbs only have one
hypernym that does not equal the simplex, trans-
parent verbs always have either a conceptual or
(implicit) lexical relation to the simplex and are
distinguished into three classes (cf. section 3.2).
The topmost right branch of the decision tree
considers verbs with a nominal or adjectival
base. As there is consequently no verbal base
that could be used as hypernym for the respective
complex verb, another verb form is to be chosen
that expresses the semantics of the complex verb
as a whole. Thus, the semantic contribution of
the word-initial element is of prime importance
for selecting an adequate hypernym. For in-
stance, the meaning to equip sth. with a/an &lt;base
noun&gt; is expressed by the prefixes be- and ver-
as well as by the particle um. This can be repre-
sented by the synset versehen/ausrüsten/aus-
statten/ausstaffieren. The hyponyms for this syn-
set include the following entries, where the base
noun is indicated in angle brackets: be&lt;dach&gt;en
‘equip sth. with a &lt;roof&gt;’, ver&lt;glas&gt;en ‘enclose
sth. with &lt;glass&gt;’, and um&lt;mantel&gt;n ‘surround
with a &lt;sheath&gt;’. In order to account for the rela-
tion to the host constituent, a new derivational
relation needs to be introduced that creates a
connection to the base noun. This way, it is pos-
sible to tighten the wordnet by establishing rela-
tions that cross the line of word classes.

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999845692307692">
In the case of deadjectival verbs, the meaning
to become/to make &lt;base adjective&gt; is often
denoted by the preverb. An example provides the
artificial concept “materielle ZustandsverŠnder-
ung“ ‘material change of state’, which is used as
hypernym of deadjectival verbs such as verflü-
ssigen ‘liquefy’, verdicken ‘thicken’, or erwŠr-
men ‘warm up’. If applicable, the causative
meaning expressed by these preverbs is explicitly
modeled by the causes5 relation, which refers to
the base adjective being the result of the process
denoted by the complex verb (e.g., &lt;erblassen&gt;
‘grow pale’ causes &lt;blass&gt; ‘pale’).

<bodyText confidence="0.997258297297297">
The use of multiple hypernyms for representing
the compositional semantics of complex verbs
can be identified in the Dutch wordnet project
(Vossen et al., 1999). As in GN, the Dutch com-
plex verb opendraaien ‘open by turning’ has two
hypernyms (Vossen et al., 1999): its simplex
draaien ‘turn’ and the verb openmaken ‘open’.
In contrast, complex verbs in the Princeton
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1999) only make use of one
hypernym: The phrasal verb to blow sth. up is
only a hyponym of the verb expand. The hyper-
nym of its German equivalent aufblasen express-
es the same semantics (i.e., vergrš§ern ‘ex-
pand’), but the particle verb additionally has the
simplex blasen ‘blow’ as second hypernym.
Regarding the different kinds of relations used
in wordnets, Šojat et al. (2012) discuss the inclu-

WordNet (CroWN). These relations e.g. group
the meanings of preverbs into the class location,
which indicates the directions of movements
(e.g., loc_bott_up for upward movement).
Other wordnets dealing with (morpho-) se-
mantic or derivational relations include the
Polish wordnet (Maziarz et al., 2012) and the
Czech wordnet (Bosch et al., 2008). They make
fine-granular distinctions between various rela-
tion types, such as inchoativity and derivationali-
ty, which have also been addressed in this paper.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972588235294">
The present paper has established criteria for
modeling morphologically complex verbs in the
lexical-semantic network GermaNet, focusing on
German prefix and particle verbs and accounting
for their compositional semantics. Two main fac-
tors have been identified that provide the basis
for their representation: (i) the continuum be-
tween full semantic transparency and highly lex-
icalized meanings, and (ii) the semantic contribu-
tion of the word-initial element to the meaning of
the complex verb as a whole.
It has been demonstrated that a compositional
analysis of the word-initial element and its host
constituent enables a rule-based derivation of
general modeling principles, which can systemat-
ically be applied in order to achieve a consistent
depiction of complex verbs in the wordnet.

<abstract confidence="0.997453388888889">Verbal word formation processes involving prefixes and particles are highly productive in Germanic languages. The compositional semantics of such prefix and particle verbs requires an in-depth analysis of the interdependence of their constituent parts for adequately representing these types of complex verbs in lexical-semantic networks. The present paper introduces modeling principles that account for such language-specific phenomena in the wordnet and Feldweg, 1997; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010), considering the continuum between full semantic transparency and highly lexicalized meanings as well as the semantic contribution of the prefix or particle to the meaning of the complex verb as a whole.</abstract>

Class 3: Low Transparency/High Contribution The third class displays the highest semantic contribution of the word-initial element while the meaning of the complex verb as a whole still remains transparent. Accounting for this predominant semantics requires treating verbs within this class both as hyponyms of their base verbs and of an additional hypernym, which expresses the prevailing semantic contribution of the preverb. The two hypernyms thus jointly account for the semantic contributions of preverb and base verb and lead to a more precise definition of the verb classes in question (cf. Bosch et al., 2008). This is, for instance, the case for one of the meanings of the prefix ver- ‘make a mistake’ (Mungan, 1986). This meaning is contained, e.g., in the reflexive prefix verbs represented in Figure 2 as a selection of hyponyms of both the artificial concept4 Òfalsch machen/Fehler machen” ‘make a mistake’ and of each corresponding base verb: sich versprechen ‘make a slip of the tongue’, sich verfahren ‘get lost while driving’, and sich verrechnen ‘miscalculate’.

Both types of verbs consist of a word-initial element followed by a host constituent. In the case of prefix verbs, the word-initial element is a bound morpheme such as ent- or zer-, while for particle verbs it is typically a free1 morpheme such as fiber or los, which can be separated from its host 1 There are also occurrences of inseparable particles (e.g., umfkhren ‘bypass sth.’), which are always unstressed (Dewell, 2011) in contrast to separable particles (e.g., cimfahren ‘run into so.’). constituent depending on the clause type2 that the particle verb appears in. The host constituent of a prefix or particle verb can either be a simplex (or: base verb) as in the examples above or a nominal or adjectival base as in bedachen ‘put on a roof’ or erblassen ‘grow pale’.

Verbs such as entladen ‘unload’ and losfahren ‘start driving’ are fully transparent: Their semantics can be compositionally derived from the meanings of their parts, as the preverbs 3 ent- and los contribute the meanings of removal and initiation of the actions denoted by the simplex. By con2 Free particles are separated in verb-first and verb-second clauses. They are only inseparable as infinitives or in subordinate clauses in clause-final position (Dewell, 2011). 3 The term preverb is used as cover term for both prefixes and particles (Booij and Kemenade, 2003; Los et al., 2012). trast, zerstšren ‘destroy’ and übergehen ‘bypass someone’ are highly lexicalized, since their base verbs do not make a semantically transparent contribution to the meaning of the expression as a whole in present-day language use.

Indicator of a Direction The majority of German particle verbs indicate a direction. Particles are typically free morphemes that are frequently used as adpositions or adverbs without being part of a complex verb (Los et al., 2012). In combination with a verbal base, they usually retain the meanings they have in isolation (Brinton and Closs Traugott, 2005), such as path expressions (Dewell, 2011). Thereby, they only add further directional information to the simplex, whose meaning remains highly transparent. As a consequence, the simplex always serves as the exclusive hypernym of the respective complex verb. This applies, e.g., to the verb laden ‘load’, which has, inter alia, the following directional hyponyms in GN: aufladen ‘load up’, einladen ‘load into’, and umladen ‘reload’. These particle verbs all denote a specific direction by the particles auf (‘up’, i.e., upward movement), ein (‘into’, i.e., inward movement), and um (i.e., movement from one location to another), sharing the </context>

In contrast, complex verbs in the Princeton WordNet (Fellbaum, 1999) only make use of one hypernym: The phrasal verb to blow sth. up is only a hyponym of the verb expand.

Nevertheless, there are cases in which semantic classifications of the word-initial element can be used as indicator for choosing an appropriate hypernym. This mainly applies to lexicalized complex verbs such as zerstšren ‘destroy’, for which the meaning of the prefix zer- expresses ‘destroying or damaging something’ (Augst, 1998; Fleischer and Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986).

The word-initial element only has a light semantic contribution so that the entire complex verb remains highly transparent and is thus assigned as hyponym to its simplex. This is, e.g., the case for verŠrgern ‘annoy’, which has a hyponymic relation to its simplex Šrgern ‘tease’. Class 2: Full Transparency/High Contribution This class represents an exceptional case that is only valid for a limited number of complex verbs such as prefix verbs with miss- as negator of the meaning denoted by the simplex (Fleischer and Barz, 1995). Consequently, the simplex cannot function as hypernym, as shown below for the synset missgšnnen/neiden ‘begrudge’. Figure 1. Conceptual and lexical relations. Instead, another hypernym is chosen that takes account of the semantics of the complex verb (i.e., the synset empfinden/fŸhlen ‘feel’). As for all transparent complex verbs, the relation to the simplex gšnnen ‘not to begrudge’ is still present and is indicated by an antonymic relation. The relation to the simplex can also be implicit, as some verbs with ent-, which refer to the inversion of an action denoted by the base (Fleischer and </context>

These considerations will lay the foundation for defining general principles of hypernym selection for modeling complex verbs in the German wordnet GermaNet (GN). 2 Prefix and Particle Inventory The inventory of prefixes considered in the present study includes all native (Los et al., 2012) inseparable prefixes in German: be-, ent-, er-, miss-, ver-, and zer- (Eisenberg, 1998; Fleischer and Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986; Stiebels, 1996). Prefixes with a Latinate origin, such as de-, dis-, re-, or trans- (Fleischer and Barz, 1995), are not within the scope of this study. In contrast to the closed set of prefixes, the particle inventory is more extensive and comprises particles such as ab, an, auf, aus, bei, durch, ein, los, nach, über, um, unter, voll, vor, wider, wieder, and zu (Dewell, 2011; Eisenberg, 1998; Fleischer and Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986; Stiebels, 1996). The present analysis makes use of existing semantic classifications of preverbs (e.g., Augst, 1998; Dewell, 2011; Donalies, 2005; Fleischer and B</context>

This is the case for particle verbs such as aufnehmen ‘record’, which is modeled as hyponym of the synset aufzeichnen/mitschneiden ‘record’, as it cannot be linked to its base verb nehmen ‘take’. Nevertheless, there are cases in which semantic classifications of the word-initial element can be used as indicator for choosing an appropriate hypernym. This mainly applies to lexicalized complex verbs such as zerstšren ‘destroy’, for which the meaning of the prefix zer- expresses ‘destroying or damaging something’ (Augst, 1998; Fleischer and Barz, 1995; Mungan, 1986). Thus, the stand-alone transparent semantics expressed by zer- is used as indicator for finding an appropriate hypernym (“materielle ZustandsverŠnderung” ‘material change of state’), as a relation to the contemporary meaning of the simplex stšren ‘disturb’ is not possible. Although there is no conceptual relation to the simplex, the information on the individual wordinternal components of the complex lexicalized verb is still available in GN in the form of a morpho-syntactic analysis, which separates the preverb from its simplex. 3.2 Semantic Transparency In contrast to highly lexicalized ver</context>

Accounting for this predominant semantics requires treating verbs within this class both as hyponyms of their base verbs and of an additional hypernym, which expresses the prevailing semantic contribution of the preverb. The two hypernyms thus jointly account for the semantic contributions of preverb and base verb and lead to a more precise definition of the verb classes in question (cf. Bosch et al., 2008). This is, for instance, the case for one of the meanings of the prefix ver- ‘make a mistake’ (Mungan, 1986). This meaning is contained, e.g., in the reflexive prefix verbs represented in Figure 2 as a selection of hyponyms of both the artificial concept4 Òfalsch machen/Fehler machen” ‘make a mistake’ and of each corresponding base verb: sich versprechen ‘make a slip of the tongue’, sich verfahren ‘get lost while driving’, and sich verrechnen ‘miscalculate’.

As a consequence, this lack of semantic transparency requires finding an appropriate hypernym that takes account of the meaning of the lexicalized verb as a whole. For the majority of lexicalized complex verbs, the semantic contribution of the word-initial element is not apparent so that the hypernym selection is to be conducted in the same way as for simplex verbs (Vossen, 2002). This is the case for particle verbs such as aufnehmen ‘record’, which is modeled as hyponym of the synset aufzeichnen/mitschneiden ‘record’, as it cannot be linked to its base verb nehmen ‘take’.

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.998904666666667">
Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in
usage-based models of language, which
characterize linguistic knowledge in terms of
emerging generalizations derived from experience
with language via processes of similarity-based
distributional analysis and analogical reasoning.
Language learning then involves building the right
generalizations, i.e. the recognition and recreation
of the statistical regularities underlying the target
language. Focusing on the domain of relativization,
this study examines to what extent the
generalizations of advanced second language
learners pertaining to the usage of complex
constructions differ from those of experts in
written production. We approach this question
through supervised machine learning employing as
a primary modeling tool random forests with
conditional inference trees as base learners.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999908055555556">
One of the central questions in second (L2)
language learning is how L2 learners construct a
new language system on the basis of only limited
exposure to the target language. While formalist
(generative, syntax-based) approaches have
emphasized the reliance on innate mechanisms
and principles, functionalist (emergentist, usage-
based (UB)) approaches have highlighted
processes of bottom-up induction of grammatical
knowledge from input by way of complex
automatic distributional analyses of perceived
utterances at many grain-sizes (cf. Harrington,
2010 for an overview). The capacity to detect
statistical regularities in the perceived input and
to exploit these for purposes of building up more
abstract generalizations is at work not only in
earlier stages of language acquisition, but
remains throughout life (cf. Farmer, Fine &amp;
Jaeger, 2011), and is operative not only in the
acquisition of L1 but also L2 (see, MacWhinney,
2013 for an overview). Grammatical knowledge
then emerges through iterative categorization, in
which the categories formed by grouping
together similar exemplars at one level form the
input of subsequent categorization processes at
the next higher level of organization. In this
view, language learning involves the task of
identifying those variables that are involved in
defining the generalizations that characterize
conventional language use. In earlier stages of
development, learners are found to establish
generalizations along easily detectable, salient
variables (MacWhinney, 2008). With growing
experience, learners detect additional defining
features and relationships among features and
continue to refine their knowledge, resulting in
their own productions become more and more
target-like.
The resulting knowledge is likely to
comprise both stored exemplars as well as
generalizations derived through processes of
analogical reasoning (see, e.g., Tomasello, 2003;
Daelemans &amp; van den Bosch, 2005; Goldberg,
2006; Ellis &amp; Larsen-Freeman, 2009). At
present, there is no general consensus as to what
form the resulting knowledge takes and to what
extent (if any) human linguistic knowledge is
characterized by representational redundancy (cf.
Wiechmann. Kerz. Snider &amp; Jaeger, 2013 for a
recent overview). Theoretical constructs to
capture the units of linguistic regularity resulting
from such processes of inductive learning
include local associations and memorized chunks
(Ellis, 2002), computational routines (O’Grady,

2005), and constructions (Tomasello, 2003;
Goldberg, 2006; Langacker, 2008). In this paper,
we assume the latter and follow a UB
constructionist approach, in which all linguistic
knowledge is characterized in terms of pairings
of form and meaning, so called constructions. In
this view, language learning concerns the
emergence of symbolic units from the intricate
interplay between “the memories of all the
utterances a learner’s entire history of language
use and the frequency-biased abstraction of
regularities within them” (Ellis and Freeman,
2009:92). The emerging constructional patterns
assume various degrees of abstraction and
internal complexity and range from morphemes,
to words and idiomatic expressions, to partially
schematic (Kay and Fillmore, 1999) to fully
schematic constructional patterns, such as clause-
level argument structure constructions
(Goldberg, 2006). Constructionist accounts are
thus committed to the belief that “[a]n adequate
model of human language processing must allow
for a heterogeneous store of elementary units,
ranging from single words, and basic
combinatory rules, to multiword constructions
with various open slots and complete sentences”
Beekhuizen, Bod &amp; Zuidema (2013:267).
This study investigates knowledge about
patterns at the sentential level, specifically
knowledge about complex constructions
involving relative clauses (henceforth RCs). RCs
have played a pivotal role in the development of
modern psycholinguistic theorizing and a lot of
attention has been devoted to studying their
acquisition and online processing (cf. Sheldon,
1974; Goodluck and Tavakolian, 1982; Diessel,
2004; Rohde, Levy &amp; Kehler, 2011; Levy &amp;
Gibson, 2013; inter alia). In the domain of first
language acquisition, UB constructionist
accounts have portrayed the development of
relative constructions types in terms of clause
expansion, i.e. in terms of gradual
transformations of simple (non-embedded)
sentences into multiple-clause units (cf. Diessel
&amp; Tomasello, 2000; Tomasello, 2003; Diessel,
2004). In the domain of L2 learning, research on
relativization has generally focused on assessing
the degree to which L2 learning reflects the
developmental pathways of L1 learning (Gass,
1979; Doughty, 1991; Abdomanafi &amp; Rezaee,
2012). Largely based on comprehension tasks,
these studies investigated if the learner
proficiency in RCs decreases at lower positions
of the accessibility hierarchy (Keenan and
Comrie, 1977) and/or investigated related
proposals revolving around the internal syntax of
relative clauses (e.g. the Non-Interruption
Hypothesis, Slobin, 1973; the Parallel Function
Hypothesis, Sheldon, 1974, or the Perceptual
Difficulty Hypothesis, Kuno, 1975). This
research has primarily addressed questions
targeted at beginning and/or intermediate stages
of L2 development of RCs. In recent years, there
has been an increased interest in advanced stages
L2 learning and harder to detect aspects of
linguistic knowledge, which has resulted in a
shift towards written production as “[É] in
writing, rather than in speaking, the learner can
[É] better show what he or she is capable of
doing in and with L2 because writing allows far
more reflection and is therefore usually
somewhat more complex linguistically than
speaking” Verspoor, Schmid and Xu (2010:239).
A growing availability of learner corpora of
advanced L2 written productions gave rise to a
number of studies whose main aim was to reveal
factors of “foreign-soundingness even in the
absence of downright errors” (Granger
2004:132). It was shown that - irrespective of
their L1 background - advanced L2 learners face
similar challenges on their way to near-native
proficiency (DeKeyser, 2005; Wiechmann &amp;
Kerz, 2014) in connection with (a) a lack of
register awareness and (b) an incomplete
understanding of the complex probabilistic
regularities underlying optional linguistic
phenomena, which typically includes the
integration of generalizations from various levels
of organization (lexical, structural, discourse-
pragmatic, etc.).
Focusing on advanced L2 learners’ written
productions, the present study sets out to
investigate a complex domain of grammar, viz.
relativization. Specifically, we seek to
understand the conditions in which experts prefer
a reduced, non-finite RC over a more explicit,
finite RC. The examples in (1) to (4) - taken
from our expert data - illustrate the target
structures. The modified nominal in the MC is
referred to as the head of the RC.

We focus on the register of academic writing as
it is characterized by a very condensed style (cf.
Biber and Gray, 2010), which invites the
increased usage of non-finite RCs. Furthermore,
highly specialized domains, such as academic
writing, afford specific register-contingent
constructions (Kerz &amp; Wiechmann, accepted).

<bodyText confidence="0.999972111111111">
To assess to what extent the learners have
successfully captured the regularities underlying
the target system, we fit classification models to
each data set that were geared to discriminate
between finite or non-finite RC constructions
based on the distributional information about the
variables listed in Table 1. If learners have
indeed successfully induced the right
generalizations, then the models should reveal
similar structures for both experts and learners.
As a primary modeling tool, we used a random
forest (RF) technique utilizing conditional
inference trees as base learners (for details, cf.
Hothorn, Hornik, &amp; Zeileis, 2006; Strobl,
Boulesteix, Kneib, Augustin, &amp; Zeileis, 2008;
Strobl, Hothorn, Zeileis, 2009). We focused on
this ensemble method for its ability to (a)
produce reliable estimates of variable importance
in scenarios of correlating predictors (Belsley et
al., 1980) Ð which are the norm rather than the
exception for linguistic choice phenomena like
the one investigated here Ð, (b) for its ability to
avoid biases towards categorical variables that
have more levels, and (c) for their ease of
interpretability. The criterion for stopping of an
individual tree’s growth was based on
multiplicity Bonferroni adjusted p-values from
permutation tests suggested in Strasser &amp; Weber
(1999). Recursion was stopped when a
hypothesis of independence could not be rejected
at α = 0.05. We evaluated the RF model on the
basis of classification accuracy via repeated
random sub-sampling validation (100 iterations;
random split: 70% training data Ð 30% test data)
and compared its performance with a logistic
regression model (GLM) including only main
effects and a support vector machine (SVM) with
an RBF kernel. Average classification accuracy
for the expert data ranged from 69% for the
GLM, to 70% for the RF technique to 72% for
the SVM. The performance of identical models
on the learner data was about 5% higher on
average. To estimate the degree of heterogeneity
of the RC productions that is due to individual
author(s) and L2 learners respectively, we also fit

Figure 2 presents the results of a single
conditional inference tree fit to all available data
points from the expert set. In this model, the
most important variable concerns the animacy of
the head of the RC: in target-like productions,
non-finite variants are more likely to be chosen
when the modified nominal is inanimate (split at
Node 1). Within the set of modifications of
inanimate head nouns (Node 2), RCs non-finite
variants are strongly preferred when the modified
nominal functions as the subject of the
dominating clause (Node 4). Within the subset of
non-subject modifications, the likelihood of an
RC to be non-finite is greater when it is definite
(Node 5). The model asserts additional structure
with reference to the external syntax of the RC
and the presence of an additional modifier to
create a total of eleven partitions before tree
growth is stopped. As individual trees are
susceptible to small changes in the data, which
typically leads to trees exhibiting high degrees of
variability in their predictions, we checked the
structure reported in Figure 2 against the relative
variable importance derived from 500 trees with
three variables randomly sampled as candidates
at each node. Following Strobl, Malley and Tutz
(2009), we considered variables to be non-
important if their importance is negative, zero or
has a small positive value that lies in the same
range as the negative values The RF model

FREQUENT.AC, which was demonstrably
unimportant for the constructional choice. As
shown in Table 2, all effects were statistically
significant at α = 0.05 (no 2-way nor 3-way

variability in the intercept between the texts in
the expert corpus is negligible, suggesting that
the relationships between the variables are rather

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943333333333">
Our results indicated that advanced learners have
clearly not yet built up the generalizations that
characterize expert productions of non-finite RC
constructions: firstly, the learners clearly
underused non-finite variants of RCs relative to
finite ones as evidenced by an observed ratio of
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999702407407408">
finite RC to non-finite RC of roughly 2:1 in
learner language (compared to almost even
proportions in expert language). As learners
typically seek to maximize the transfer of
knowledge from their L1 (MacWhinney, 2013),
we assume that the underuse is at least partly due
to the fact that there is no transferrable
isomorphic translational equivalent to English
nonfinite RCs in their L1 (German). However,
this assessment clearly goes beyond the available
evidence and falls outside the scope of this study.
Secondly, our learners have derived
generalizations that are less complex than those
characterizing expert productions. Thirdly, they
have assigned too much importance to some
generalizations, e.g. the role of additional
modifiers, and too little importance to others, e.g.
animacy of the head noun and the external syntax
of the RC. A linguistic analysis of relative
constructions, which we will sketch only very
briefly here, revealed that all variables to
distinguish non-finite from finite subject
relatives in expert language are semantically
motivated. For example, in expert language non-
finite RCs were strongly preferred in contexts
where the RC modifies an inanimate, definite,
lexical head that is the grammatical subject of the
main clause as in (5).
(5) The logic [used to resolve errors here]
comes from the Cancellation/
Domination Lemma of Prince and
Smolensky (1993:148) [...]
In such contexts the RC is almost invariably non-
restrictive, i.e. its function is not to restrict the set
of possible referents of the nominal, but rather to
attribute a secondary predication to an already
established discourse referent, while the main
predication about that referent is encoded on the
main clause (Wiechmann, 2010). The marginal
adjustments to the intercept in the GLLM fit to
the expert data suggested that the effects of these
variables on the choice of RC are robust in the
target register. In contrast, none of the
constitutive features of this construction
characterized non-finite RCs in learner language.
The variable to distinguish the contrasted
structural realizations of RCs in learner language
most strongly was the presence of an additional
modifier. An RC modifying a nominal that
contains further pre- or post-modification was
more likely to be realized in full finite form.
Closer inspection of the data suggested that this
preference does not reflect a semantic motivation
but rather reflects the tendency of language users
to prefer explicit variants over reduced ones in
contexts of greater complexity (Rohdenburg,
2003). Outside the context of semantically
motivated constructions, expert language
exhibited this preference as well, but its effect on
the structural choice was noticeably less
pronounced. We also found that the variability in
the intercept is not very high suggesting that the
generalizability of our findings is not threatened
by the variability of the subjects’ abilities to
identify relevant generalizations. We found that
about 80% of the learners formed a rather
homogeneous group resulting in marginal
adjustments to the intercept.
On a methodological note, we would like
to briefly address two points: First, our approach
to investigate (missing) generalizations does not
speak to the issue of what exactly are the
productive units in language and how exactly the
operations of combinations are to be conceived
of (for discussion cf. Bod 2009 and references
therein) and does thus not constrain the
computational realization of the statistical
induction processes underlying language learning
(cf. Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002;
Zuidema, 2006; Bod &amp; Smets, 2012; inter alia).
In this paper, we were interested to what extent
advanced L2 learners have succeeded in
identifying generalizations pertaining to
variables that figure in psycholinguistic accounts
of sentence-level processing (e.g. animacy and
definiteness of the head, type of embedding,
etc.). Second, it was not the primary goal of our
modeling to maximize predictive success. We
address this point because we have also fit
models based on much richer descriptions of the
data (20+ variables) and some of these models
reached levels of classification accuracy that
exceeded that of the models reported here.
However, we think that there are still good
reasons to believe that their inclusion is actually
detrimental to our attempts to understand the
dynamics of language learning. To exemplify
this: the variable ‘voice of the RC’ leads to an
about 5% increase in classification accuracy of
the expert model. However, its predictive value
stems from the fact that it incorporates the effects
of theoretically motivated variables thereby
overshadowing their effects. Passive
constructions tend to have inanimate subjects. As
all RCs investigated here are subject relatives,
this entails that the head of a passive RC tends to
be inanimate. We find that &apos;voice of the RC&apos; is
more predictive than animacy of the head, but
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.99833">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999861363636364">
the causal structure of the theory would have it
that head animacy affects voice, rather than the
other way round. With few exceptions, e.g.
Baayen, Hendrix, and Ramscar (2013) on the
reification of distributional effects, this general
issue of predictors being robustly significant

view not received the amount of attention it
deserves. More generally, considerations like
these motivate a shift towards the employment of
causal models (cf. Pearl 2009).

<abstract confidence="0.999558842105263">Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in of language, which characterize linguistic knowledge in terms of emerging generalizations derived from experience with language via processes of similarity-based distributional analysis and analogical reasoning. learning then involves building the generalizations, i.e. the recognition and recreation of the statistical regularities underlying the target language. Focusing on the domain of relativization, this study examines to what extent the generalizations of advanced second language learners pertaining to the usage of complex constructions differ from those of experts in written production. We approach this question through supervised machine learning employing as a primary modeling tool random forests with conditional inference trees as base learners.</abstract>

A growing availability of learner corpora of advanced L2 written productions gave rise to a number of studies whose main aim was to reveal factors of “foreign-soundingness even in the absence of downright errors” (Granger 2004:132). It was shown that - irrespective of their L1 background - advanced L2 learners face similar challenges on their way to near-native proficiency (DeKeyser, 2005; Wiechmann &amp; Kerz, 2014) in connection with (a) a lack of register awareness and (b) an incomplete understanding of the complex probabilistic regularities underlying optional linguistic phenomena, which typically includes the integration of generalizations from various levels of organization (lexical, structural, discoursepragmatic, etc.). Focusing on advanced L2 learners’ written productions, the present study sets out to investigate a complex domain of grammar, viz. relativization.

A growing availability of learner corpora of advanced L2 written productions gave rise to a number of studies whose main aim was to reveal factors of “foreign-soundingness even in the absence of downright errors” (Granger 2004:132). It was shown that - irrespective of their L1 background - advanced L2 learners face similar challenges on their way to near-native proficiency (DeKeyser, 2005; Wiechmann &amp; Kerz, 2014) in connection with (a) a lack of register awareness and (b) an incomplete understanding of the complex probabilistic regularities underlying optional linguistic phenomena, which typically includes the integration of generalizations from various levels of organization (lexical, structural, discoursepragmatic, etc.).

While formalist (generative, syntax-based) approaches have emphasized the reliance on innate mechanisms and principles, functionalist (emergentist, usagebased (UB)) approaches have highlighted processes of bottom-up induction of grammatical knowledge from input by way of complex automatic distributional analyses of perceived utterances at many grain-sizes (cf. Harrington, 2010 for an overview). The capacity to detect statistical regularities in the perceived input and to exploit these for purposes of building up more abstract generalizations is at work not only in earlier stages of language acquisition, but remains throughout life (cf. Farmer, Fine &amp; Jaeger, 2011), and is operative not only in the acquisition of L1 but also L2 (see, MacWhinney, 2013 for an overview). Grammatical knowledge then emerges through iterative categorization, in which the categories formed by grouping together similar exemplars at one level form the input of subsequent categorization proce</context>

On a methodological note, we would like to briefly address two points: First, our approach to investigate (missing) generalizations does not speak to the issue of what exactly are the productive units in language and how exactly the operations of combinations are to be conceived of (for discussion cf. Bod 2009 and references therein) and does thus not constrain the computational realization of the statistical induction processes underlying language learning (cf. Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002; Zuidema, 2006; Bod &amp; Smets, 2012; inter alia). In this paper, we were interested to what extent advanced L2 learners have succeeded in identifying generalizations pertaining to variables that figure in psycholinguistic accounts of sentence-level processing (e.g. animacy and definiteness of the head, type of embedding, etc.). Second, it was not the primary goal of our modeling to maximize predictive success. We address this point because we have also fit models based on much richer descriptions of the data (20+ variables) and some of these models reached levels of classification accuracy that</context>

The capacity to detect statistical regularities in the perceived input and to exploit these for purposes of building up more abstract generalizations is at work not only in earlier stages of language acquisition, but remains throughout life (cf.

Figure 5: Conditional modes for the random effect ID in GLMM fit to learner data 5 Discussion Our results indicated that advanced learners have clearly not yet built up the generalizations that characterize expert productions of non-finite RC constructions: firstly, the learners clearly underused non-finite variants of RCs relative to finite ones as evidenced by an observed ratio of 60 finite RC to non-finite RC of roughly 2:1 in learner language (compared to almost even proportions in expert language). As learners typically seek to maximize the transfer of knowledge from their L1 (MacWhinney, 2013), we assume that the underuse is at least partly due to the fact that there is no transferrable isomorphic translational equivalent to English nonfinite RCs in their L1 (German). However, this assessment clearly goes beyond the available evidence and falls outside the scope of this study. Secondly, our learners have derived generalizations that are less complex than those characterizing expert productions. Thirdly, they have assigned too much importance to some generalizations, e.g. the role of additional modifiers, and too little importance to others, e.g. animacy of the head noun and the ext</context>

The variable to distinguish the contrasted structural realizations of RCs in learner language most strongly was the presence of an additional modifier. An RC modifying a nominal that contains further pre- or post-modification was more likely to be realized in full finite form. Closer inspection of the data suggested that this preference does not reflect a semantic motivation but rather reflects the tendency of language users to prefer explicit variants over reduced ones in contexts of greater complexity (Rohdenburg, 2003). Outside the context of semantically motivated constructions, expert language exhibited this preference as well, but its effect on the structural choice was noticeably less pronounced. We also found that the variability in the intercept is not very high suggesting that the generalizability of our findings is not threatened by the variability of the subjects’ abilities to identify relevant generalizations.

A growing availability of learner corpora of advanced L2 written productions gave rise to a number of studies whose main aim was to reveal factors of “foreign-soundingness even in the absence of downright errors” (Granger 2004:132). It was shown that - irrespective of their L1 background - advanced L2 learners face similar challenges on their way to near-native proficiency (DeKeyser, 2005; Wiechmann &amp; Kerz, 2014) in connection with (a) a lack of register awareness and (b) an incomplete understanding of the complex probabilistic regularities underlying optional linguistic phenomena, which typically includes the integration of generalizations from various levels of organization (lexical, structural, discoursepragmatic, etc.). Focusing on advanced L2 learners’ written productions, the present study sets out to investigate a complex domain of grammar, viz. relativization. Specifically, we seek to understand the conditions in which experts prefer a reduced, non-finite RC over a more explicit, finite RC. Th</context>

Bod 2009 and references therein) and does thus not constrain the computational realization of the statistical induction processes underlying language learning (cf. Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002; Zuidema, 2006; Bod &amp; Smets, 2012; inter alia). In this paper, we were interested to what extent advanced L2 learners have succeeded in identifying generalizations pertaining to variables that figure in psycholinguistic accounts of sentence-level processing (e.g. animacy and definiteness of the head, type of embedding, etc.). Second, it was not the primary goal of our modeling to maximize predictive success.

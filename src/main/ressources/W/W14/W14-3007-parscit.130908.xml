We present a brief history and overview

parsing – the automatic analysis of text us-
ing the theory of frame semantics. We dis-
cuss how the FrameNet lexicon and frame-
annotated datasets have been used by sta-

1 Frame-Semantic Parsing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999971179104478">
Frame-semantic parsing has been considered as
the task of automatically finding semantically
salient targets in text, disambiguating their se-
mantic frame representing an event and scenario
in discourse, and annotating arguments consisting
of words or phrases in text with various frame el-
ements (or roles). The FrameNet lexicon (Baker
et al., 1998), an ontology inspired by the theory
of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982), serves as a
repository of semantic frames and their roles. Fig-
ure 1 depicts a sentence with three evoked frames
for the targets “million”, “created” and “pushed”
with FrameNet frames and roles.
Automatic analysis of text using frame-
semantic structures can be traced back to the pi-
oneering work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). Al-
though their experimental setup relied on a prim-
itive version of FrameNet and only made use
of “exemplars” or example usages of semantic
frames (containing one target per sentence) as op-
posed to a “corpus” of sentences, it resulted in a
flurry of work in the area of automatic semantic
role labeling (M`arquez et al., 2008). However, the
focus of semantic role labeling (SRL) research has
mostly been on PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)
conventions, where verbal targets could evoke a
“sense” frame, which is not shared across targets,
making the frame disambiguation setup different
from the representation in FrameNet. Further-
more, it is fair to say that early research on Prop-
Bank focused primarily on argument structure pre-
diction, and the interaction between frame and ar-
gument structure analysis has mostly been unad-
dressed (M`arquez et al., 2008). There are excep-
tions, where the verb frame has been taken into ac-
count during SRL (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009;
Watanabe et al., 2010). Moreoever, the CoNLL
2008 and 2009 shared tasks also include the verb
and noun frame identification task in their evalua-
tions, although the overall goal was to predict se-
mantic dependencies based on PropBank, and not
full argument spans (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajiˇc
et al., 2009).
The SemEval 2007 shared task (Baker et al.,
2007) attempted to revisit the frame-semantic
analysis task based on FrameNet. It introduced a
larger FrameNet lexicon (version 1.3), and also a
larger corpus with full-text annotations compared
to prior work, with multiple targets annotated per
sentence. The corpus allowed words and phrases
with noun, verb, adjective, adverb, number, deter-
miner, conjunction and preposition syntactic cat-
egories to serve as targets and evoke frames, un-
like any other single dataset; it also allowed targets
from different syntactic categories share frames,
and therefore roles. The repository of semantic
role types was also much richer than PropBank-
style lexicons, numbering in several hundreds.
Most systems participating in the task resorted
to a cascade of classifiers and rule-based modules:
identifying targets (a non-trivial subtask), disam-
biguating frames, identifying potential arguments,
and then labeling them with roles. The system
described by Johansson and Nugues (2007) per-
formed the best in this shared task. Next, we focus
on its performance, and subsequent improvements
made by the research community on this task.

<bodyText confidence="0.999967346153846">
Johansson and Nugues (2007) presented the sys-
tem that resulted in the best F1 score on the Se-
mEval 2007 task of collectively identifying frame-
evoking targets, a disambiguated frame for each
target, and the set of role-labeled arguments for
each frame. The system contained a set of rule-
based heuristics to identify targets followed by a
cascade of three learned models as mentioned in
§1. Das et al. (2010) presented a tool called SE-
MAFOR,1 which improved upon this system with
a similar framework for target identification, but
only used two probabilistic models, one for frame
identification, and one for predicting the argu-
ments. The frame identification subpart involved
a latent-variable log-linear model, which intended
to capture frames for unseen targets, many of
which appeared in the test data. Moreover, the fea-
ture sets in both the models were sufficiently dif-
ferent from prior work, resulting in improvements.
Table 1 shows results on the SemEval 2007 data
for these two systems.
The FrameNet project released more annota-
tions and a larger frame lexicon in 2010; Das et al.
(2014) used this dataset, and presented a variety of
experiments improving upon their prior work, set-

of this updated version of SEMAFOR involved
handling unseen targets using a graph-based semi-
supervised learning approach and improved infer-
ence using a dual decomposition algorithm. Sub-
sequently, Hermann et al. (2014) used a very simi-
lar framework but presented a novel method using
distributed word representations for better frame
identification, outperforming the aforementioned
update to SEMAFOR. Table 1 shows the perfor-
mance in terms of F1 score for frames and ar-
guments given gold targets. Recent work on the
FrameNet corpora, including the aforementioned
two papers have used gold targets to measure the
performance of statistical methods because the
distribution of annotated targets in the data varied
significantly across documents and domains, mak-
ing it difficult to build a learnable system for target
identification.
The aforementioned papers focused on the
task of sentence-internal frame-semantic analysis.
There have been some investigation of finding im-
plicit arguments of frames that may be present in
other parts of a document, outside the sentential
context. Although there has not been extensive
research on this topic, a shared task at SemEval
2010 focused on this problem (Ruppenhofer et al.,
2010).2 Moreover, there has been significant effort

3 Applications
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999793625">
Shallow semantic analysis based on FrameNet
data has been recently utilized across various nat-
ural language processing applications with suc-
cess. These include the generation of meeting
summaries (Kleinbauer, 2012), the prediction of
stock price movement using (Xie et al., 2013), in-
ducing slots for domain-specific dialog systems
(Chen et al., 2013), stance classification in debates
(Hasan and Ng, 2013), modeling the clarity of stu-
dent essays (Persing and Ng, 2013) to name a few.
There is strong potential in using frame-
semantic structures in other applications such as
question answering and machine translation, as
demonstrated by prior work using PropBank-style
SRL annotations (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Liu and
Gildea, 2010).

4 Future Directions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99747054">
Given the wide body of work in frame-semantic
analysis of text, and recent interest in using frame-
semantic parsers in NLP applications, the future
directions of research look exciting.
First and foremost, to improve the quality of au-
tomatic frame-semantic parsers, the coverage of
the FrameNet lexicon on free English text, and the
number of annotated targets needs to increase. For
example, the training dataset used for the state-of-
the-art system of Hermann et al. (2014) contains
only 4,458 labeled targets, which is approximately
40 times less than the number of annotated targets
in Ontonotes 4.0 (Hovy et al., 2006), a standard
NLP dataset, containing PropBank-style verb an-
notations. This comparison is important because
FrameNet covers many more syntactic categories
than the PropBank-style annotations, and features
more than 1,000 semantic role labels compared to
51 in Ontonotes, but severely lacks annotations. A
machine learned system would find it very hard
to generalize to new data given such data sparsity.
Increasing the quantity of such annotations re-
quires exhaustive inter-annotator agreement stud-
ies (which has been rare in FrameNet corpora gen-
eration) and the development of annotation guide-
nominal targets in NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) has been
investigated recently (Gerber and Chai, 2012).
lines, such that these annotations can be produced
outside the FrameNet project.
Other than increasing the amount of labeled
data, there is a necessity of automatically aligning
predicate-level semantic knowledge present in re-
sources like FrameNet, PropBank, NomBank and
VerbNet (Schuler, 2005). These lexicons share a
lot of knowledge about predicates and current re-
sources like Ontonotes do align some of the infor-
mation, but a lot remains missing. For example,
alignment between these lexicons could be done
within a statistical model for frame-semantic pars-
ing, such that correlations between the coarse se-
mantic role labels in PropBank or NomBank and
the finer labels in FrameNet could be discovered
automatically.
Finally, the FrameNet data is an attractive test
bed for semi-supervised learning techniques be-
cause of data sparsity; distributed word represen-
tations, which often capture more semantic infor-
mation than surface-form features could be ex-
ploited in various aspects of the frame-semantic
parsing task.

Finally, the FrameNet data is an attractive test bed for semi-supervised learning techniques because of data sparsity; distributed word representations, which often capture more semantic information than surface-form features could be exploited in various aspects of the frame-semantic parsing task.

We also focus on future directions in frame-semantic parsing research, and discuss NLP applications that could benefit from this line of work. 1 Frame-Semantic Parsing Frame-semantic parsing has been considered as the task of automatically finding semantically salient targets in text, disambiguating their semantic frame representing an event and scenario in discourse, and annotating arguments consisting of words or phrases in text with various frame elements (or roles). The FrameNet lexicon (Baker et al., 1998), an ontology inspired by the theory of frame semantics (Fillmore, 1982), serves as a repository of semantic frames and their roles. Figure 1 depicts a sentence with three evoked frames for the targets “million”, “created” and “pushed” with FrameNet frames and roles.

There are exceptions, where the verb frame has been taken into account during SRL (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009; Watanabe et al., 2010). Moreoever, the CoNLL 2008 and 2009 shared tasks also include the verb and noun frame identification task in their evaluations, although the overall goal was to predict semantic dependencies based on PropBank, and not full argument spans (Surdeanu et al., 2008; Hajiˇc et al., 2009). The SemEval 2007 shared task (Baker et al., 2007) attempted to revisit the frame-semantic analysis task based on FrameNet. It introduced a larger FrameNet lexicon (version 1.3), and also a larger corpus with full-text annotations compared to prior work, with multiple targets annotated per sentence. The corpus allowed words and phrases with noun, verb, adjective, adverb, number, determiner, conjunction and preposition syntactic categories to serve as targets and evoke frames, unlike any other single dataset; it also allowed targets from different syntactic categories share frames, and therefore roles.

Increasing the quantity of such annotations requires exhaustive inter-annotator agreement studies (which has been rare in FrameNet corpora generation) and the development of annotation guidenominal targets in NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) has been investigated recently (Gerber and Chai, 2012). lines, such that these annotations can be produced outside the FrameNet project.

The repository of semantic role types was also much richer than PropBankstyle lexicons, numbering in several hundreds. Most systems participating in the task resorted to a cascade of classifiers and rule-based modules: identifying targets (a non-trivial subtask), disambiguating frames, identifying potential arguments, and then labeling them with roles. The system described by Johansson and Nugues (2007) performed the best in this shared task. Next, we focus on its performance, and subsequent improvements made by the research community on this task. 26 Proceedings of Frame Semantics in NLP: A Workshop in Honor of Chuck Fillmore (1929–2014), pages 26–29, Baltimore, Maryland USA, June 27, 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics Figure 1: A partial depiction of frame-semantic structures taken from Das et al.

Automatic analysis of text using framesemantic structures can be traced back to the pioneering work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). Although their experimental setup relied on a primitive version of FrameNet and only made use of “exemplars” or example usages of semantic frames (containing one target per sentence) as opposed to a “corpus” of sentences, it resulted in a flurry of work in the area of automatic semantic role labeling (M`arquez et al., 2008).

There is strong potential in using framesemantic structures in other applications such as question answering and machine translation, as demonstrated by prior work using PropBank-style SRL annotations (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Liu and Gildea, 2010). 4 Future Directions Given the wide body of work in frame-semantic analysis of text, and recent interest in using framesemantic parsers in NLP appli</context>

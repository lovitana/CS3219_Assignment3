<bodyText confidence="0.998611625">
This paper looks at the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources in primary school edu-
cation in Ireland. It shows how two Irish NLP resources, the Irish Finite State Transducer Mor-
phological Engine (IFSTME) (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002) and Gramadóir (Scannell, 2005) were used
as the underlying engines for two Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) resources for
Irish. The IFSTME was used to supply verb conjugation information for a Verb Checker Component
of a CALL resource, while Gramadóir was the underlying engine for a Writing Checker Component.
The paper outlines the motivation behind the development of these resources which include trying to
leverage some of the benefits of CALL for students studying Irish in primary school. In order to de-
velop CALL materials that were not just an electronic form of a textbook, it was considered impor-
tant to incorporate existing NLP resources into the CALL materials. This would have the benefit of
not re-inventing the wheel and of using tools that had been designed and testing by a knowledgeable
NLP researcher, rather than starting from scratch. The paper reports on the successful development
of the CALL resources and some positive feedback from students and teachers. There are several
non-technical reasons, mainly logistical, which hinder the deployment of Irish CALL resources in
schools, but Irish NLP researchers should strive to disseminate their research and findings to a wider
audience than usual, if they wish others to benefit from their work.

This paper looks at how Irish NLP resources can be used in the development of Computer Assisted
Language Learning (CALL) resources. It reports on the motivation for using CALL and specifically
NLP/CALL in the primary school context in Ireland. Irish is a compulsory subject in primary schools
in Ireland and most students spend 13 years studying the language (Murtagh, 2003), but it is not a par-
ticularly popular subject (6 Riagáin and 6 Glíasáin, 1994, DCRGA, 2009) . CALL has many poten-
tial benefits for the language learner and it is important the students learning Irish have access to reli-
able, good quality CALL resources. However, it is difficult to develop such CALL resources, as usu-
ally a multi-disciplinary team is required, and such a team is often hard to assemble. One approach is
to try to adapt and reuse existing resources to speed up the development process and indeed, provide
resources that might not otherwise exist.
With this in mind, two existing NLP resources for Irish were used to develop CALL resources for
students in the primary school context. The use of the resources is not limited to primary school stu-
dents, but they were developed with these students as the target learning group. The first tool that was
used was the Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002). It was used
to provide verb conjugation information for the Verb Conjugation Component (VCC) of the CALL
resources. The aim of the VCC was to provide static and dynamic web pages with verb conjugation
information and exercises/language games for the learner. The second tool used was Gramadóir
(Scannell, 2005). It is a grammar checking tool and provided the underlying engine for the Writing
Checker Component for the CALL resources. A wrapper was placed around Gramadóir in order to
adapt it for the target learners. This included modifying the errors messages to be more young-learner
friendly and separating spelling and grammar errors. CALL resources were developed using these

Irish NLP resources and deployed in two primary schools in Ireland. The students were able to use the
resources without any major difficulties, but long term use depends on factors other than the
NLP/CALL integration ones. However, in order to make use of the NLP resources that are currently
available to CALL developers, it behoves NLP researchers to make their research widely available and
comprehensible to a non-NLP knowledgeable audience. Of course, CALL researchers should also try
to interact with the NLP community for a fruitful exchange of ideas and knowledge.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797125">
Irish used to be the lingua franca in Ireland many centuries ago, but this is no longer the case. How-
ever, the vast majority of school students in Ireland study Irish for 13 years (Murtagh, 2003) in both
primary and secondary school. There are several challenges to the teaching of Irish, including attitude,
potential pedagogical difficulties and lack of suitable resources (including computer-based resources).
This section looks at the place of Irish in the primary school system in Ireland, the problem of lack of
suitable, high-quality, reliable resources for Irish for learners in general and especially for primary
school children. It also looks at the role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer As-
sisted Language Learning (CALL) in the teaching and learning of Irish.

2.1 Irish
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999955166666667">
Irish is a morphologically-rich language that was the lingua-franca of the majority of people in Ireland
until around the 17th century. Its use started to decline around this time and today there are approxi-
mately 20,000 active speakers (Ó hÉallaithe, 2004). Irish has had a complex, paradoxical socio-
cultural role in Ireland. On the one hand, people in Ireland appreciate the importance of having a na-
tional language that is distinct to Ireland and understand its cultural role (DCRGA, 2009). However,
they are somewhat ambivalent about its role in the education system.

2.2 Education
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991266666667">
There are several pedagogical issues with the teaching of Irish in schools in Ireland. It is one of the
core subjects and is taught on a daily basis. Often there is a lack of interest on the part of the students
and their parents. Reasons such as ‘it’s a useless language, no one speaks it anymore’, or ‘why don’t
they teach French/Chinese instead?’ are sometimes heard. Some students find it difficult. Eleven of
the most commonly used verbs are highly irregular, which can be daunting and confusing for young
learners. There is also the issue with lack of resources. Obviously, there is no large international
market for Irish language primary school text books and publishers only have the internal market in
Ireland. This limits the financial incentive for publishers to provide materials for students. In many
primary schools, students have to pay for their own books, with some schools operating book rental
schemes. This means that for any schools there is little or no incentive to change the books series that
they use for teaching Irish. Furthermore, given the non-positive attitude some parents have towards
the time/effort devoted to teaching and learning Irish in primary school, they are often not receptive to
moving to a different book series if they do not have the option to buy pre-owned books for older chil-
dren in the school. Harris and Murtagh (1999) and Hickey and Stenson (2010) provide a good over-
view of the Irish education field.

2.3 Lack of Suitable Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999603714285714">
One possible strategy to incorporate a more modern approach is to use electronic resources. However,
many of the resources available are not particularly suitable for primary schools students, as they are
aimed at adults or may not be very accurate. Adults may be able to comprehend that the information
that they see online may not be totally correct, but primary school students are not accustomed to this,
as they expect the information to be correct all the time. For example, an adult may understand that
“The President has super powers” or “London is the capital of Ireland” may not be true, but a child
may just accept it as fact.

2.4 NLP, Computer Assisted Language Learning and Irish
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999941634146342">
Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) can help in the language learning process. It can help
with learner motivation (e.g. Murphy and Hurd, 2011) and provide a degree of privacy for students. It
enables students to repeat exercises and revise as often as they like – the computer will not tire of pro-
viding feedback to students (unlike, perhaps, a teacher in a classroom setting). Students can work at
their own pace when using CALL resources – something which can be helpful in a mixed-ability class.
CALL can be useful when there is limited or no access to a teacher e.g. in a minority or endangered
language scenario. CALL can perhaps enhance the prestige of a minority language, by demonstrating
that the language as an electronic and/or online presence. All these potential benefits can accrue to
CALL for Irish. The problem is that there are several issues which hinder the development and de-
ployment of CALL resources for Irish. From a CALL resource development point of view, the teach-
ers may not have the time, knowledge or the expertise to develop CALL materials. There may not be
the computing resources for the students to have access to the CALL materials. These factors pertain
for Irish in the primary school context. The teachers cover all primary school subjects and, in general,
are not trained linguists or Irish language specialists. Furthermore, while they may have reasonable
computing skill, they may not have the skills and knowledge necessary required to develop Irish
CALL materials. In many primary schools in Ireland, there may not be a computer in the classroom
and so the students have to use a computer lab. Often, the computers are relatively old and are of a low
specification, and the students have limited access to the lab. In their weekly computer slot, the
teacher has to decide to use the time for English, mathematics or other school subjects.
Many CALL resources do not use any NLP e.g. the BBC Languages (World Service English) (BBC,
2014) is a general CALL resource for English language learners. Intelligent CALL (ICALL) mainly
draws on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (Matthews,
1993). NLP technologies can be used in CALL resources for concordancing, morphological process-
ing and syntactic processing (Nerbonne, 2003). There are many reasons why NLP technologies are
not widely used in CALL. NLP is inherently difficult and there are difficulties in integrating NLP in
CALL resources. NLP researchers and NLP research is not CALL-based and there are difficulties in
visualising how NLP can be used in CALL resources. Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge
amongst CALL practitioners about NLP, as the use of NLP in CALL has been driven by NLP special-
ists rather than CALL practitioners. Another difficulty is that NLP tools and techniques are often de-
signed to work with correct input (Vandeventer Faltin, 2003) and language learners produce incorrect
input. Also, some NLP CALL projects concentrate on the functionality/content and neglect the User
Interface (UI) and this makes it difficult for the non-expert user to use the resources. However, there
is a growing interest in NLP resources for language learners, particularly in the area of error detection
(Leacock et al., 2014). There have been some successful NLP CALL programs (e.g. ALICE-chan
(Levin and Evans, 1995)), but there are not many good examples that demonstrate the ability of NLP
in CALL. Many NLP/CALL projects finish at the prototype stage and progress no further. The issue
of using NLP in CALL without a good pedagogical basis must also be noted. There are also some
socio-cultural factors that must also be considered including the attitudes of teachers, learners and
NLP researchers to the NLP/CALL field. There are very few NLP resources available for Irish.
However, two of these resources, the IFSTE and Gramadóir, are robust and informative and can be
used in CALL resources for Irish and these are discussed below.

3.1 Approach

<bodyText confidence="0.999927">
As outlined above, there is a problem with the lack of suitable, high quality CALL resources for Irish.
One potential solution to this problem is to use existing NLP resources for Irish in CALL resources for
the language. There are not too many such resources available for Irish, but two very useful resources
are Gramadóir (Scannell, 2005) and the Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (Uí Dhon-
nchadha, 2002) (henceforth, IFSTME). These are both high-quality, reliable and accurate resources
that are publicly available. These resources were integrated into two Irish CALL resources for pri-
mary school children. Gramadóir was used in a Writing Checker Component (WCC) and the IF-
STME was used in a Verb Conjugation Component (VCC). The overall architecture ran on an Apache

directory. XML technologies and Perl were core components of the CALL software.

3.2 Verb Conjugation Component

<bodyText confidence="0.9999674">
Uí Dhonnchadh’s (2002) Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (IFSTME) is a comprehen-
sive resource which supplies morphological information for Irish words and sentences. The IFSTME
was used to generate the verb conjugations for verbs in the past simple tense.
The aim of the Verb Conjugation Component (VCC) is to provide a tool to produce static and ani-
mated verb conjugation web pages based on externally supplied verb data. The underlying engine is
an Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (IFSTME) (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002). It was
combined with an animation tool (Koller, 2004) and a CALL Template (Ward, 2001) to provide an
Irish verb learning tool for primary school students. Figure 1 shows the information flow for the VCC.
The external source of verb information (i.e. the IFSTME) provides information on verbs to the VCC
which uses the information in the CALL resources.

The IFSTME provides an analyser and generator for Irish inflectional morphology for nouns, adjec-
tives and verbs. Replace rule triggers (for stems and affixes) are combined with replace rules written
as regular expressions (for word mutations) to produce a two-level morphological transducer for Irish.
The VCC only uses a very small subset of the verb forms provided by the IME (there are 52 forms in
all). It has web pages for 20 verbs, in both static and dynamic forms. Figure 3 shows the past indica-
tive information for bris (to break) supplied by the Irish Finite State Morphology Engine (Uí Dhon-

3.3 Writing Checker Component
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999896225806452">
The Writing Checker Component (WCC) provides a tool that checks the learner’s text input and pro-
vides feedback on spelling and grammar errors. It adapts an externally supplied grammar checker,
Gramadóir (Scannell, 2005) to the needs of primary school students. Gramadóir is an open source
grammar checker that has been implemented for Irish and it can be used on a variety of operating sys-
tems. It is modular in design and provides separate components for sentence segmentation, spell
checking, part-of-speech tagging and grammar checking. It is easy to use and there is a simple com-
mand line interface and a web interface to the software. It is corpus-based and is booted from web-
based corpora. It is easy to port to other languages as the language developers’ pack provided is de-
signed so that no programming experience is required. It is scalable. Spell checking packages can be
developed in a few hours, while the engine also accommodates the development of a full-scale gram-
mar checker.
Gramadóir is an excellent, accurate Irish language resource. It is aimed at linguistically-aware
adults. It can be used in white-box mode and be adapted to the needs of the users. However, a black-
box approach was taken when developing a writing checker for primary school students. Under this
approach, the grammar error messages to the user were passed through a filter and substituted with
more suitable error messages for the target learners.
There was an initial pilot study to test the feasibility of the resources and there were several design
modifications based on learner and teacher feedback. For example, there was a need to convert the
adult learner-oriented language of Gramadóir’s errors messages to language more appropriate to
younger learners. Some of the original Gramadóir’s error messages and their WCC equivalent are
shown in Table 1. Note that not all students would understand the words &amp;quot;urú&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;séimhiú&amp;quot; even
thought the teacher may have explained them.
There was a need to separate out spelling errors from grammar errors and an error classification file
was used to classify Gramadóir’s errors as either grammar or spelling errors. Sometimes, Gramadóir
failed to suggest any alternatives for spelling errors and the Levenshtein algorithm (implemented with
code from Merriampark (2005)) was used to check suitable words from the local dictionary. The local
dictionary consisted of words from the some class texts. A word with a Levenshtien value of 1 was
probably the word the student intended to use, while those with a value of 2 were probably suitable.
There was also a need to be able to correct and resubmit a text. The screen layout had to be changed
so that more information could be viewed at once and to minimise scrolling. A review of the errors
detected and not detected by Gramdóir was required and certain adaptations were necessary.

The VCC and the WCC were used by primary schools students in two English-medium schools in Ire-
land. One of the schools was a mainstream, standard school (School 1) and the other was a school in a
disadvantaged area (School 2). Ethical approval was applied for and obtained from the University’s
Research Ethics Committee and the parents. 3rd (age 8 – 9) and 4th class students (age 9 - 10) from
School 1 used the VCC and 4th class students from School 2 used the WCC. The students used the
resources over a period of several months on an ad-hoc basis.

4.2 Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997117647059">
Evaluation in the CALL field is complex. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation and formative and
summative evaluation are all important. The VCC and WCC were evaluated using several different
criteria. The aim of using various different evaluation criteria was to try to evaluate the Irish CALL
resources from different perspectives. Chapelle’s (2001) and Colpaert’s (2004) CALL evaluation cri-
teria were used to evaluate the VCC and WCC as CALL artefacts. The ICT4LT (2005) website which
provides a CALL software evaluation checklist, was also used. The limitations of the evaluations in-
clude that some of it is based on self-reporting by young learners and that it was a small scale study
with irregular and uneven usage.
The VCC was evaluated by the teacher and students in the mainstream school. An anonymous
questionnaire-based survey was completed by 20 students (6 students were missing on the day of the
questionnaire). There were both open and closed questions and students were encouraged to provide
(negative) feedback. With regards to the VCC, the students 40% liked the tool, 45% liked it a little
and only 15% did not like it. The majority found it helpful (45%) or a little helpful (35%), with only
20% saying it was not helpful. The majority preferred the animate mode (60%), over the static mode
(15%), with 10% slightly preferring the animated mode, while 15% did not see the animated pages.
The teacher found the resource useful as it was aligned with her teaching objectives for the class. Ta-
ble 4 shows a summary of the student feedback on the VCC.

The teacher also provided an evaluation of the VCC. She said that it had sufficient learning poten-
tial because it focused on verb conjugation forms and her students did well in the verb exercises. She
thought it was suitable for the learners, it was sufficiently challenging for them, it had the right level of
difficulty and that the tasks were appropriate for them. The teacher said that explicit exposure to verb
conjugation forms was pedagogically appropriate for her students. Note that another teacher was also
involved in using and evaluating the VCC, but for external reasons was not able to use the resource to
any great extent and the findings from her class are excluded from the evaluation.
Students in both schools used the WCC, but the findings here relate to the students in the main-
stream school, as the numbers who used the WCC in the disadvantaged school were limited. The
learners were asked to provide their feedback on the WCC via an anonymous open and closed ques-
tionnaire. Nineteen students completed the survey (7 students were absent on the day of the survey).
Students reported that they liked using the WCC (yes (20%) and a little (50%), but 28% did not like it
and a minority (28%) did not find it helpful. A sizeable minority reported that they did not understand
the grammar error messages (42%) and spelling error messages (32%) and therefore, not surprisingly,
many (grammar 47%, spelling 30%) said that they did not find them helpful. Most students said that
they corrected their grammar errors (75%) and spelling errors (59%), although the empirical data does
confirm this. It must be noted that only 11% said they liked writing in Irish and a majority (63%) said
they would prefer to write in their copy than use the WCC. Table 7 provides a summary of the student
feedback on the WCC.

The mainstream school teacher also completed a questionnaire and the feedback was positive.
The teacher said that the WCC was beneficial for the students and enabled the students to construct
sentences and stories. She felt that it was at an appropriate level for the learners as all the students
could use the software. She said that it helped to consolidate classroom work. She said the main
problem was that she did not know enough about computers herself. The teacher in the disadvantaged
school initially came up with the idea to distinguish between grammar and spelling errors, as spelling

errors were not a priority for her. There were logistical difficulties for the teacher in that only four
students (out of 17) were considered sufficiently competent to use and benefit from the WCC. An-
other difficulty was the fact that the school computer lab was closed during the project academic year
and students had to travel to another venue to actually use the WCC – this obviously is not ideal.
Although both schools were boys-only schools in the same city, there are some significant differ-
ences between them. In the mainstream school, the students use the recommended textbook for their
class, while in the disadvantaged school the students use a textbook for a more junior year. Also,
more students are exempt from studying Irish in the disadvantaged school and there are fewer above-
average students. Classroom management is more difficult and there are students leaving and return-
ing to class from attending sessions with special needs teachers. This highlights the need to have
flexible resources that can be used as the teacher sees fit. While the teacher in the disadvantaged
school appreciated what the CALL resources can provide, their usage would probably be on a more
ad-hoc basis than in the mainstream school.
From a CALL development point of view, it was relatively straightforward to use both Irish NLP
tools. The IFSTME provides comprehensive information on Irish verbs. For pedagogical reasons, the
VCC only uses a small subset of the information. The students were learning only a limited set of
verbs, mainly regular verbs and some important irregular ones. In theory, the VCC could be modified
easily to incorporate a more complete list of verbs, persons and tenses (although this was not required
for this group of students). There were some difficulties in mapping and interpreting the conjugation
changes for irregular verbs, but it must be noted that the IFSTME was not intended as a verb conjuga-
tion mechanism. It was used in white-box mode (i.e. some internal knowledge of the software was
required for the VCC), but overall it was worthwhile using the IFSTME. Likewise, Gramadóir was a
useful NLP resource for developing the WCC. It was robust and reliable and it would not have been
possible to build the WCC without it.

5 Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989">
The VCC and the WCC demonstrate that it is possible and feasible to develop pedagogical, targeted
NLP CALL resources for Irish. It helped that the two NLP tools used were robust and of a high qual-
ity. The learners and teachers were unaware of the underlying technology (and this is desirable).
However, as is often the case, the problems were logistical rather than technical (Egbert et al., 2002;
Ward, 2007). Access to computers and “space in the timetable” hindered the continued deployment of
the Irish CALL resources.
It is important for NLP researchers working with any language to disseminate their findings and
make their resources available to people outside the NLP community. It is even more important for
NLP researchers working with minority languages to do so, as the resources are usually limited
(Woodbury, 2003; Lam et al., 2014) and the pool of people working with the language small. Speak-
ers, learners and other interested parties of minority languages are used to trying to do a lot with a lit-
tle, and making NLP resources available to them could lead to the development of resources not ini-
tially envisioned by the NLP researchers.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999943">
This paper reports on how two NLP resources for Irish (i.e. the IFSTME and Gramadóir) were used to
develop CALL resources for primary school children learning Irish. It shows that these NLP resources
for Irish can be adapted and used to develop appropriate CALL resources. In order for the CALL ma-
terials to be successful, it is important that there is a seamless integration of the NLP tools in the
CALL resources, so that the learner is unaware of their existence. Suitable, robust and accurate NLP
resources are required, if the CALL materials are to work in a real deployment situation. The CALL
resource should not fail or be inaccurate. The integration of the CALL resources with the curriculum
itself is key if the resources are actually going to be used by the teacher and the students (Bull and
Zakrzewski, 1997, Mc Carthy, 1999; Ward, 2007). This applies regardless of the language being stud-
ied – if the CALL resources do not help the teacher and aligned with the curriculum, they will not be
used. There are other, non-technical, non-NLP related factors that help or hinder the actual usage of
CALL resources. It should be noted that in order for the NLP resources to be used in the first place,
there needs to be an awareness of their existence - teachers and CALL developers must know that

relevant NLP resources are available. This places an onus on NLP researchers to disseminate their
research and tools to a wider audience than perhaps they would normally address. They could interact
with the CALL community via CALL conferences and especially with ICALL (Intelligent-CALL)
researchers via their Special Interest Groups (SIGs), conferences and workshops. This is particularly
pertinent in the minority and endangered language context (e.g. Irish and other Celtic languages),
where technical, financial and researcher resources are limited.

It shows how two Irish NLP resources, the Irish Finite State Transducer Mor- Engine (IFSTME) (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002) and 2005) were used as the underlying engines for two Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) resources for Irish.

In order to develop CALL materials that were not just an electronic form of a textbook, it was considered important to incorporate existing NLP resources into the CALL materials. This would have the benefit of not re-inventing the wheel and of using tools that had been designed and testing by a knowledgeable NLP researcher, rather than starting from scratch. The paper reports on the successful development of the CALL resources and some positive feedback from students and teachers. There are several non-technical reasons, mainly logistical, which hinder the deployment of Irish CALL resources in schools, but Irish NLP researchers should strive to disseminate their research and findings to a wider audience than usual, if they wish others to benefit from their work.</abstract>

In many primary schools in Ireland, there may not be a computer in the classroom and so the students have to use a computer lab. Often, the computers are relatively old and are of a low specification, and the students have limited access to the lab. In their weekly computer slot, the teacher has to decide to use the time for English, mathematics or other school subjects. Many CALL resources do not use any NLP e.g. the BBC Languages (World Service English) (BBC, 2014) is a general CALL resource for English language learners. Intelligent CALL (ICALL) mainly draws on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (Matthews, 1993). NLP technologies can be used in CALL resources for concordancing, morphological processing and syntactic processing (Nerbonne, 2003). There are many reasons why NLP technologies are not widely used in CALL. NLP is inherently difficult and there are difficulties in integrating NLP in CALL resources.

It reports on the motivation for using CALL and specifically NLP/CALL in the primary school context in Ireland. Irish is a compulsory subject in primary schools in Ireland and most students spend 13 years studying the language (Murtagh, 2003), but it is not a particularly popular subject (6 Riagáin and 6 Glíasáin, 1994, DCRGA, 2009) . CALL has many potential benefits for the language learner and it is important the students learning Irish have access to reliable, good quality CALL resources. However, it is difficult to develop such CALL resources, as usually a multi-disciplinary team is required, and such a team is often hard to assemble. One approach is to try to adapt and reuse existing resources to speed up the development process and indeed, provide resources that might not otherwise exist. With this in mind, two existing NLP resources for Irish were used to develop CALL resources for students in the primary school c</context>

Its use started to decline around this time and today there are approximately 20,000 active speakers (Ó hÉallaithe, 2004). Irish has had a complex, paradoxical sociocultural role in Ireland. On the one hand, people in Ireland appreciate the importance of having a national language that is distinct to Ireland and understand its cultural role (DCRGA, 2009). However, they are somewhat ambivalent about its role in the education system. 2.2 Education There are several pedagogical issues with the teaching of Irish in schools in Ireland. It is one of the core subjects and is taught on a daily basis. Often there is a lack of interest on the part of the students and their parents. Reasons such as ‘it’s a useless language, no one speaks it anymore’, or ‘why don’t they teach French/Chinese instead?’ are sometimes heard. Some students find it difficult. Eleven of the most commonly used verbs are highly irregular, which can be daunting and confusing for y</context>

In many primary schools, students have to pay for their own books, with some schools operating book rental schemes. This means that for any schools there is little or no incentive to change the books series that they use for teaching Irish. Furthermore, given the non-positive attitude some parents have towards the time/effort devoted to teaching and learning Irish in primary school, they are often not receptive to moving to a different book series if they do not have the option to buy pre-owned books for older children in the school. Harris and Murtagh (1999) and Hickey and Stenson (2010) provide a good overview of the Irish education field. 2.3 Lack of Suitable Resources One possible strategy to incorporate a more modern approach is to use electronic resources. However, many of the resources available are not particularly suitable for primary schools students, as they are aimed at adults or may not be very accurate. Adults may be able to comprehend that the information that they see online may not be totally correct, but primary school students are not accustomed to this, as they expect the information to be correct all the time.

It can help with learner motivation (e.g. Murphy and Hurd, 2011) and provide a degree of privacy for students.

Students can work at their own pace when using CALL resources – something which can be helpful in a mixed-ability class.

It reports on the motivation for using CALL and specifically NLP/CALL in the primary school context in Ireland. Irish is a compulsory subject in primary schools in Ireland and most students spend 13 years studying the language (Murtagh, 2003), but it is not a particularly popular subject (6 Riagáin and 6 Glíasáin, 1994, DCRGA, 2009) . CALL has many potential benefits for the language learner and it is important the students learning Irish have access to reliable, good quality CALL resources. However, it is difficult to develop such CALL resources, as usually a multi-disciplinary team is required, and such a team is often hard to assemble. One approach is to try to adapt and reuse existing resources to speed up the development process and indeed, provide resources that might not otherwise exist. With this in mind, two existing NLP </context>

However, in order to make use of the NLP resources that are currently available to CALL developers, it behoves NLP researchers to make their research widely available and comprehensible to a non-NLP knowledgeable audience. Of course, CALL researchers should also try to interact with the NLP community for a fruitful exchange of ideas and knowledge. 2 Background Irish used to be the lingua franca in Ireland many centuries ago, but this is no longer the case. However, the vast majority of school students in Ireland study Irish for 13 years (Murtagh, 2003) in both primary and secondary school. There are several challenges to the teaching of Irish, including attitude, potential pedagogical difficulties and lack of suitable resources (including computer-based resources). This section looks at the place of Irish in the primary school system in Ireland, the problem of lack of suitable, high-quality, reliable resources for Irish for learners in general and especially for primary school children. It also looks at the role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in the teaching and learning of Irish. 2.1 Iri</context>

In their weekly computer slot, the teacher has to decide to use the time for English, mathematics or other school subjects. Many CALL resources do not use any NLP e.g. the BBC Languages (World Service English) (BBC, 2014) is a general CALL resource for English language learners. Intelligent CALL (ICALL) mainly draws on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (Matthews, 1993). NLP technologies can be used in CALL resources for concordancing, morphological processing and syntactic processing (Nerbonne, 2003). There are many reasons why NLP technologies are not widely used in CALL. NLP is inherently difficult and there are difficulties in integrating NLP in CALL resources. NLP researchers and NLP research is not CALL-based and there are difficulties in visualising how NLP can be used in CALL resources. Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge amongst CALL practitioners about NLP, as the use of NLP in CALL has been driven by NLP specialists rather than CALL practitioners.

It also looks at the role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in the teaching and learning of Irish. 2.1 Irish Irish is a morphologically-rich language that was the lingua-franca of the majority of people in Ireland until around the 17th century. Its use started to decline around this time and today there are approximately 20,000 active speakers (Ó hÉallaithe, 2004). Irish has had a complex, paradoxical sociocultural role in Ireland. On the one hand, people in Ireland appreciate the importance of having a national language that is distinct to Ireland and understand its cultural role (DCRGA, 2009). However, they are somewhat ambivalent about its role in the education system. 2.2 Education There are several pedagogical issues with the teaching of Irish in schools in Ireland. It is one of the core subjects and is taught on a daily basis. Often there is a lack of interest on the part of the students and their parents. Reasons such as ‘it’s a useless language</context>

The IFSTME was used to generate the verb conjugations for verbs in the past simple tense. The aim of the Verb Conjugation Component (VCC) is to provide a tool to produce static and animated verb conjugation web pages based on externally supplied verb data. The underlying engine is an Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (IFSTME) (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002). It was combined with an animation tool (Koller, 2004) and a CALL Template (Ward, 2001) to provide an Irish verb learning tool for primary school students.

It was robust and reliable and it would not have been possible to build the WCC without it. 5 Discussion The VCC and the WCC demonstrate that it is possible and feasible to develop pedagogical, targeted NLP CALL resources for Irish. It helped that the two NLP tools used were robust and of a high quality. The learners and teachers were unaware of the underlying technology (and this is desirable). However, as is often the case, the problems were logistical rather than technical (Egbert et al., 2002; Ward, 2007). Access to computers and “space in the timetable” hindered the continued deployment of the Irish CALL resources. It is important for NLP researchers working with any language to disseminate their findings and make their resources available to people outside the NLP community. It is even more important for NLP researchers working with minority languages to do so, as the resources are usually limited (Woodbury, 2003; Lam et al., 2014) and the pool of people working with the language small. Speakers, learners and other interested parties of minority languages are used to trying to do a lot with </context>

In order for the CALL materials to be successful, it is important that there is a seamless integration of the NLP tools in the CALL resources, so that the learner is unaware of their existence. Suitable, robust and accurate NLP resources are required, if the CALL materials are to work in a real deployment situation. The CALL resource should not fail or be inaccurate. The integration of the CALL resources with the curriculum itself is key if the resources are actually going to be used by the teacher and the students (Bull and Zakrzewski, 1997, Mc Carthy, 1999; Ward, 2007). This applies regardless of the language being studied – if the CALL resources do not help the teacher and aligned with the curriculum, they will not be used. There are other, non-technical, non-NLP related factors that help or hinder the actual usage of CALL resources. It should be noted that in order for the NLP resources to be used in the first place, there needs to be an awareness of their existence - teachers and CALL developers must know that 15 relevant NLP resources are available. This places an onus on NLP researchers to disseminate their research and tools to a wider audience than p</context>

However, as is often the case, the problems were logistical rather than technical (Egbert et al., 2002; Ward, 2007). Access to computers and “space in the timetable” hindered the continued deployment of the Irish CALL resources. It is important for NLP researchers working with any language to disseminate their findings and make their resources available to people outside the NLP community. It is even more important for NLP researchers working with minority languages to do so, as the resources are usually limited (Woodbury, 2003; Lam et al., 2014) and the pool of people working with the language small. Speakers, learners and other interested parties of minority languages are used to trying to do a lot with a little, and making NLP resources available to them could lead to the development of resources not initially envisioned by the NLP researchers. 6 Conclusion This paper reports on how two NLP resources for Irish (i.e. the IFSTME and Gramadóir) were used to develop CALL resources for primary school children learning Irish. It shows that these NLP resources for Irish can be adapted and used to develop appropriate CAL</context>

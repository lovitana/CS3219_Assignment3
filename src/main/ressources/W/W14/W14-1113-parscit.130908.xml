<bodyText confidence="0.999884347826087">
The aim of this work is to infer a model
able to extract cause-effect relations be-
tween drugs and diseases. A two-level
system is proposed. The first level car-
ries out a shallow analysis of Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) in order to iden-
tify medical concepts such as drug brand-
names, substances, diseases, etc. Next,
all the combination pairs formed by a
concept from the group of drugs (drug
and substances) and the group of diseases
(diseases and symptoms) are characterised
through a set of 57 features. A supervised
classifier inferred on those features is in
charge of deciding whether that pair rep-
resents a cause-effect type of event.
One of the challenges of this work is the
fact that the system explores the entire
document. The contributions of this pa-
per stand on the use of real EHRs to dis-
cover adverse drug reaction events even in
different sentences. Besides, the work fo-
cuses on Spanish language.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999913963636364">
This work deals with semantic data mining within
the clinical domain. The aim is to automatically
highlight the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in
EHRs in order to alleviate the work-load to sev-
eral services within a hospital (pharmacy service,
documentation service,...) that have to read these
reports. Event detection was thoroughly tackled in
the Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data
2010 Challenge. Since then, cause-effect event ex-
traction has emerged as a field of interest in the
Biomedical domain (Bj¨orne et al., 2010; Mihaila
et al., 2013). The motivation is, above all, practi-
cal. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are studied
by several services in the hospital, not only by the
doctor in charge of the patient but also by the phar-
macy and documentation services, amongst oth-
ers. There are some attempts in the literature that
aim to make the reading of the reports in English
easier and less time-consuming by means of an au-
tomatic annotation toolkit (Rink et al., 2011; Bot-
sis et al., 2011; Toldo et al., 2012). This work is
a first approach on automatic learning of relations
between drugs causing diseases in Spanish EHRs.
This work presents a system that entails two
stages in cascade: 1) the first one carries out the
annotation of drugs or substances (from now on-
wards both of them shall be referred to as DRUG)
and diseases or symptoms (referred to as DIS-
EASE); 2) the second one determines whether a
given (DRUG, DISEASE) pair of concepts repre-
sents a cause-effect reaction. Note that we are in-
terested in highlighting events involving (DRUG,
DISEASE) pairs where the drug caused an adverse
reaction or a disease. By contrast, often, (DRUG,
DISEASE) pairs would entail a drug prescribed to
combat a disease, but these correspond to a differ-
ent kind of events (indeed, diametrically opposed).
Besides, (DRUG, DISEASE) pairs might represent
other sort of events or they might even be unre-
lated at all. Finally, the system should present the
ADRs marked in a friendly front-end. To this end,
the aim is to represent the text in the framework
provided by Brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012). Figure 1
shows an example, represented in Brat, of some
cause-effect events manually tagged by experts.
There are related works in this field aiming at
a variety of biomedical event extraction, such as
binary protein-protein interaction (Wong, 2001),
biomolecular event extraction (Kim et al., 2011),
and drug-drug interaction extraction (Segura-
Bedmar et al., 2013). We are focusing on a variety
of interaction extraction: drugs causing diseases.
There are previous works in the literature that try
to warn whether a document contains or not this
type of events. There are more recent works that

cope with event extraction within the same sen-
tence, that is, intra-sentence events. By contrast, in
this work we have realised that around 26% of the
events occur between concepts that are in differ-
ent sentences. Moreover, some of them are at very
long distance. Hence, our method aims at provid-
ing all the (DRUG, DISEASE) concepts within the
document that represent a cause-effect relation.
We cope with real discharge EHRs written by
around 400 different doctors. These records are
not written in a template, that is, the EHRs do not
follow a pre-determined structure, and this, by it-
self entails a challenge. The EHRs we are dealing
with are written in a free structure using natural
language, non-standard abbreviations etc. More-
over, we tackle Spanish language, for which little
work has been carried out. In addition, we do not
only aim at single concept-words but also at con-
cepts based on multi-word terms.

<bodyText confidence="0.999862375">
In the first stage, relevant pairs of concepts have
to be identified within an EHR. Concept annota-
tion is accomplished by means of a shallow anal-
yser system (described in section 2.1). Once the
analyser has detected (DRUG, DISEASE) pairs in
a document, all the pairs will be examined by
an inferred supervised classifier (described in sec-
tion 2.2).

2.1 Annotating concepts by shallow analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998562">
The first stage of the system has to detect and an-
notate two types of semantic concepts: drugs and
diseases. Each concept, as requested by the phar-
macy service, should gather several sub-concepts
stated as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999489818181818">
1. DRUG concept:
(a) Generic names for pharmaceutical
drugs: e.g. corticoids;
(b) Brand-names for pharmaceutical drugs:
e.g. Aspirin;
(c) Active ingredients: e.g. vancomycin;
(d) Substances: e.g. dust, rubber;
2. DISEASE concept:
(a) Diseases
(b) Signs
(c) Symptoms
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997973">
These concepts were identified by means of a
general purpose analyser available for Spanish,
called FreeLing (Padr´o et al., 2010), that had been
enhanced with medical ontologies and dictionar-
ies, such as SNOMED-CT, BotPLUS, ICD-9-CM,
etc. (Oronoz et al., 2013). This toolkit is able
to identify multi-word context-terms, lemmas and
also POS tags. An example of the morphological,
semantic and syntactic analysis, provided by this
parser is given in Figure 3. In the figure two pieces
of information can be distinguished: for exam-
ple, given the word “secundarios” (meaning sec-
ondaries) 1) the POS tag provided is AQOM corre-
sponding to Qualificative Adjective Ordinal Mas-
culine Singular; and 2) the provided lemma is “se-
cundario” (secondary). Besides, in a third layer,
the semantic tag is given, that is, the tag “ENFER-
MEDAD” (meaning disease) involves the multi-
word concept “HTP severa” (severe pulmonary
hypertension).

<bodyText confidence="0.999661176470588">
The goal of the second stage is to determine if a
given (DRUG, DISEASE) pair represents an ADR
event or not. On account of this, we resorted to
supervised classification models. These models
can be automatically inferred from a set of doc-
uments in which the target concepts had been pre-
viously annotated. Hence, first of all, a set of an-
notated data representative for the task is required.
To this end, our starting point is a manually anno-
tated corpus (presented in section 2.2.1). Besides,
in order to automatically learn the classifier, the
(DRUG, DISEASE) pairs have to be described in an
operative way, that is, in terms of a finite-set of
features (see section 2.2.2). The supervised clas-
sification model selected was a type of ensemble
classifier: Random Forests (for further details turn
to section 2.2.3).

A supervised classifier was inferred from an-
notated real EHRs. The annotation was carried
out by doctors from the same hospital that pro-
duced the EHRs. Given the text with the con-
cepts marked on the first stage (turn to section 2.1)
and represented within the framework provided by
Brat1, around 4 doctors from the same hospital an-
notated the events. This annotated set would work
as a source of data to get instances that would
serve to train supervised classification models, as
the one referred in section 2.2.

following sets:
• Concept-words and context-words: to be
precise, we make use of entire terms
including both single-words and multi-
words.
– DRUG concept-word together with
left and right context words (a con-
text up to 3, yielding, thus, 7 fea-
tures).
– DISEASE concept-word together

whether the concept words or their con-
text was either negated or speculated (2

• Distance: the number of characters from

mine if there exists an ADR event (that is, a cause-

to Random Forests (RFs), a variety of ensemble
models. RFs combine a number of decision trees
being each tree built on the basis of the C4.5 algo-
rithm (Quinlan, 1993) but with a distinctive char-
acteristic: some randomness is introduced in the
order in which the nodes are generated. Particu-
larly, each time a node is generated in the tree, in-
stead of chosing the attribute that maximizes the
Information Gain, the attribute is randomly se-
lected amongst the k best options. We made use
of the implementation of this algorithm available
in Weka-6.9 (Hall et al., 2009). Ensemble models
were proved useful on drug-drug interaction ex-
traction tasks (Thomas et al., 2011).

We count on data consisting of discharge sum-
maries from Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital. The
records are semi-structured in the sense that there
are two main fields: the first one for personal data
of the patient (age, dates relating to admittance)
that were not provided by the hospital for privacy
issues; and the second one, our target, a single
field that contains the antecedents, treatment, clin-
ical analysis, etc. This second field is an unstruc-
tured section (some hospitals rely upon templates
that divide this field into several subfields, provid-
ing it with further structure). The discharge notes
describe a chronological development of the pa-
tient’s condition, the undergone treatments, and
also the clinical tests that were carried out.
Given the entire set of manually annotated doc-
uments, 34% were randomly selected without re-
placement to produce the evaluation set. The re-
sulting partition is presented in Table 1 (where the
train and evaluation sets are referred to as Train
and Eval respectivelly).

<bodyText confidence="0.99990952631579">
This work presents a system that first identifies rel-
evant pairs of concepts in EHRs by means of a
shallow analysis and next examines all the pairs
by an inferred supervised classifier to determine if
a given pair represents a cause-effect event. A rel-
evant contribution of this work is that we extract
events occurring between concepts that are in dif-
ferent sentences. In addition, this is one of the first
works on medical event extraction for Spanish.
Our aim for future work is to determine whether
the (DRUG, DISEASE) pair represents either a rela-
tion where 1) the drug is to overcome the disease;
2) the drug causes the disease; 3) there is no rela-
tionship between the drug and the disease.
The aim of context features is to capture charac-
teristics of the text surrounding the relevant con-
cepts that trigger a relation. More features could
also be explored such as trigger words, regular pat-
terns, n-grams, etc.

Besides, the work focuses on Spanish language. 1 Introduction This work deals with semantic data mining within the clinical domain. The aim is to automatically highlight the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in EHRs in order to alleviate the work-load to several services within a hospital (pharmacy service, documentation service,...) that have to read these reports. Event detection was thoroughly tackled in the Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data 2010 Challenge. Since then, cause-effect event extraction has emerged as a field of interest in the Biomedical domain (Bj¨orne et al., 2010; Mihaila et al., 2013). The motivation is, above all, practical. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are studied by several services in the hospital, not only by the doctor in charge of the patient but also by the pharmacy and documentation services, amongst others. There are some attempts in the literature that aim to make the reading of the reports in English easier and less time-consuming by means of an automatic annotation toolkit (Rink et al., 2011; Botsis et al., 2011; Toldo et al., 2012). This work is a first approach on automatic learning of relations between drugs causing diseases in Spanish EHRs. This work p</context>

DRUG concept: (a) Generic names for pharmaceutical drugs: e.g. corticoids; (b) Brand-names for pharmaceutical drugs: e.g. Aspirin; (c) Active ingredients: e.g. vancomycin; (d) Substances: e.g. dust, rubber; 2. DISEASE concept: (a) Diseases (b) Signs (c) Symptoms These concepts were identified by means of a general purpose analyser available for Spanish, called FreeLing (Padr´o et al., 2010), that had been enhanced with medical ontologies and dictionaries, such as SNOMED-CT, BotPLUS, ICD-9-CM, etc. (Oronoz et al., 2013). This toolkit is able to identify multi-word context-terms, lemmas and also POS tags. An example of the morphological, semantic and syntactic analysis, provided by this parser is given in Figure 3. In the figure two pieces of information can be distinguished: for example, given the word “secundarios” (meaning secondaries) 1) the POS tag provided is AQOM corresponding to Qualificative Adjective Ordinal Masculine Singular; and 2) the provided lemma is “secundario” (secondary). Besides, in a third layer, the semantic tag is given, that is, the tag “ENFERMEDAD” (meaning disease) involves the mult</context>

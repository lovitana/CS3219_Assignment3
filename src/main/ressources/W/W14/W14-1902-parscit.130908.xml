Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999559">
The requirements of user interface for
dyslexics have not been yet properly
explored. Accessibility to any kind of
information or just to entertainment web
pages is a key factor to equality of rights,
moreover it breaks down social barriers.
Considering that study materials are
nowadays very much accessible through
internet, by accommodating web content to
anyhow disabled users must be seen as
natural thing. Dyslexia is considered as an
cognitive impairment arising from visual
similarity of letters, therefore we focus on
Czech language which uses special
characters. The aim of our research is to
introduce an application that allows dyslexics
to decode text easier and understand it
properly.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957111111111">
Unlike for blind or deaf people, it is quite
difficult to identify requirements for users with
dyslexia, as they are very individual. The
dyslexics&apos; inability to decode information is
socially restrictive as much as the inability of
visually impaired to read the information
(Deibel, 2006). For more, missing one sense is
balanced by higher sensitivity of other senses.
But dyslexics do not miss a sense.
According to psycho-linguistic studies
(Marshall and Newcombe, 1973; Friedman et al.,
2012), the words in text should not contain more
letters (or letters close to each other) that are
visually similar. It counts letters like b, p, d, o, q
etc. Also, dyslexics find very hard encoding
words that are too long for them. Such a word
should be broken up by linguistic or visual
syllable, depending on the order of problematic9
symbols. In Czech language it might be: nej-roz-
ši-ře-něj-ši instead of nejrozšířenější (“the most
widely used”, by linguistic syllable, too long
word), kap-oun instead of ka-poun etc. (“fish”,
visually). The finding, reported in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences (Siok et al.,
2008) surprisingly shows that there is significant
difference in ability to decode words in different
languages.

<bodyText confidence="0.9976158">
The main elements causing reading inability
dwells in visual attention deficit and letter
concentration, both based in neural cognition.
Research that was done with eye tracker shows
that at least one third of probands have
difficulties with catching text with eyes
(Bellocchi et al., 2013). The same results are
indicated in independent study of Laboratory for
visual Learning at the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory (Schneps et al., 2013).
For instance mobile application American
Wordspeller &amp; Phonetic Dictionary helps users
to check their writing and converts phonetic
spelling into the proper one. Other software that
use text to speech conversion, so that users do
not have to deal with visual matter, are Web
Reader and CapturaTalk. In past year, IDEAL,
the e-book reader was introduced by Rello
(2012). Anyway, this application is not a solution
for modifying too long words or words with a
combination of wrong letters. Moreover, Czech
language is too complicated to get by with
IDEAL application.
Most of the applications use text to speech
conversion approach for its usefulness and
simplicity. However, reading should not be
avoided by dyslexics. The research study
Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Speech and Language Processing for Assistive Technologies (SLPAT), pages 9–12,
Baltimore, Maryland USA, August 26 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics
conducted by experts from the Institute of
Education, University of London shows that
reading strenghts attention, brain cognition and
information processing over time (Battye and
Rainsberry, 2013). Therefore, an application
based on text modification is very much needed.

3 The Complexity of the Czech
Language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999815">
Czech language belongs to West Slavic language
class. It is inflected language, characterized by a
complicated system of declension and
conjugation. According to the complexity and a
huge vocabulary, the use of applications for
instance offering synonyms seems not usable.
The declension and conjugation that affects
nouns and verbs are grammatical tasks that
makes the language and assistive applications
most complicated.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.992598">
3.1 Declension
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999965625">
Czech speakers typically refer to the noun cases
by number and learn them by means of the
question and answer (Šaur, 2004). These
numbers do not necessarily correspond to
numbered cases in other languages. Nouns,
adjectives, pronouns and numbers are declined,
there are seven cases over a number of
declension models (Tab. 1).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998824">
3.2 Conjugation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9227962">
Conjugation applies to verbs. It is a system of
grammatically-determined modifications. There
are several types of conjugation with more or
less complicated rules. A brief overview is in
Tab. 2.

3.3 Phonetical and Grammatical Syllables
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999952230769231">
Czech language, as it was stated, is a quit hard
language with many words that follow
declension and conjugation. It is still under
linguistic concern how to divide syllables in
Czech words. There are rules that often do not
follow natural feelings of those speaking Czech,
respectively those whose Czech is a mother
language (Moravec-Robur, 1939). Automatic
syllabication is therefore still not flawless and
there may be accidental errors that would make
dyslexics even more confused. Moreover,
phonological syllable does not omit proximity of
problematic letters that are hardly decodable.

4 Methodology
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998943">
4.1 Experimental Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999785636363636">
We introduce an application that modifies text
according to needs of Czech language
environment.
Because the complexity of words depends on
individual language, we have to find out the
pattern that makes the Czech words hard to
decode. We prepare sets of text, one that is
original and contains general, non-scientific
words, one that divides the letters according to
linguistic syllables and the last one that divides
the letters in words according to visual syllables.

Figure 1. The three texts read by dyslexics.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999623642857143">
Each set has 3 texts which are similar in length.
To avoid subjectivity, the proband cannot be
tested with same text but we need the texts to be
similar as much as possible (Fig. 1). The
dyslexics read the three texts, not told what the
aim of the experiment is. We measure how fast
the dyslexic read each text while the text is read
loudly to avoid distorting elements like skipping
letters, returning etc. The text with phonological
(grammatical) syllables divides the letters only in
words they appear in. For exact measurement we
use a system reacting on sound so while the
dyslexic start reading, the tool starts measuring
and stops when the last letter is read.

problematic words.
</figureCaption>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995219">
4.2 Technical Approach
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999989181818182">
Among observation, we need a tool that will
detect long words and visually similar letters in
the words (according to above mentioned
pattern). For modifying the text we use syntactic
analyzer that looks for symbols given in a rule
that was set according to general text reading
problems. For instance, a diagram using cyclical
algorithm defines the way to detect such
words/letters (Fig. 2). The tool will be built up
using state machine.
To the system in Figure 2, if NIS is for
example ≥ 2, the word is possibly hard to decode
and has to be broken up into syllables or visually
not similar groups of letters. For instance a word
“podobná” has more than 2 problematic letters
close to each other (there are 5 problematic
letters together – p+o+d+o+b) so the letters in
the word should be broken up at least after two
of such letters (po-do-bná), better after each of
the letter (p-o-d-o-bná), depending on preset rule
for each language. The same way we detect
number of letters contained in a single word.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996532">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999276">
The only need is to determine what letters,
respectively what pair or triplet of letters are
problematic for exact language. Once the
observation is done, the application we design
can be used for any language.

5 Scientific and Practical Impact
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999825">
Based on previous work that was done in area of
dyslexic users, within psychological, linguistic
and technical studies, we strongly believe that
our solution fits best to dyslexics who are very
individual users to work with. There are no
standards, like WCAG 2.0 for general
accessibility that would make web designers and
ICT developers to follow such needs. First, they
would have to care about accommodating these
needs in every single webpage, ebook, ICT tool.
It seems impossible, too hard and time
consuming. Second, designers and developers
have almost none of experience with dyslexic
users and self-experience is more than needed
when building an assistive technology tool.
We believe that our research, proving explicit
problems that dyslexics deal with, will move the
research in assistive technologies far more ahead.
Existing applications are helpful but do not fulfill
the needs as much as they could. We add value
to actual applications and make the gap between
society and people with special needs smaller.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.998614" genericHeader="conclusions">
6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999895916666667">
The outcome of the application is necessary to
confront with a sufficient group of dyslexics. It is
generally stated that up to one twentieth of
population suffers from learning and
concentration disabilities, although only some of
them are diagnosed (Rello et al., 2013). It would
be unethical to stop having interests in
problematic with dyslexia.
Our future work will be directed the way of
developing proposed tool, to make it usable in e-
books, study materials, and within daily routine
needs.

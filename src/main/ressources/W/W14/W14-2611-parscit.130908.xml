In the past years, there has been an increasing
amount of research done in the field of Sentiment
Analysis. This was motivated by the growth in the
volume of user-generated online data, the infor-
mation flood in Social Media and the applications
Sentiment Analysis has to different fields – Mar-
keting, Business Intelligence, e-Law Making, De-
cision Support Systems, etc. Although many
methods have been proposed to deal with senti-
ment detection and classification in diverse types
of texts and languages, many challenges still arise
when passing these methods from the research
settings to real-life applications.
In this talk, we will describe the manner in which
we employed machine translation together with
human-annotated data to extend a sentiment anal-
ysis system to various languages. Additionally,
we will describe how a joint multilingual model
that detects and classifies sentiments expressed in
texts from Social Media has been developed (at
this point for Twitter and Facebook) and demo its
use in a real-life application: a project aimed at
detecting the citizens’ attitude on Science and
Technology.

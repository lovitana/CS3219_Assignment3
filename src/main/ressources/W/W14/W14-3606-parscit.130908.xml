In this paper we describe a framework for
classifying and annotating Egyptian Ara-
bic Multiword Expressions (EMWE) in a
specialized computational lexical re-
source. The framework intends to en-
compass comprehensive linguistic infor-
mation for each MWE including: a. pho-
nological and orthographic information;
b. POS tags; c. structural information for
the phrase structure of the expression; d.
lexicographic classification; e. semantic
classification covering semantic fields
and semantic relations; f. degree of idio-
maticity where we adopt a three-level rat-
ing scale; g. pragmatic information in the
form of usage labels; h. Modern Standard
Arabic equivalents and English transla-
tions, thereby rendering our resource a
three-way – Egyptian Arabic, Modern
Standard Arabic and English – repository
for MWEs.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999816301886793">
Multiword expressions (MWEs) comprise a wide
range of diverse, arbitrary and yet linguistically
related phenomena that share the characteristic of
crossing word boundaries (Sag et al., 2002).
MWEs are computationally challenging because
the exact interpretation of an MWE is not direct-
ly obtained from its component parts. MWEs are
intrinsically single units on the deep conceptual
and semantic levels, but on the surface (lexical
and syntactic) levels they are expressed as multi-
ple units. MWEs vary in their syntactic category,
morphological behavior, and degree of semantic
opaqueness. MWEs are pervasively present in
natural texts, which makes it imperative to tackle
them explicitly if we aspire to make large-scale,
linguistically-motivated, and precise processing
of a human language.
Integrating MWEs in NLP applications has
evidently and consistently shown to improve the
performance in tasks such as Information Re-
trieval (Acosta et al. 2011; da Silva and Souza,
2012), Text Mining (SanJuan and Ibekwe-
SanJuan, 2006), Syntactic Parsing (Eryiğit et al.,
2011; Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Attia, 2006;
Korkontzelos and Manandhar, 2010), Machine
Translation (Deksne, 2008; Carpuat and Diab,
2010; Ghoneim and Diab 2013; Bouamor et al.,
2011), Question Answering, and Named-Entity
extraction (Bu et al., 2011).
In the current work, we propose guidelines for
detailed linguistic annotation of an MWE lexicon
for dialectal (Egyptian) Arabic that covers,
among other types, expressions that are tradi-
tionally classified as idioms (e.g. L11-�i c,6 EalaY
Alriyq 1 ‘on an empty stomach’), prepositional
verbs (e.g. c,6 CS-4 tawak—al EalaY ‘rely on’),
compound nouns (e.g. _)ssA S_)U) &lt;i$Arap muruwr
‘traffic light’), and collocations (e.g. شﺵدﺩﺪﺧأﺃ
&gt;axad du$— ‘to take a shower’).
Creating a repository of annotated MWEs that
is focused on dialects is essential for computa-
tional linguistics research as it provides a crucial
resource that is conducive to better analysis and
understanding of the user-generated content rife
in the social media (such as Facebook, Twitter,
blogs, and forums). Moreover, it helps in under-
standing he correspondences between different
languages and their representation of the seman-
tic space. We hope that the multilingual data in
this repository will lead to a significant en-
hancement in the processing of comparable and
parallel corpora. We believe that our proposed
framework will contribute to the sustainability of

MWE research in general, and provide a blue
print for research on MWEs in dialects, informal
vernaculars, as well as morphologically rich lan-
guages.
MWE are not only interesting from an NLP
perspective but also from a linguistic perspec-
tive, as MWE can help in understanding the link
between lexicon, syntax and semantics. Until
now, this is hampered by the lack of comprehen-
sive resources for MWEs with fine-grained clas-
sification on different dimensions related to se-
mantic roles and syntactic functions. Arabic
comprises numerous divergent dialects, and hav-
ing an annotated MWE lexical resource in dia-
lects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) will
allow for studying transformation, change and
development in this language.
From a theoretical linguistic point of view, our
work will be interesting particularly in studies
related to Diglossia. Diglossia (Walters, 1996) is
where two languages or dialects exist side by
side within a community, where typically one is
used in formal contexts while the other is used in
informal communications and interactions. Stud-
ying the MWE space for dialects and MSA as a
continuum will lead to deeper insights into varia-
tions as we note intersection and overlap be-
tween the two. In many instances, we see that
MSA MWEs and their dialectal equivalents are
not necessarily shared as they occupy comple-
mentary linguistic spaces. However, the nature of
this complementarity and its cultural and social
implications will need more exploration and in-
vestigation, which will be possible once a com-
plete resource becomes available.
In the current work, we give detailed descrip-
tion of our methodology and guidelines for anno-
tating phonological, morphological, syntactic,
semantic and pragmatic information of an Egyp-
tian Multiword Expressions (EMWE) lexical
resource. Our annotation scheme covers the fol-
lowing areas.

<bodyText confidence="0.999925897435897">
There are four main areas of research on MWEs:
extraction from structured and unstructured data,
construction of lexicons for specific languages,
integration in NLP applications, and the con-
struction of guidelines and best practices. A sig-
nificant amount of research has focused on the
identification and extraction of MWEs (Ramisch
et al., 2010; Dubremetz and Nivre, 2014; Attia et
al., 2010; Weller and Heid, 2010; Schneider et
al., 2014). Description and specifications of
MWE lexical resources have been presented for
Japanese (Shudo et al. 2011), Italian (Zaninello
and Nissim, 2010), Dutch (Gr6goire, 2010;
Odijk, 2013), and Modern Standard Arabic
(Hawwari et al., 2012). Moreover, Calzolari et al.
(2002) presented a project that attempted to in-
troduce best practice recommendations for the
treatment of MWE in mono- and multi-lingual
computational lexicons that incorporate both
syntactic and semantic information, but the limi-
tation of their work is that they focus on only two
types of MWEs, namely, support verbs and noun
compounds.
Apart from Schneider et al. (2014), who fo-
cused on the language of the social web, none of
these projects dealt with informal or dialectal
languages, which are rampant in user-generated
content (UGC). With the explosion of social me-
dia, the language of Web 2.0 is undergoing fun-
damental changes: English is no longer dominat-
ing the web, and UGC is outpacing professional-
ly edited content.
UGC is re-shaping the way people are con-
suming and dealing with information, as the user
is no longer a passive recipient, but has now
turned into an active participant, and in many
instances, a source or producer of information.
Social media have empowered users to be more
creative and interactive, and allowed them to

voice their opinions on events and products and
exert powerful influence on the behavior and
opinion of others. Yet, the current overflow of
UGC poses significant challenges in data gather-
ing, annotation and presentation.

3 MWE Taxonomy
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960400000001">
Although the importance of the MWEs has
been acknowledged by many researchers in the
field of NLP as evident by the large number of
research papers and dedicated workshops in the
past decade, the theory of MWEs is still
underdeveloped (Sag et al., 2002). There is
critical need for studying MWEs both from the
theoretical and practical point of views. MWEs
have diverse categories, varying degrees of
idiomaticity, different syntactic compositions,
and different morphological, lexical and
syntactic behavior, and dealing with them is
complicated even further by the fact that there is
no “watertight criteria” for distinguishing them
them (Atkins and Rundell, 2008).
Moreover, there is no universally-agreed tax-
onomy of MWEs (Ramisch, 2012), and different
researchers proposed different typology for this
phenomena. Fillmore et al. (1988) proposed three
types based on lexical and syntactic familiarity:
a) unfamiliar pieces familiarly combined, b) fa-
miliar pieces unfamiliarly combined, and c) fa-
miliar pieces familiarly combined. Mel&apos;čuk
(1989), on the other hand, introduced three
different classes: a) complete phraseme, b) semi-
phraseme, c) and quasi-phraseme. Sag et al.
introduced two classes: institutionalized phrases
and lexicalized phrases, with lexicalized phrases
subdivided into fixed, semi-fixed and
syntactically flexible expressions. Ramisch
(2012) introduced yet another set of classes:
nominal, verbal and adverbial expressions.
From the lexicographic point of view, the leg-
acy three-way division of MWEs proved to be
too coarse-grained to cater for the needs of lexi-
cographers who need to identify the large array
of sub-types that fall under the umbrella of
‘MWEs’. Atkins and Rundell (2008) empha-
sized the need for lexicographers to be able to
recognize MWE types such as fixed phrases,
transparent collocations, similes, catch phrases,
proverbs, quotations, greetings, phatic expres-
sions, compounds, phrasal verbs, and support
verbs.
When we look deeply into the different classi-
fications, we notice that each approach has
looked at the phenomenon from a different angle,
either focusing on its syntactic regularity, seman-
tic and pragmatic properties, meaning composi-
tionality, surface flexibility, POS (part of speech)
category, or lexicographic relevance. What we
propose is that it is not possible to come up with
a hard and fast classification that cuts through all
levels of representation. All afore-mentioned
classifications are valid and can work parallel to
each other, instead of substituting for each other.
The assumption that we follow in this paper is
that MWEs have different classifications at dif-
ferent levels of representation from the very deep
level of semantics and pragmatics to the very
shallow level of morphology and phonetics.
The details of our annotation scheme are ex-
plained in the following section.
It is worth noting that in our current work, we
move the focus away from edited text to the
challenging and creative language found in UGC
and by trying to close the language resource gap
between edited and unedited text. We handle this
gap by focusing on dialects, the language used in
informal communications such as emails, chat
rooms, and in social media in general. We cover
the full range of MWEs (nominal, verbal, adver-
bial, adjectival and prepositional expressions) in
Egyptian Arabic, covering 7,331 MWEs (col-
lected from corpora and paper dictionaries).

A syntactic variable is a slot that intervenes be-

being itself a part of it, but fills a syntactic gap.
Syntactic variables are added, when needed, to
MWEs to represent the syntactic behavior of an
MWE and they exemplify how the MWE inter-
acts with other elements within its scope. We
create a tagset of syntactic variables reflecting
the argument structure of an MWE. Examples

In the dictionary market there are specialized
dictionaries for idioms, phrasal verbs, proverbs
and quotations. However, general domain dic-
tionaries try to avoid the use of too technical
terms in the description of MWEs and use for the
sake of simplicity a general term like ‘phrase’ to
denote them to users. Yet, in the meta language
of the dictionary compiling profession, lexicog-
raphers make a more fine-grained distinction be-
tween the various types of MWEs. Our lexico-
graphic classification of MWEs is adapted from
Atkins and Rundell (2008) and includes the fol-
lowing tags. Examples are listed in Table 3.

• Quasi-phrasemes are when the meaning of
the expression matches the meaning of the
component words in addition to an extra
piece of meaning that is not directly derived
from either components, such as ﺐﻌﺸﻟاﺍﺲﻠﺠﻣ
majolis Al$aEob ‘people&apos;s assembly’.
• Semi-phrasemes are when the meaning of
the MWE is partially directly derived from
one component and partially indirectly indi-
cated by the other component, such as تﺕﺎﺳاﺍرﺭدﺩ

A scale of three levels is used to measure the de-

flexibility of a MWE, adopted from Sag et al.
(2002). The three levels are as follows:

<listItem confidence="0.99600835">
• Fixed MWE: An MWE is considered as a
fixed expression if it does not have any de-
gree of syntactic, morphological or lexical
flexibility, and its meaning cannot be pre-
dicted from its component elements, for ex-
ample, حﺡاﺍﺪﻣ حﺡاﺍﺪﺳ sadAH madAH ‘slapdash’.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999245">
We have described the annotation guidelines for
a lexical database of MWE for dialectal Arabic.
We provide descriptive specifications of MWE at
the phonological, orthographical, syntactic and
semantic levels. The main contribution of this
paper is that it is the first description of a classi-
fication and annotation scheme of a lexical data-
base for dialects, which can be extended for in-
formal languages and with direct applicability on
user-generated content.

There is critical need for studying MWEs both from the theoretical and practical point of views. MWEs have diverse categories, varying degrees of idiomaticity, different syntactic compositions, and different morphological, lexical and syntactic behavior, and dealing with them is complicated even further by the fact that there is no “watertight criteria” for distinguishing them them (Atkins and Rundell, 2008). Moreover, there is no universally-agreed taxonomy of MWEs (Ramisch, 2012), and different researchers proposed different typology for this phenomena. Fillmore et al. (1988) proposed three types based on lexical and syntactic familiarity: a) unfamiliar pieces familiarly combined, b) familiar pieces unfamiliarly combined, and c) familiar pieces familiarly combined. Mel&apos;čuk (1989), on the other hand, introduced three different classes: a) complete phraseme, b) semiphraseme, c) and quasi-phraseme.

However, general domain dictionaries try to avoid the use of too technical terms in the description of MWEs and use for the sake of simplicity a general term like ‘phrase’ to denote them to users. Yet, in the meta language of the dictionary compiling profession, lexicographers make a more fine-grained distinction between the various types of MWEs. Our lexicographic classification of MWEs is adapted from Atkins and Rundell (2008) and includes the following tags. Examples are listed in Table 3. 1. Idiom: An idiom is an MWE whose meaning is fully or partially unpredictable from the meanings of its components (Nunberg et al., 1994); 2. Support verb, or ‘light verbs’, may be defined as semantically empty verbs, which share their arguments with a noun (Meyers et al., 2004); 51 3. Prepositional verb: These are verbs followed by prepositions with impact on the meaning; 4. Compound noun: A compound noun is a lexeme that consists of more than one noun; 5. Compound term: This is a technical compound noun used in a specific tech</context>

MWEs vary in their syntactic category, morphological behavior, and degree of semantic opaqueness. MWEs are pervasively present in natural texts, which makes it imperative to tackle them explicitly if we aspire to make large-scale, linguistically-motivated, and precise processing of a human language. Integrating MWEs in NLP applications has evidently and consistently shown to improve the performance in tasks such as Information Retrieval (Acosta et al. 2011; da Silva and Souza, 2012), Text Mining (SanJuan and IbekweSanJuan, 2006), Syntactic Parsing (Eryiğit et al., 2011; Nivre and Nilsson, 2004; Attia, 2006; Korkontzelos and Manandhar, 2010), Machine Translation (Deksne, 2008; Carpuat and Diab, 2010; Ghoneim and Diab 2013; Bouamor et al., 2011), Question Answering, and Named-Entity extraction (Bu et al., 2011). In the current work, we propose guidelines for detailed linguistic annotation of an MWE lexicon for dialectal (Egyptian) Arabic that covers, among other types, expressions that are traditionally classified as idioms (e.g. L11-�i c,6 EalaY Alriyq 1 ‘on an empty stomach’), prepositional verbs (e.g. c,6 CS-4 tawak—al EalaY ‘rely on’), compound nouns (e.g. _)ssA S_)U) &lt;i$Arap mur</context>

Modern Standard Arabic equivalents and English translations, thereby rendering our resource a three-way – Egyptian Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic and English – repository for MWEs. 1 Introduction Multiword expressions (MWEs) comprise a wide range of diverse, arbitrary and yet linguistically related phenomena that share the characteristic of crossing word boundaries (Sag et al., 2002). MWEs are computationally challenging because the exact interpretation of an MWE is not directly obtained from its component parts. MWEs are intrinsically single units on the deep conceptual and semantic levels, but on the surface (lexical and syntactic) levels they are expressed as multiple units. MWEs vary in their syntactic category, morphological behavior, and degree of semantic opaqueness. MWEs are pervasively present in natural texts, which makes it imperative to tackle them explicitly if we aspire to make large-scale, linguistically-motivated, and precise processing of a human language</context>

A significant amount of research has focused on the identification and extraction of MWEs (Ramisch et al., 2010; Dubre</context>

Social media have empowered users to be more creative and interactive, and allowed them to 49 voice their opinions on events and products and exert powerful influence on the behavior and opinion of others. Yet, the current overflow of UGC poses significant challenges in data gathering, annotation and presentation. 3 MWE Taxonomy Although the importance of the MWEs has been acknowledged by many researchers in the field of NLP as evident by the large number of research papers and dedicated workshops in the past decade, the theory of MWEs is still underdeveloped (Sag et al., 2002). There is critical need for studying MWEs both from the theoretical and practical point of views. MWEs have diverse categories, varying degrees of idiomaticity, different syntactic compositions, and different morphological, lexical and syntactic behavior, and dealing with them is complicated even further by the fact that there is no “watertight criteria” for distinguishing them them (Atkins and Rundell, 2008). Moreover, there is no universally-agreed taxonomy of MWEs (Ramisch, 2012), and different researchers proposed different typology for this phenomena. Fillmore et al. (1988) proposed thre</context>

(2002). The three levels are as follows: • Fixed MWE: An MWE is considered as a fixed expression if it does not have any degree of syntactic, morphological or lexical flexibility, and its meaning cannot be predicted from its component elements, for example, حﺡاﺍﺪﻣ حﺡاﺍﺪﺳ sadAH madAH ‘slapdash’. • Semi-Fixed MWE: Semi-fixed expressions allow for a certain degree of morphological and lexical variation, but they are fixed in terms of the syntactic word order, for example, ﻢھﮪﮬﻫﺮﻌﺷ \ l���� cJ- c,6 cel-o\aﯿﻴﺷlﻣ mA$oyap/mA$oyiyn EalaY Hal— $aEorahA/$aEoruhum [lit. living by letting down her/their hair] ‘w</context>

Until now, this is hampered by the lack of comprehensive resources for MWEs with fine-grained classification on different dimensions related to semantic roles and syntactic functions. Arabic comprises numerous divergent dialects, and having an annotated MWE lexical resource in dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) will allow for studying transformation, change and development in this language. From a theoretical linguistic point of view, our work will be interesting particularly in studies related to Diglossia. Diglossia (Walters, 1996) is where two languages or dialects exist side by side within a community, where typically one is used in formal contexts while the other is used in informal communications and interactions. Studying the MWE space for dialects and MSA as a continuum will lead to deeper insights into variations as we note intersection and overlap between the two. In many instances, we see that MSA MWEs and their dialectal equivalents are not necessarily shared as they occupy complementary linguistic spaces. However, the nature of this complementarity and its cultural and social implications will need more explo</context>

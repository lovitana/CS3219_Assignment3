<bodyText confidence="0.999844">
In modern time a lot of
connections developed among
various nations, and people
became acquainted with several
languages. New conceptions
move from their origin in a
certain language to another
surrounding. Hebrew also
adopted many new words from
foreign origin, but there is a
difficulty to adopt foreign verbs
in Hebrew, since a Hebrew verb
must be in a certain pattern. This
short paper explains how a
special device has developed in
the Hebrew grammar to cope
with this need.

1 Hebrew words in array
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99976375">
Most Hebrew words are arranged in a &amp;quot;root
pattern array&amp;quot;. Each line contains a root,
which is a sequence of three or more
consonants, and each column contains a
pattern built as a sequence of vowels,
sometimes accompanied by one consonant
or two. Each pattern also contains three or
four slots in which the consonants of the
root should enter (Figure 1).
Thus a word appears in each square
containing the consonants of the root
interwoven into the pattern (Figure 2). There
are several thousands roots, and 100 – 120
patterns of nouns but only seven patterns of
verbs. Nouns may be of foreign origins, but
verbs should be in the seven patterns only.

2 Empty squares for innovations
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999772111111111">
Many squares in the array are actually
empty. They may become full if new
words are needed to be introduced into
the language. Usually it happens if a speaker
does not find a word that expresses his/her
idea. He/She chooses a proper root, and by
looking for proper pattern, a new word is
produced and from here it shifts into the
dictionary (described in Figure 2).

3 Verbal and nominal expressions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994267444444444">
Languages have both verbal and nominal
expressions. Speakers sometimes need both.
In order to express an idea which contains
both a noun and a verb, it is possible to use a
&amp;quot;general purpose&amp;quot; verb, which expresses a
general meaning of doing, such as do, make,
or act etc., and relate it to the noun. Here are
some expressions in Hebrew: First, general
purpose Hebrew verbs:
lip&apos;ol= to act,
le-bacce&apos; =to perform,
la-ˁsot= to do, to make.
And some examples of actual use:
la-&apos;�ot ma`amaCCim = to make efforts,
le-harim telepon = to pick up a
telephone,
lišloah mibraq = to send a telegram,
la-&apos;rok biqqur = to pay a visit.
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.955604" genericHeader="method">
4 Same root for both
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999625">
It is very common that both the verbal and
the nominal expressions be of the same root,
such as:

<bodyText confidence="0.936693565217391">
Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Social Dynamics and Personal Attributes in Social Media, pages 94–97,
Baltimore, Maryland USA, 27 June 2014. c�2014 Association for Computational Linguistics
liktob miktab = to write a letter
(root: k&apos;t&apos;b&apos; )
lsapper sippur = to tell a story
(root: s&apos;p&apos;r&apos;).
Such use of expression is specially
significant in Hebrew for a need to add an
adjective to the noun while the real meaning
is to add an adverbial description to the verb.
E.g., by the nominal phrase &amp;quot;important
decision&amp;quot; such as in Hebrew : le-hahlit
hahlata ha§uba (root: h &apos; l &apos; t &apos; ) = to decide
an important decision. Here both noun and
verb are of the same root. Sometimes the
verbal expression itself includes the idea of
the nominal expression, such as,
le-habriq = li§loh mibraq (to telegraph,
or to send a telegram),
le-hi§takker= li§tot le-§okra (to drink up
to toxication),
le-hitraggez = le-habbir rogez ( to
express anger).

5 Foreign nouns need &amp;quot;squeezing&amp;quot;
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999633875">
But what about foreign nouns? Modern
world offers a lot of contacts for speakers of
various languages, and Hebrew also got
a lot of foreign nouns from many
languages. These nouns are not included in
the array. and what is more important, they
do not have roots, while Hebrew
speakers are used to connect nouns
and verbs, preferably through common
roots. A special procedure developed in
Hebrew grammar, which produces roots
from foreign nouns. This procedure is
&amp;quot;squeezing&amp;quot;: We squeeze the noun and get
its vowels out1. What remain is its
consonants only.
This sequence of consonants is considered
to be used as a new root. The new root is put
in a new line in the list of roots at the
root-pattern array, and of course on the spot a
lot of new empty squares appear along the
line of the new root. Some of them are verbal
patterns. Now one can choose a proper
verbal pattern and here a new Hebrew
verb appears.

6 Root is sequence of consonants
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.958346388888889">
For example, a new instrument is invented
somewhere in a foreign country and has been
brought to the Hebrew speakers together
with its name: It is the telephone. We have
mentioned it above in the first appearance in
the idiom le-harim telepon, but sometimes
after that we find another word which
conveys the same meaning, i.e., le-talpen =
to phone. This verb may appear of course in
various verbal structures, such as
tilpanti = I phoned,
talpenu elay = please phone me, etc.
The verb appeared as a result of the
squeezing process. From telephone we got the
sequence of consonants t l p n . and that was
enough to add a new line in the root lines of
the root-pattern array. ( [p] and [f] relate to the
same phoneme /p/ even in Modern Hebrew.)
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.921671" genericHeader="method">
7 Squeezing is original procedure
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999904875">
This procedure of squeezing has been active
even in ancient times. It can be seen in the
Greek word which entered into Hebrew as
well as to many languages – basis. We have a
Hebrew verb based on the root b s s , which
was squeezed from basis in ancient time and
is being used since Mishnaic Hebrew until
modern time.

8 Squeezing in Hebrew increased
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9451941">
In Modern time squeezing seems to increase.
Many new ideas appeared in the wide world,
and Hebrew did not stay behind. Beside other
ways of innovation of new words from wide
world origin, we find a lot of new words,
especially verbs, which have been coined by
squeezing. See for example what happened to
English words such as compilation, debug,
format, fax, discuss, Pascal, Pasteur, Rentgen.
They all passed through squeezing, even if
some of them are not necessarily nouns. For
example,
le-qampel = to compile (code),
le-dabbeg = to debug,
le-farmet = to format,
le-faqses= to send a fax note
le-dasqes = to discuss, to talk
le-fasqel = run a Pascal code,
le-faster = pasterize,
le-rantgen = to X-ray.

9 Squeezing of Hebrew words
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998237666666667">
Next development of the squeezing
procedure is that it began to work also on
Hebrew words. It happened whenever a
speaker feels that the old root does not
satisfy his/her needs. A good example is
the noun mispar which exists in the root-
pattern array, with the root s&apos;p&apos;r&apos; and
pattern mi—a-. Its meaning is &amp;quot;a
number&amp;quot;, and the verb sapar means &amp;quot;to
count&amp;quot;. Now what happens when you
need to express the idea of giving
numbers to a bunch of pages or names in
a long queue. The verb sapar &amp;quot;count&amp;quot; is
not proper. So the noun mispar has been
squeezed and a new root, m &apos; s &apos; p &apos; r &apos;
appeared in a new line at the array,
producing a new verb le-masper = to
give numbers. Another example is himhiz.
Its root m h z squeezed from mahze =
stage play, a noun of root h &apos; z &apos; y &apos; (The m
is from the pattern). The procedure is so
strong that even a sequence of two
adjacent words may be squeezed such
as &amp;quot;rad ka`n&amp;quot; which means &amp;quot;up to the
present&amp;quot;. This idiom was squeezed, and
we got a new root: r &apos; d &apos; k &apos; n &apos; , from
which a verb as well as an adjective
appeared:
le-radken et ha-hadašot = to update
the news, or
ha-tȉur lo` mrudkan = the
description is not uptodate.2
2 The squeezing procedure suggestion
explains the connection between verbs and
their origin much easier and nicer than the
efforts done by Outi Bat-El, 1994. She speaks
about &amp;quot;extracting&amp;quot;, which is the exact
&amp;quot;squeezing&amp;quot; described in Ornan, 1976 and
Ornan, 1990 (without mentioning them), but
tries to adopt it to another theory based on
four elements (by McCarthy 1981) which
includes adding vowels in a separate
procedure, without including any formative
consonant to a pattern, while the suggested
approach here is based on two elements
(pattern and root) only, and we include
patterns which may contain consonants.

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9997882">
We report ongoing work that is aiming to
develop a data-driven approach to text
analysis for computational social science.
The novel feature is the use of a grammar
induction algorithm to identify salient
information structures from an unannotated
text corpus. The structures provide richer
representations of text content than
keywords, by capturing patterning related to
what is written about key terms. Here we
show how information structures were
induced from texts that record political
negotiations, and how the structures were
used in analyzing relations between countries
and negotiation positions.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999986407407408">
There is a widespread need for automated text
analysis to be integrated into research methods
for computational social science (e.g. Grimmer
and Stewart, 2013). In order to analyze highly
diverse content, techniques tend to treat texts as
bags of words, e.g. for search, to summarize
content with word clouds, and to model topics.
Such techniques capture the general “aboutness”
of texts, but they do little to elucidate the actual
statements that are made about key concepts.
Conversely, structured representations of
statements can be generated, up to a point, by
information extraction systems but these are
costly to port to new languages and domains.
Thus, we are motivated to develop a portable
technique that can generate richer representations
of text content than keywords. Our idea is to
adapt and apply a grammar induction algorithm
to identify salient information structures in the
surface form of texts. It seems to us that, to the
extent that there is patterning, information
structures may be induced from an unannotated
text corpus with little or no need for language-
specific and domain-specific resources. Unlike
approaches under the rubrics of unsupervised and
open information extraction (e.g. Riloff, 1996;
Sekine, 2006; Etzioni et al., 2008), we avoid the
use of parsers, part-of-speech taggers, and pre-
specified entities for which relations are sought.
The approach that we envisage fits with the
ethos of exploratory “data-driven” research.
Rather than approaching a corpus with a
hypothesis and an a priori coding scheme, a
researcher is given an overview of the content in
terms of computationally tractable information
structures that were induced from the corpus.
Such structures map to surface forms in text and
can hence be used directly in quantitative
analyses for further exploration and to test
hypotheses, once they have been interpreted as
interesting by a researcher. Working in this way
will avoid the expense and bottleneck of manual
coding, and reduce the potential for biases.
In the following we motivate our use of the
ADIOS algorithm for grammar induction (2.1),
and introduce the Earth Negotiations Bulletin
(2.2). Section 3 describes our method and
discusses the information structures identified in
ENB texts. Section 4 takes some preliminary
steps in using these information structures to
identify dyads of (dis-) agreement and to extract
markers of quantifiable negotiation positions. In
closing, Section 5 offers some tentative
conclusions and ideas for future work.

domain-specific information structures,
especially in the “sublanguages” of specialist
domains (Harris, 1988). Whilst the textual
material typically analyzed by social scientists
may not be as restricted in content and style as
that analyzed by Harris, our work proceeds on
the assumption that, at least in some domains, it
is restricted enough such that there is sufficient
patterning for an inductive approach.
Harris’ ideas about distributional analysis have
become a cornerstone for some of the work in
the field of automated grammatical inference,
where researchers attempt to induce grammatical
structures from raw text. In this field the
emphasis is on generating complete grammatical
descriptions for text corpora in order to
understand the processes of language learning;
see D’Ulizia et al. (2011) for a review.
For example, the unsupervised ADIOS
algorithm (Solan et al., 2005) recursively induces
hierarchically structured patterns from sequential
data, e.g. sequences of words in sentences of
unannotated text, using statistical information in
the sequential data. Patterns may include
equivalence classes comprising items that share
similar distributional properties, where items
may be words or other patterns. As a toy
example of a pattern, take ‘(the (woman|man)
went to the (house|shop|pub))’, with equivalence
classes ‘(woman|man)’ and ‘(house|shop|pub)’.

2.2 The Earth Negotiations Bulletin
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996019047619">
Within political science, text corpora provide a
valuable resource for the analysis of political
struggle and structures. For international climate
negotiations, the Earth Negotiation Bulletin
(ENB) constitutes an online record of the
positions and proposals of different countries,
their agreements and disagreements, and changes
over time. As such it can provide insights into,
e.g., how institutional structures and bargaining
strategies affect policy outcomes. Since 1995,
every day of formal climate negotiations under
the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UN FCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol has
been summarized in a separate 2-4 page issue of
the ENB1. The ENB seeks to cover the major
topics of discussion and which negotiators
(referred to by country name) said what. The
publication is used by scholars to address
research questions such as whether countries
with more extreme positions have more or less
success (Weiler, 2012) and whether democracies

and autocracies (Bailer, 2012) or developed and
developing countries (Castro et al., 2014) behave
differently in negotiations. From our perspective,
the ENB’s restricted content and style makes it
appropriate to test our inductive approach.

3 Inducing Information Structures
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990333333333">
We are investigating how the ADIOS algorithm
(Solan et al., 2005) can be adapted and applied
for mining the content of unannotated corpora;
cf. Salway and Touileb (2014). Our objective of
identifying salient information structures, rather
than generating a complete grammatical
description, leads us to modify the learning
regime of ADIOS. Firstly, we modify the way in
which text is presented to ADIOS by presenting
sentences containing terms of interest (for the
ENB texts these were country names), rather
than processing all sentences: we expect more
relevant patterning in these sentences, and think
the patterning will be more explicit if not diluted
by the rest of the corpus. Secondly, as described
in more detail below, we focus the algorithm on
frequent structures through an iterative process
of selection and substitution.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998094">
3.1 Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999856115384615">
Our data set comprised all texts from the ENB
volume 12, numbers 1-594, which cover the
period 1995-2013. Preprocessing involved
removing boilerplate text, sentence
segmentation, and making all text lowercase.
Then, all sentences mentioning one or more
countries were selected. Every mention of a
country, or a list of countries, was replaced with
the token ‘COUNTRY’: this serves to make
patterning around mentions of countries more
explicit. A list of country names was the only
domain- and language-specific resource required
for the processing described below.
The resulting file of 32,288 sentences was
processed by an implementation of the ADIOS
algorithm, in which we modified the original
learning regime to bias it towards frequent
structures. After one execution of ADIOS we
selected the five most frequent patterns (and any
patterns contained within them) and replaced all
instances of them in the input file with a unique
identifier for each pattern: as with the
‘COUNTRY’ token, we believe that this serves
to make relevant patterning more explicit. We
executed ADIOS and selected and substituted
frequent patterns nine more times.

3.2 Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999947524590164">
In this way 53 patterns were identified, some of
which are shown in Table 1 (patterns 1-7). Here
patterns and equivalence classes are bracketed
and nested. The sequential items in a pattern are
separated by whitespace and the alternative items
in an equivalence class are separated by ‘|’.
‘COUNTRY’ stands for a mention of a country,
or a list of countries. In some cases we have
manually merged and simplified patterns for
clarity, but the structuring that they describe was
all induced automatically.
Pattern 1 captures a simple relation between
countries that appears frequently in sentences
like ‘China supported by Saudi Arabia said...’. It
could thus be used as a simple template for
extracting data about how countries align with
one another (see section 4.1). Patterns 2-4
represent a multitude of ways in which a
country’s stated positions on issues can be
reported. These patterns do not describe the
issues, but could be used as cues to locate text
fragments that do, e.g. by taking the text that
follows ‘COUNTRY said|noted|recommended|
(etc.)...’ (see section 4.2). Patterns 5 and 6
appear to have captured a wide variety of verbs
and noun phrases respectively. Presumably these
verbs relate to things that countries say that they
will do, or that they think should be done. The
noun phrases appear to raise topics for
discussion; consider how pattern 6 appears as
part of 7. There were other patterns that did not
contain any equivalence classes: these often
captured domain terminology, e.g. ‘(developing
countries)’, ‘(commitment period)’.
Patterns 1-6 all have a relatively shallow
structure. In order to induce further structure we
made new input files, based on what we saw in
the initial patterns. We chose the most frequent
‘speech acts’ from patterns 2-4, and for each one
made a separate file containing only sentences
that contained ‘COUNTRY SPEECH_ACT’, e.g.
one file that contained all the sentences matching
‘COUNTRY expressed’. Each speech act file
was processed with 10 iterations of selection and
substitution (cf. section 3.1). The resulting
patterns, including 8-10 in Table 1, do indeed
have richer structures and show in a more
nuanced way how countries’ positions are
reported in the ENB texts.
These results are encouraging for the idea of
inducing information structures from an
unannotated text corpus. The examples shown in
Table 1 would not surprise anybody who was
familiar with the ENB material. However, they
provide a useful summary view of what is
typically written about countries. Further, since
they relate directly to surface forms in the text,
they may be valuable for guiding further
quantitative analyses, e.g. by pinpointing where
significant expressions of country positions,
arguments and affinities are to be found.

<bodyText confidence="0.999924705882353">
The pattern ‘(COUNTRY ((supported|opposed)
by) COUNTRY)’, cf. Table 1, was used as a
regular expression to extract instances where
relations between countries were recorded with
respect to stated positions. This gave 1145
instances of support, and 592 of opposition, often
involving multiple countries; recall that
‘COUNTRY’ may stand for a list of countries. A
count was made for each pair of countries in
support and opposition, with a distinction made
between ‘C1 supported by C2’ and ‘C2
supported by C1’. Figure 1 is a scatterplot made
from these counts. It shows, for example, that the
US very often finds its statements supported by
Canada. Further, whilst the US tends to support
the EU relatively often, the EU supports the US
only about as often as it opposes the US.

4.2 Scaling negotiation positions
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9983555">
Patterns 2-4 from Table 1 were combined into a
regular expression to extract instances of the
statements made by countries. For each country a
file was made with the text following every
instance of ‘COUNTRY said  |noted |
recommended  |(etc.)’, until the end of the
sentence. The collection of country files was then
analyzed with Wordfish (Slapin and Proksch,
2008): this tool, which implements a scaling
model, positions texts (here reflecting countries)
on a political/ideological dimension based on the
relative frequency of discriminating words.
For the 40 countries with the most statements,
the parameter indicating country position on the
induced dimension ranged in ascending order
from Austria (-2.38) via Belgium, Germany, the
UK, Switzerland, the US, Canada, Australia,
Norway, France, Russia, New Zealand to Japan
(-.62) and on to Papua New Guinea (-.26),
Tuvalu, Peru, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina,
Malaysia, South Korea, Colombia, Saudi Arabia,
Chile, Kuwait, Nigeria, Grenada, Uganda,
Bangladesh, China, Egypt, the Philippines, South
Africa, Indonesia, Venezuela, Iran, Bolivia,
Barbados, India and Algeria (1.44).
The method thus perfectly identifies the main
cleavage in international climate negotiations
between developed and developing countries (cf.
Castro et al., 2014). The bifurcation is robust to
alternative specifications. Among the ten most
discriminating lemmas used by developing
countries are ‘equal’, ‘distribut’, ‘resourc’,
‘histor’, and ‘equiti’, suggesting an emphasis on
fairness and rich countries’ historical emissions.

5 Closing Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985285714286">
The novel use of a grammar induction algorithm
was successful in elucidating the content of a
corpus in a complementary way to bag-of-words
techniques: some of the induced structures were
useful for guiding subsequent analyses as part of
a data-driven approach to computational social
science. Specifically, in this case, the structures
facilitated text analysis at the statement level, i.e.
statements about country relations and countries’
positions. This meant we could plot country
relations and scale country positions even though
our source texts were not organized by country.
Given its inherent portability, we see the
potential for applying the grammar induction
approach to many other corpora, most obviously
the other 32 ENB volumes, and other texts with
similarly restricted content and style, e.g.
parliamentary proceedings. It remains a largely
open question as to what happens when the text
input becomes more heterogeneous, but see
Salway and Touileb (2014) regarding the
processing of blog posts.
In ongoing work we are seeking to understand
more about how the parameters of the ADIOS
algorithm, and the modifications we make, affect
the set of structures that it identifies. Also we are
considering evaluation metrics to validate the
induced patterns and to measure recall.

The structures provide richer representations of text content than keywords, by capturing patterning related to what is written about key terms. Here we show how information structures were induced from texts that record political negotiations, and how the structures were used in analyzing relations between countries and negotiation positions. 1 Introduction There is a widespread need for automated text analysis to be integrated into research methods for computational social science (e.g. Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). In order to analyze highly diverse content, techniques tend to treat texts as bags of words, e.g. for search, to summarize content with word clouds, and to model topics. Such techniques capture the general “aboutness” of texts, but they do little to elucidate the actual statements that are made about key concepts. Conversely, structured representations of statements can be generated, up to a point, by information extraction systems but these are costly to port to new languages and domains. Thus, we are motivated to develop a portable technique that can generate richer representations of text</context>

In the following we motivate our use of the ADIOS algorithm for grammar induction (2.1), and introduce the Earth Negotiations Bulletin (2.2). Section 3 describes our method and discusses the information structures identified in ENB texts. Section 4 takes some preliminary steps in using these information structures to identify dyads of (dis-) agreement and to extract markers of quantifiable negotiation positions. In closing, Section 5 offers some tentative conclusions and ideas for future work. 2 Background 2.1 Grammar induction for text mining Harris (1954; 1988) demonstrated how linguistic units and structures can be identified manually through a distributional analysis of partially aligned sentential contexts.

Our idea is to adapt and apply a grammar induction algorithm to identify salient information structures in the surface form of texts.

Unlike approaches under the rubrics of unsupervised and open information extraction (e.g. Riloff, 1996; Sekine, 2006; Etzioni et al., 2008), we avoid the use of parsers, part-of-speech taggers, and prespecified entities for which relations are sought. The approach that we envisage fits with the ethos of exploratory “data-driven” research.

Firstly, we modify the way in which text is presented to ADIOS by presenting sentences containing terms of interest (for the ENB texts these were country names), rather than processing all sentences: we expect more relevant patterning in these sentences, and think the patterning will be more explicit if not diluted by the rest of the corpus.

This meant we could plot country relations and scale country positions even though our source texts were not organized by country. Given its inherent portability, we see the potential for applying the grammar induction approach to many other corpora, most obviously the other 32 ENB volumes, and other texts with similarly restricted content and style, e.g. parliamentary proceedings. It remains a largely open question as to what happens when the text input becomes more heterogeneous, but see Salway and Touileb (2014) regarding the processing of blog posts. In ongoing work we are seeking to understand more about how the parameters of the ADIOS algorithm, and the modifications we make, affect the set of structures that it identifies. Also we are considering evaluation metrics to validate the induced patterns and to measure recall. 31 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to Zach Solan for providing an implementation of the ADIOS algorithm, and to Knut Hofland for his help in creating our corpus of ENB texts.

In this field the emphasis is on generating complete grammatical descriptions for text corpora in order to understand the processes of language learning; see D’Ulizia et al. (2011) for a review. For example, the unsupervised ADIOS algorithm (Solan et al., 2005) recursively induces hierarchically structured patterns from sequential data, e.g. sequences of words in sentences of unannotated text, using statistical information in the sequential data. Patterns may include equivalence classes comprising items that share similar distributional properties, where items may be words or other patterns. As a toy example of a pattern, take ‘(the (woman|man) went to the (house|shop|pub))’, with equivalence classes ‘(woman|man)’ and ‘(house|shop|pub)’. 2.2 The Earth Negotiations Bulletin Within political science, text corpora provide a valuable resource for the an</context>

In this paper, we present preliminary re-
sults obtained using a system based on co-
occurrence of drug-effect pairs as a first
step in the study of detecting adverse drug
reactions and drug indications from social
media texts. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first work that extracts
this kind of relationships from user mes-
sages that were collected from an online
Spanish health-forum. In addition, we also
describe the automatic construction of the
first Spanish database for drug indications
and adverse drug reactions.

<bodyText confidence="0.99995925862069">
The activity of Pharmacovigilance (science de-
voted to the detection and prevention of any possi-
ble drug-related problem, including adverse drug
effects) has gained significant importance in the
recent decades, due to the growing number of drug
safety incidents (Bond and Raehl, 2006) as well as
to their high associated costs (van Der Hooft et al.,
2006).
Nowadays, the major medicine regulatory agen-
cies such as the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) are working to create policies and prac-
tices to facilitate the reporting of adverse drug re-
actions (ADRs) by healthcare professionals and
patients. However, several studies have shown that
ADRs are under-estimated because many health-
care professionals do not have enough time to use
the ADR reporting systems (Bates et al., 2003;
van Der Hooft et al., 2006; McClellan, 2007) .
In addition, healthcare professionals tend to re-
port only those ADRs on which they have abso-
lute certainty of their existence. Unlike reports
from healthcare professionals, patient reports of-
ten provide more detailed and explicit information
about ADRs (Herxheimer et al., 2010). Neverthe-
less, the rate of ADRs reported by patients is still
very low probably because many patients are still
unaware of the existence of ADR reporting sys-
tems. In addition, patients may feel embarrassed
when describing their symptoms.
In this paper, we pose the hypothesis that
health-related social media can be used as a com-
plementary data source to the ADR reporting sys-
tems. In particular, health forums contain a large
number of comments describing patient experi-
ences that would be a fertile source of data to de-
tect unknown ADRs.
Several systems have been developed for ex-
tracting ADRs from social media (Leaman et al.,
2010; Nikfarjam and Gonzalez, 2011). However
to the best of our knowledge, only one work in the
literature has focused on the detection of ADRs
from social media in Spanish (Segura-Bedmar et
al., 2014). Indeed, it is only concerned with the
detection of mentions of drugs and their effects,
without dealing with the extraction of the relation-
ships between them. In this paper, we extend this
existing work in order to extract drug indications
and adverse drug reactions from user comments in
a Spanish health-forum.
The remaining of this paper is structured as fol-
lows: the next section surveys related work on
ADR detection from social media. Section 3 de-
scribes the creation of a gold-standard corpus we
used for our experiments. Sections 4 and 5 re-
spectively describe the techniques employed and
their results. Lastly, some conclusive remarks and
future perspectives are given in Section 6.

2013; Li et al., 2013; Kuhn et al., 2010; Fung et al.,
2013), biomedical literature (Xu and Wang, 2013),
medical case reports (Gurulingappa et al., 2012)
and health records (Friedman, 2009; Sohn et al.,
2011). However, as it will be described below, the
extraction of these drug relationships from social
media has received much less attention.
To date, most of research on drug name recogni-
tion concerns either biomedical literature (Segura-
Bedmar et al., 2013; Krallinger et al., 2013) or
clinical records (Uzuner et al., 2010), thus leaving
unexplored this task in social media texts.
To our knowledge, there is no work in the lit-
erature that addresses the extraction of drug in-
dications from social media texts. Regarding the
detection of ADRs, Leaman et al., (2010) devel-
oped a system to automatically recognize adverse
effects in user comments from the DailyStrength1
health-related social network. A corpus of 3,600
comments was manually annotated with a total
of 1,866 drug conditions, including beneficial ef-
fects, adverse effects, indications and others. This
study focused only on a set of four drugs, and
thereby, drug name recognition was not addressed.
The system used a dictionary-based approach to
identify adverse effects and a set of keywords in
order to distinguish adverse effects from the other
drug conditions. The dictionary consisted of 4,201
concepts, which were collected from several re-
sources such as the COSTART vocabulary (FDA,
1970), the SIDER database (Kuhn et al., 2010),
the MedEffect database 2 and a list of colloquial
phrases manually collected from the comments.
The system achieved a precision of 78.3% and a
recall of 69.9% (an f-measure of 73.9%).
Later, Nikfarjam and Gonzalez (2011) applied
association rule mining to extract frequent pat-
terns describing opinions about drugs. The rules
were generated using the Apriori tool, an imple-
mentation of the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal et al.,
1994) for association rule mining. The main ad-
vantage of this approach over the dictionary based
approach is that the system is able to detect terms
not included in the dictionary. The results of this
study were 70.01% precision and 66.32% recall,
for an f-measure of 67.96%.
Benton et al.,(2011) collected a lexicon of lay
medical terms from websites and databases about
drugs and their adverse effects to identify drug ef-

fects. Then, the authors applied the Fishers exact
test (Fisher, 1922) to find all the drug-effect pairs
that co-occurred independently by chance in a cor-
pus of user comments. To evaluate the system, the
authors focused only on the four most commonly
used drugs to treat breast cancer. Precision and
recall were calculated by comparing the adverse
effects from their drug labels and the adverse ef-
fects obtained by the system. The system obtained
an average precision of 77% and an average recall
of 35.1% for all four drugs.
To the best of our knowledge, the system de-
scribed in (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014) is the only
one that has dealt with the detection of drugs and
their effects from Spanish social media streams.
The system used the Textalytics tool3, which fol-
lows a dictionary-based approach to identify en-
tities in texts. The dictionary was constructed
based on the following resources: CIMA4 and
MedDRA5. CIMA is an online information center
maintained by the Spanish Agency for Medicines
and Health Products (AEMPS). CIMA provides
information on all drugs authorized in Spain,
though it does not include drugs approved only in
Latin America. CIMA contains a total of 16,418
brand drugs and 2,228 generic drugs. Many brand
drugs have very long names because they include
additional information such as dosages, mode and
route of administration, laboratory, among oth-
ers (for example, ESPIDIFEN 400 mg GRANU-
LADO PARA SOLUCION ORAL SABOR ALBARI-
COQUE). For this reason, brand drug names were
simplified before being included in the dictionary.
After removing the additional information, the re-
sulting list of brand drug names consisted of 3,662
terms. Thus, the dictionary contained a total of
5,890 drugs. As regards to the effects, the au-
thors decided to use MedDRA, a medical multi-
lingual terminology dictionary about events asso-
ciated with drugs. MedDRA is composed of a five
levels hierarchy. A total of 72,072 terms from the
most specific level, ”Lowest Level Terms” (LLTs),
were integrated into the dictionary. In addition,
several gazetteers including drugs and effects were
collected from websites such as Vademecum6, a
Spanish online website that provides information
to patients on drugs and their side effects, and

the ATC system7, a classification system of drugs.
Thus, the dictionary and the two gazetteers con-
tained a total of 7,593 drugs and 74,865 effects.
The system yielded a precision of 87% for drugs
and 85% for effects, and a recall of 80% for drugs
and 56% for effects.

3 The SpanishADR corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997865">
Segura-Bedmar et al., (2014) created the first
Spanish corpus of user comments annotated with
drugs and their effects. The corpus consists of
400 comments, which were gathered from Fo-
rumClinic8, an interactive health social platform,
where patients exchange information about their
diseases and their treatments. The texts were man-
ually annotated by two annotators with expertise
in Pharmacovigilance. All the mentions of drugs
and effects were annotated, even those contain-
ing spelling or grammatical errors (for example,
hemorrajia (haemorrhage)). An assessment of the
inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was based on the
F-measure metric, which approximates the kappa
coefficient (Cohen, 1960) when the number of true
negatives (TN) is very large (Hripcsak and Roth-
schild, 2005). This assessment revealed that while
drugs showed a high IAA (0.89), their effects point
to moderate agreement (0.59). This may be due
to drugs have specific names and there are a lim-
ited number of them, however their effects are ex-
pressed by patients in many different ways due to
the variability and richness of natural language.
The corpus is available for academic purposes9.
In this paper, we extend the Spanish corpus to
incorporate the annotation of the relationships be-
tween drugs and their effects. In particular, we
annotated drug indications and adverse drug reac-
tions. These relationships were annotated at com-
ment level rather than sentence level, because de-
termining sentence boundaries in this kind of texts
can be problematic since many users often write
ungrammatical sentences. Guidelines were cre-
ated by two annotators (A1, A2) and a third an-
notator (A3) was trained on the annotation guide-
lines. Then, we split the corpus in three subsets,
and each subset was annotated by one annotator.
Finally, IAA was measured using kappa-statistic
on a sample of 97 documents randomly selected.
These documents were annotated by the three an-

notators and annotation differences were analysed.
As Table 1 shows, the resulting corpus has 61
drug indications and 103 adverse drug reactions.
The average size of a comment is 72 tokens. The
average size of a text fragment describing a drug
indication is 34.7 tokens and 28.2 tokens for ad-
verse drug reactions.

As it is shown in Table 2, the IAA figures clearly
suggest that the annotators have high agreement
among them. We think that the IAA figures were
lower with the third annotator because he did not
participate in the guidelines development process,
and maybe, he was not trained well enough to per-
form the task. The main source of disagreement
among the annotators could arise from consider-
ing whether a term refers to a drug effect or not.
This is due to some terms are too general (such as
trastorno (upset), enfermedad (disease), molestia
(ache)). The annotators A1 and A2, in general,
ruled out all the relation instances where these
general terms occur, however they were consid-
ered and annotated by the third annotator.

In this contribution, some refinements to the sys-
tem (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014) are proposed.
The error analysis performed in (Segura-Bedmar
et al., 2014) showed that most of false positives
for drug effects were mainly due to the inclu-
sion of MedDRA terms referring to procedures
and tests in the dictionary. MedDRA includes
terms for diseases, signs, abnormalities, proce-
dures and tests. Therefore, we decided not to in-
clude terms corresponding to the ”Procedimientos

m´edicos y quir´urgicos” and ”Exploraciones com-
plementarias” categories since they do not repre-
sent drug effects. Thus, we created a new dic-
tionary that only includes those terms from Med-
DRA that actually refer to drug effects. As in the
system (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014), we applied
the Textalytics tool, which follows a dictionary-
based approach, to identify drugs and their ef-
fects occurring in the messages. We created a
GATE10 pipeline application integrating the Tex-
talytic module and the gazetteers collected from
the Vademecum website and the ATC system pro-
posed in (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014).
In addition, we created an additional gazetteer
in order to increase the coverage. We developed a
web crawler to browse and download pages related
to drugs from the MedLinePlus website11. Un-
like Vademecum, which only contains information
for drugs approved in Spain, MedLinePlus also
includes information about drugs only approved
in Latin America. Terms describing drug effects
were extracted by regular expressions from these
pages and then were incorporated into a gazetteer.
Then, the new gazetteer was also integrated into
the GATE pipeline application to identify drugs
and effects. Several experiments with different
settings of this pipeline are described in the fol-
lowing section.
The main contribution of this paper is to pro-
pose an approach for detecting relationships be-
tween drugs and their effects from user comments
in Spanish. The main difficulty in this task is that
although there are several English databases such
as SIDER or MedEffect with information about
drugs and their side effects, none of them are avail-
able for Spanish. Moreover, these resources do
not include drug indications. Thus, we have au-
tomatically built the first database, SpanishDrug-
EffectBD, with information about drugs, their drug
indications as well as their adverse drug reactions
in Spanish. Our first step was to populate the
database with all drugs and effects from our dic-
tionary. Figure 1 shows the database schema.
Active ingredients are saved into the Drug ta-
ble, and their synonyms and brand names into the
DrugSynset table. Likewise, concepts from Med-
DRA are saved into the Effect table and their syn-
onyms are saved into the EffectSynset table. As
it is shown in Figure 1, the database is also de-

signed to store external ids from other databases.
Thus, drugs and effects can be linked to external
databases by the tables has externalIDDrug and
has externalIDDrug, respectively.
To obtain the relationships between drugs
and their effects, we developed several web
crawlers in order to gather sections describing
drug indications and adverse drug reactions from
drug package leaflets contained in the follow-
ing websites: MedLinePlus, Prospectos.Net12 and
Prospectos.org13. Once these sections were down-
loaded, their texts were processed using the Text-
Alyticis tool to recognize drugs and their effects.
As each section (describing drug indications or ad-
verse drug effects) is linked to one drug, we de-
cided to consider the effects contained in the sec-
tion as possible relationships with this drug. The
type of relationship depends on the type of section:
drug indication or adverse drug reaction. Thus for
example, a pair (drug, effect) from a section de-
scribing drug indications is saved into the DrugEf-
fect table as a drug indication relationship, while if
the pair is obtained from a section describing ad-
verse drug reactions, then it is saved as an adverse
drug reaction. This database can be used to au-
tomatically identify drug indications and adverse
drug reactions from texts. Table 3 shows the num-
ber of drugs, effects and their relationships stored
into the database.

As regards to the extraction of the relationships
between drugs and their effects occurring in the

5 Experiments
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999964782608696">
Several experiments have been performed in order
to evaluate the contribution of the proposed meth-
ods and resources. Table 4 shows the results for
the named entity recognition task of drugs and ef-
fects using the dictionary integrated into the Tex-
tAlytic tool. The first row shows the results with
the dictionary built from the CIMA and MedDRA
resources, while the second one shows the results
obtained using the new dictionary in which those
MedDRA terms corresponding to ”Procedimien-
tos m´edicos y quir´urgicos” and ”Exploraciones
complementarias” categories were ruled out. As
it can be seen in this table, the new dictionary per-
mits to obtain a significant improvement with re-
spect to the original dictionary. For effect type,
precision was increased almost a 40% and re-
call a 7%. As regards to the contribution of the
gazetteers, the coverage for effects improves al-
most a 6% but with significant decrease in preci-
sion of almost 21%. Regarding to the detection of
drugs, the use of gazetteers improves slightly the
precision and achieves a significant improvement
in the recall of almost 35%.
The major cause of false negatives for drug ef-
fects was the use of colloquial expressions (such
as ’me deja ko’ (it makes me ko)) to describe an
adverse effect. These phrases are not included in
our dictionary. Another important cause was the
dictionary and gazetteers do not cover all the lex-
ical variations of a same effect (for example de-
presi´on (depression), depresivo (depress), me de-
primo (I get depressed)). In addition, many false
negatives were due to spelling mistakes (for ex-
ample hemorrajia instead of hemorragia (haemor-
rhage)) and abbreviations (depre is an abbreviation
for depresi´on (depression)).
Regarding to the results for the relation extrac-
tion task, Table 5 shows the overall results ob-
tained using a baseline system, which considers
all pairs (drug, effect) occurring in messages as
positive relation instances, and a second approach
using the SpanishDrugEffectBD database (a rela-
tion instance is positive only if it is found into the
database). In both experiments, a window size of
250 tokens was used. The database provides a high
precision but with a very low recall of only 15%.

adverse drug reactions and drug indications from
social media streams. Results show that there is
still much room for improvement in the identifica-
tion of drugs and effects, as well as in the extrac-
tion of drug indications and adverse drug rections.
As it was already mentioned in Section 2, the
recognition of drugs in social media texts has
hardly been tackled since most systems were fo-
cused on a given and fixed set of drugs. Moreover,
little research has been conducted to extract rela-
tionships between drugs and their effects from so-
cial media. Most systems for extracting ADRs fol-
low a dictionary-based approach. The main draw-
back of these systems is that they fail to recog-
nize terms which are not included in the dictio-
nary. In addition, the dictionary-based approach
is not able to handle the large number of spelling
and grammar errors in social media texts. More-
over, the detection of ADRs and drug indications
has not been attempted for languages other than
English. Indeed, automatic information extraction
from Spanish-language social media in the field of
health remains largely unexplored.
Social media texts pose additional challenges
to those associated with the processing of clin-
ical records and medical literature. These new
challenges include the management of meta-
information included in the text (for example as
tags in tweets)(Bouillot et al., 2013), the detection
of typos and unconventional spelling, word short-

and slang and emoticons (Balahur, 2013), among
others. Another challenge that should be taken
into account is that while clinical records and med-
ical literature can be mapped to terminological re-
sources or biomedical ontologies, lay terminology
used by patients to describe their treatments and
their effects, in general, is not collected in any ter-
minological resource, which would facilitate the
automatic processing of this kind of texts.
In this paper, we also describe the automatic
creation of a database for drug indications and ad-
verse drug reactions from drug package leaflets.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
database available for Spanish. Although the use
of this database did not improve the results due
to its limited coverage, we think that the database
could be a valuable resource for future efforts.
Thus, we plan to translate the database into an on-
tology and to populate it with more entities and re-
lationships. As future work, we plan the following
tasks:

<listItem confidence="0.909135">
• To create a lexicon containing idiomatic ex-
pressions used by patients to express drug ef-
fects.
• To use techniques such as lemmatization and
stemming to cope with the problem of lexical
variability and to resolve abbreviations.
• To integrate advanced matching methods ca-
pable of dealing with the spelling error prob-
lem.
• To increase the size of the corpus.
• To apply a SVM classification approach to
extract relationships between drugs and their
effects.

We hope our research will be beneficial to
AEMPS as well as to the pharmaceutical indus-
try in the improvement of their pharmacovigilance
systems. Both the corpus and the database are
freely available online14 for research purposes.

Nowadays, the major medicine regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are working to create policies and practices to facilitate the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by healthcare professionals and patients. However, several studies have shown that ADRs are under-estimated because many healthcare professionals do not have enough time to use the ADR reporting systems (Bates et al., 2003; van Der Hooft et al., 2006; McClellan, 2007) . In addition, healthcare professionals tend to report only those ADRs on which they have absolute certainty of their existence. Unlike reports from healthcare professionals, patient reports often provide more detailed and explicit information about ADRs (Herxheimer et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the rate of ADRs reported by patients is still very low probably because many patients are still unaware of the existence of ADR reporting systems. In addition, patients may feel embarrassed when describing their symptoms. In this paper, we pose the hypothe</context>

Nowadays, the major medicine regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are working to create policies and practices to facilitate the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by healthcare professionals and patients.

The corpus consists of 400 comments, which were gathered from ForumClinic8, an interactive health social platform, where patients exchange information about their diseases and their treatments. The texts were manually annotated by two annotators with expertise in Pharmacovigilance. All the mentions of drugs and effects were annotated, even those containing spelling or grammatical errors (for example, hemorrajia (haemorrhage)). An assessment of the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was based on the F-measure metric, which approximates the kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) when the number of true negatives (TN) is very large (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005). This assessment revealed that while drugs showed a high IAA (0.89), their effects point to moderate agreement (0.59). This may be due to drugs have specific names and there are a limited number of them, however their effects are expressed by patients in many different ways due to the variability and richness of natural language. The corpus is available for academic purposes9. In this paper, we extend the Spanish corpus to incorporate the annotation of the relationships between drugs and their effects. In par</context>

A corpus of 3,600 comments was manually annotated with a total of 1,866 drug conditions, including beneficial effects, adverse effects, indications and others. This study focused only on a set of four drugs, and thereby, drug name recognition was not addressed. The system used a dictionary-based approach to identify adverse effects and a set of keywords in order to distinguish adverse effects from the other drug conditions. The dictionary consisted of 4,201 concepts, which were collected from several resources such as the COSTART vocabulary (FDA, 1970), the SIDER database (Kuhn et al., 2010), the MedEffect database 2 and a list of colloquial phrases manually collected from the comments. The system achieved a precision of 78.3% and a recall of 69.9% (an f-measure of 73.9%).

The texts were manually annotated by two annotators with expertise in Pharmacovigilance. All the mentions of drugs and effects were annotated, even those containing spelling or grammatical errors (for example, hemorrajia (haemorrhage)). An assessment of the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was based on the F-measure metric, which approximates the kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960) when the number of true negatives (TN) is very large (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005). This assessment revealed that while drugs showed a high IAA (0.89), their effects point to moderate agreement (0.59). This may be due to drugs have specific names and there are a limited number of them, however their effects are expressed by patients in many different ways due to the variability and richness of natural language. The corpus is available for academic purposes9. In this paper, we extend the Spanish corpus to incorporate the annotation of the relationships between drugs and their effects. In particular, we annotated drug indications and adverse drug reactions. These relationship</context>

Several systems have been developed for extracting ADRs from social media (Leaman et al., 2010; Nikfarjam and Gonzalez, 2011). However to the best of our knowledge, only one work in the literature has focused on the detection of ADRs from social media in Spanish (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014). Indeed, it is only concerned with the detection of mentions of drugs and their effects, without dealing with the extraction of the relationships between them. In this paper, we extend this existing work in order to extract drug indications and adverse drug reactions from user comments in a Spanish health-forum. The remaining of this paper is structured as follows: the next section surveys related work on ADR detection from social media. Section 3 describes the creation of a gold-standard corpus we used for our experiments. Sections 4 and 5 respectively describe the techniques employed and th</context>

Then, the authors applied the Fishers exact test (Fisher, 1922) to find all the drug-effect pairs that co-occurred independently by chance in a corpus of user comments. To evaluate the system, the authors focused only on the four most commonly used drugs to treat breast cancer. Precision and recall were calculated by comparing the adverse effects from their drug labels and the adverse effects obtained by the system. The system obtained an average precision of 77% and an average recall of 35.1% for all four drugs. To the best of our knowledge, the system described in (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014) is the only one that has dealt with the detection of drugs and their effects from Spanish social media streams. The system used the Textalytics tool3, which follows a dictionary-based approach to identify entities in texts. The dictionary was constructed based on the following resources: CIMA4 and MedDRA5. CIMA is an online information center maintained by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products (AEMPS). CIMA provides information on all drugs authorized in Spain, though it does not include drugs approved only in Latin America. CIMA contains a total of 16,418 brand drugs and 2,228</context>

Thus, the dictionary and the two gazetteers contained a total of 7,593 drugs and 74,865 effects. The system yielded a precision of 87% for drugs and 85% for effects, and a recall of 80% for drugs and 56% for effects. 3 The SpanishADR corpus Segura-Bedmar et al., (2014) created the first Spanish corpus of user comments annotated with drugs and their effects. The corpus consists of 400 comments, which were gathered from ForumClinic8, an interactive health social platform, where patients exchange information about their diseases and their treatments. The texts were manually annotated by two annotators with expertise in Pharmacovigilance. All the mentions of drugs and effects were annotated, even those containing spelling or grammatical errors (for example, hemorrajia (haemorrhage)). An assessment of the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was based on the F-measur</context>

This is due to some terms are too general (such as trastorno (upset), enfermedad (disease), molestia (ache)). The annotators A1 and A2, in general, ruled out all the relation instances where these general terms occur, however they were considered and annotated by the third annotator.

The error analysis performed in (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2014) showed that most of false positives for drug effects were mainly due to the inclusion of MedDRA terms referring to procedures and tests in the dictionary. MedDRA includes terms for diseases, signs, abnormalities, procedures and tests. Therefore, we decided not to include terms corresponding to the ”Procedimientos 100 m´edicos y quir´urgicos” and ”Exploraciones complementarias” categories since they do not represent drug effects. Thus, we created a new dictionary that only includes those terms from MedDRA that actually </context>

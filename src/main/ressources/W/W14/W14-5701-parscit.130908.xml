Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999931625">
German particle verbs are a type of multi word expression which is often compositional with
respect to a base verb. If they are compositional they tend to express the same types of semantic
arguments, but they do not necessarily express them in the same syntactic subcategorization
frame: some arguments may be expressed by differing syntactic subcategorization slots and other
arguments may be only implicit in either the base or the particle verb. In this paper we present a
method which predicts syntactic slot correspondences between syntactic slots of base and particle
verb pairs. We can show that this method can predict subcategorization slot correspondences with
a fair degree of success.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999631333333333">
In German, particle verbs (PVs) are a very frequent and productive type of multi word expression. Parti-
cle verbs, such as anstarren (to stare at) in (1-a), are built from a base verb (BV) and a particle. Similar to
other multi word expressions, German PVs may show a varying degree of compositionality with respect
to the BV and to the particle. But German PVs also have another particularity: if they are compositional,
the mapping from semantic arguments to syntactic subcategorization frames may be different between
the PV and its corresponding BV.

The events expressed with the PV anstarren in (1-a) can also be expressed with the BV starren in (1-b)
and (1-c). But while the argument Vogel or Wohnungst¨ur is expressed as an accusative object in (1-a) it
is expressed as a PP in both (1-b) and (1-c), headed by the preposition auf and zu, respectively.
Related to this phenomenon, the change in the typical subcategorization frame from the BV to the
PV can also lead to an incorporation or an addition of syntactic complements (Stiebels, 1996; L¨udeling,
2001), as illustrated by (2). The BV bellen (to bark) is strictly intransitive, while the corresponding PV
anbellen (to bark at) is transitive and takes an obligatory accusative object which expresses the person
or entity being barked at. This is a case of argument extensions in the PV with respect to its BV. The
PV anschrauben (to screw onto) displays incorporation: it can nearly never select an argument which
expresses the location onto which something is screwed, while its BV schrauben (to screw) requires the
expression of the location with a PP.

Finally, if the meaning of the PV is not compositional with respect to the BV, there are no se-
mantic correspondences between subcategorization slots of the PV and the BV. The problem of non-
compositionality is illustrated by (3) which uses the PV umbringen (to assassinate), which has a totally
different meaning from its BV bringen (to bring). A successful mapping between the subcategorization
slots of both can thus be expected to have a direct relation to the assessment of PV compositionality.
The problem we address here can be called the syntactic transfer problem: the subcategorization
frame of a BV can be mapped onto a subcategorization frame of the PV, where semantic arguments are
not necessarily realized with the same syntactic positions in both of the verbs. A good approximation
to this problem is potentially very useful in computational lexicography and other NLP tasks, such as
machine translation and information extraction. We also expect it to be helpful to assess other aspects of
German particle verbs, such as the prediction of compositionality levels.
In order to tackle the problem of argument slot matching we use a vector space model to represent dis-
tributional semantics. We expect that high distributional similarity between two given subcategorization
slots taken from a verb pair signals a correspondence of these slots in a pair of subcategorization frames.
On the contrary, we expect that low distributional similarity signals that no such correspondence can be
established. Further on, if for a given subcategorization slot, either from a BV or a PV, no matching
slot can be found in the complementary PV/BV automatically, this typically corresponds to a case of
argument incorporation or argument extension.
In short, in this paper we make the following contributions: We present a method of automatically
mapping syntactic subcategorization slots of BVs and PVs which is based on distributional semantics
and we show that this method can outperform a random baseline with a high level of success.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we present related work. Section 3 describes
our experimental setup, including the method of correspondence prediction, the elicitation of human
judgements and the evaluation. Section 4 presents the results which are then discussed in section 5.

Particle verbs have been studied from the theoretical perspective and, to a more limited extent, from the
aspect of the computational identifiability, predictability of the degree of semantic compositionality (the
transparency of their meaning with respect to the meaning of the base verb and the particle) and the
semantic classifiabilty of PVs.
For English, there is work on the automatic extraction of PVs from corpora (Baldwin and Villavicen-
cio, 2002; Baldwin, 2005; Villavicencio, 2005) and the determination of compositionality (McCarthy et
al., 2003; Baldwin et al., 2003; Bannard, 2005). To the best of our knowledge Aldinger (2004) is the
first work that studies German PVs from a corpus based perspective, with an emphasis on the syntactic
behavior and syntactic change. Schulte im Walde (2004; 2005; 2006) presents several preliminary distri-

butional studies to explore salient features at the syntax-semantics interface that determine the semantic
nearest neighbours of German PVs. Relying on the insights of those studies, Schulte im Walde (2006)
and Hartmann (2008) present preliminary experiments on modelling the subcategorization transfer of
German PVs with respect to their BVs, in order to strengthen PV-BV distributional similarity. The main
goal for them is to use transfer information in order to predict the degree of semantic compositionality
of PVs. K¨uhner and Schulte im Walde (2010) use unsupervised clustering to determine the degree of
compositionality of German PVs, via common PV-BV cluster membership. They are, again, mainly
interested in the assessment of compositionality, which is done on the basis of lexical information. They
use syntactic information, but only as a filter and for lexical heads as cooccurrence features in order
to limit the selected argument slots to certain syntactic functions. They compare different feature con-
figurations and conclude that the best results can be obtained with information stemming from direct
objects and PP-objects. The incorporation of syntactic information in the form of dependency arc labels
(concatenated with the head nouns) does not yield satisfactory results, putting the syntactic transfer prob-
lem in evidence, the problem which we address here. They conclude that an incorporation of syntactic
transfer information between BVs and PVs could possibly improve the results. In Bott and Schulte im
Walde (2014a) we present a method to assess PV compositionality without recurring to any syntactic
features, but we assume that the results of this method could be improved if additional syntactic transfer
information was incorporated.
Based on a theoretical study (Springorum, 2011) which explains particle meanings in terms of Dis-
course Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), Springorum et al. (2012) show that four classes
of PVs with the particle an can be classified automatically. They take a supervised approach using de-
cision trees. The use of decision trees also allows them to manually inspect and analyze the decisions
made by the classifier. As predictive features they use the head nouns of objects, generalized classes of
these nouns and PP types. In Bott and Schulte im Walde (2014b) we present an experiment to classify
semantic classes of PVs, based on subcategorization information stemming from both the BV and the
BV of each BV-PV pair. In this work we use the same gold standard we use here. This experiment is also
related to the one presented here in that we assume that the syntactic transfer patterns are quite stable
within semantic classes.

3 Experimental Setup
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988">
In order to test our hypothesis we selected a set of 32 PVs listed in Fleischer and Barz (2012), including
14 PVs with the particle an and 18 with the particle auf.1 We concentrated on two particles here in order
to have a small and controlled test bed which allows us to study the syntactic transfers. We selected
verbs which we considered to be highly compositional in order to be able to study the correspondence of
subcategorization slots. The set contained verbs which have argument slots which are typically realized
as different syntactic subcategorizations. The set also contained PVs which show argument incorporation
or the introduction of an additional syntactic complement with respect to their BV. We excluded verbs
which we could clearly perceive as being polysemous. This set of verbs was processed automatically
and presented to human raters, as described below. The test set can be seen in table 1. This test set
was already used in Bott and Schulte im Walde (2014b), where it was used as a gold standard for the
automatic classification of semantic classes of particle verbs, based on syntactic transfer patterns. The
subcategorization patterns listed here are the ones we expected to find, so the second and the third row
together represent the expected syntactic transfer pattern. The values given in these two columns are
a lexicographic presentation of the transfer patterns we expected to find. The task of the system was
defined as to find matches between slots from both verbs automatically. The verbs were grouped together
in classes which are both semantically similar and also expected to have a similar syntactic behaviour.
The labels in the column for the semantic class are taken from Fleischer and Barz (2012), but broken
down into more detailed classes, such as verbs of trying, gaze or sound. The latter label extensions were

the verbs listed are very rare or highly ambiguous. Since particle verbs in German are a highly productive paradigm and give
rise to many neologisms, compiling a complete list of PVs is nearly impossible.

Since we wanted to test the predictability of syntactic slot correspondences, we first had to identify
the typical elements of the subcategorization frames for both BVs and PVs. In order to do so, we
extracted all observable subcategorization patterns from a parsed corpus. Then we selected the 5 most
frequent subcategorization patterns for each verb (either BV or PV). These patterns were then broken
down into their individual elements. The simple transitive pattern, for example, contained a subject and
an accusative object. Since some subordinate structures miss overt subjects and in German all verbs have
a subject slot, we always included the subject in the representation of all verbs. The rationale behind this
method, which is based on the frequency of subcategorization patterns rather than the frequency of slots,
was that we were not interested in subcategorization slots per se, but in subcategorization patterns as a
typical representation structure in computational lexicography.
Then we built a vector space model for all possible combinations of BV-complements and PV-
complements of each BV-PV pair. The dimensions of the vector were instantiated by the head nouns
of the syntactic relation in question. The extension in each dimension is equal to the frequency of the
head noun in the relevant position. For this experiment no term weighting was applied. Table 2 shows
the strongest dimensions for the vectors corresponding to the PP-argument headed by the verbs heften (to
attach) and anheften (to attach to). The two verbs can be used in quite similar contexts with very similar
arguments. Accordingly, the two vectors are similar to each other. Although the two vectors correspond
to PP slots headed by the preposition an, it can be seen that there is a syntactic transfer from accusative to
dative case. Both vectors include head nouns expressing typical places to which things can be attached
to, such as a pin board (Pinnwand), a wall (Wand) or a board (Brett). The verb heften is frequently
found in the idiom sich an jemandes Ferse heften (to attach onseself to someone’s heels, which means
to follow someone closely), while this idiom cannot be formed with the PV anheften. For this reason the
dimension for Ferse is very strong. This example, especially the vector for anheften also shows that the
features are often sparsely represented, which presents a problem for our approach.
As a similarity measure we used the cosine distance between two vectors. A variable threshold was
applied on the cosine distance to, which serves to separate corresponding subcategorization slots from
non-corresponding ones. This is especially important for the detection of argument incorporation or
argument extension (cf. example (2)). If, for example, for a given BV slot no PV slot can be found
with a cosine value above the threshold, we interpret this as a case of argument extension. On the
other hand, a slot from a PV which cannot be match to a slot of its BV is taken to signal argument
incorporation. Among the vectors compared to each target subcategorization slot only the one with the
highest cosine value was considered as a possible correspondence. Finally, since we want to capture both
argument incorporation and argument extension, we computed correspondences for both BVs and PVs
separately. Even if this means that most slot pairs are computed twice, this allowed zero-correspondences
for slots from both verbs. It theoretically also allows for one-to-many and many-to-one matches, even
if we did not exploit them here. We excluded closed class dependencies of verbs, such as negations.
We also excluded clausal complements, because they could not be properly represented by our vector
extraction method. To get an idea of the lower bound of the outcome values, we used a select-1 baseline.
This baseline was obtained by calculating the expected precision and recall for the case that for each
subcategorization slot a matching slot from the corresponding other verb is assigned randomly.
As training data we used a lemmatized and tagged version of the SDeWaC corpus (Faaß and Eckart,
2013), a corpus of nearly 885 million words. The corpus was processed with the Mate dependency parser
(Bohnet, 2010). The output of this parser represents the syntactic complements of the verbs as labelled
arcs. In the case of nominal objects the nominal heads could be directly read of the dependent nodes and
the syntactic relation of the arc labels. In the case of PP-complements we read the nominal heads of the
nominal node which depends on the preposition which in turn depends on the verb. For the extraction of
features we could rely on the database compiled by (Scheible et al., 2013).

3.2 Human rating elicitation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991826086957">
We asked human raters to rate the same examples which the system classified automatically. Each of the
pairs of subcategorization slots described in section 3.1 was rated individually. The pairs were always
presented in the order &lt;BV-subcategorization-slot,PV-subcategorization-slot&gt; and in visual blocks cor-
responding to BV subcategorization slots. So the raters could see the possible PV subcategorization slots
in direct comparison. The order of blocks was randomized. The raters were asked to judge every pair
and rate whether or not they could correspond to a single semantic argument. They were invited to invent
example sentences, but because of the length of the annotation session they were not asked to write them
down. They were told that, as a criterion for semantic correspondence, each of the verbs in a pair should
be usable to describe at least one event or situation they could think of. One annotation example, which
did not stem from the set to be rated, was given.
Four human raters were asked to rate examples. All annotators were experts with either a linguistic
or NLP background. They were all German native speakers and none of them was otherwise involved
in the work presented in this paper. Because of the large size of the data set to be annotated we had
to distribute the set over two annotation forms and each annotation form was annotated by two raters.
Before the annotation started, one of the authors carried out the same annotation in order to estimate the
time needed for each annotation and the level of success which could be expected from the system. Also
this annotation was done blindly, without knowledge of the system output, but with a precise knowledge
of the task.
The annotation turned out to be much more difficult that we had originally expected. The annotators
described the annotation as being hard to perform. This was also reflected by inter annotator agreement;
we could only observe a fair agreement, with a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.31. The agreement between the
annotator ratings and the rating by the author was somewhat higher with a Fleiss’ Kappa score of 0.44.
Some annotators gave detailed feedback, once they had completed the annotation.

4 Results

<bodyText confidence="0.999979388888889">
Table 3 shows the results we obtained. The columns show precision, recall and the harmonic F-score
obtained by comparing the system output to the human ratings. We used a precision/recall schema
because the task can be seen as the system selecting the most likely slot correspondences from a set of all
possible correspondences. So a true positive is obtained if the system selects the same slot that a human
rater would select. False positives correspond to a slot selected by the system, which was not chosen by
the annotator and a false negative instances are those which are marked by an annotator and not chosen
by the system.2 Since there was more than one annotators and the annotations differed, we took the sum
of true and falls positives and false negatives from all annotators and calculated the scores over this sum.
The last column shows the harmonic F-score values we obtained with the annotations produced by one of
the authors. The lines represent those threshold values for which the highest precision or F-score could
be obtained. The last line represents the baseline. Since a variable threshold was applied there is a trade-
off between precision and recall. This is represented in figure 1, which displays the same information as
table 3, but in a graphical way.
As expected, the precision improves with higher thresholds, but this comes at the cost of a lower re-
call. The F-score stays relatively constant. The baseline is quite low, especially the recall. This can be
explained because the human raters were free to assign zero-correspondences (i.e. argument incorpora-
tions or argument extensions, as exemplified by the examples in (2)) or more than one correspondence
per target slot.

that correspondence between subcategorization slots can be predicted to a large degree by distributional
semantic similarity can thus be confirmed. On the other hand, the success was not as high as we initially
expected. It is surprising that the precision and recall values obtained with the annotations of the human
raters are much lower than the values obtained in the initial annotation produced by the author. The
author annotation has to be seen as overly optimistic, since it was done with a deeper understanding of the
computational task which was to be carried out by the system. Still, this annotation was done blindly. So
the big difference we observed is surprising. As already mentioned, the annotators all reported that they
found the annotation task difficult to carry out and we attribute the low agreement to this difficulty. The
fact that the agreement among different rather was also only fair (κ = 0.31) hints in the same direction. It
must be said that some annotators found the annotation task more difficult than others. Two of the raters
reported less annotation difficulty than the remaining. These two annotators were also the ones with
most annotation experience and they were both familiar with the topic of particle verbs from a theoretical
perspective. When the system output was compared to the ratings of best annotator, a maximum F-score
of 0.55 could be achieved, which is still lower than the values obtained in comparison to the author
annotation, but much higher than the average of all annotations.
Since some of the annotators gave detailed comments after the annotation was completed, we could
detect some problems, which made the annotation difficult, but also extends to the automatic matching.
For example, some base verbs have a resultative reading which do not express an agent and match the
patient with the nominal subject position. One such verb is kleben (to stick/glue) as exemplified in (4).
Accordingly among the strongest dimensions of the vector that represents the subject slot of kleben,
many nouns appear, which are typical things that stick, such as band aids (Pflaster), dough (Teig) and
blood (Blut). The closest vector to the vector for the accusative object vector of ankleben was also
the accusative object vector of kleben (cosine=0.64), but the subject vector was still relatively strong
(cosine=0.19).

The particle verb ankleben can be used to describe the same state of affairs as in (4-a), but not as in (4-b).
This is evidently a problem which is hard to solve with our approach because the correspondence of slots
from BV and PV interferes with a slot correspondence among different uses of the BV.3
Finally, we found that many of the feature vectors were sparsely instantiated. This can be seen, for
example, in the vector that represents the dative PP modifier headed by an of the verb anheften shown
in table 2. The sparsity problem could be remedied by reducing the number of dimensions with the
application of some kind of abstraction over the head nouns. For example the concepts of T¨ur (door) and
Kirchent¨ur (church door) are strongly related and could be represented in one dimension of the feature
vector. The same holds for the concepts of Pinnwand (pin board), Wand (wall) and Tafel (blackboard)
and other groups of concepts. With a certain level of abstraction over such concepts, the distance between
vectors would also be reduced in case they are sparse. This abstraction is, however, not a trivial problem
in itself. The application of lexical ontologies like WordNet (as used by e.g. Springorum et al. (2012)),
for example, has the danger of reducing the semantics of head nouns to level of abstraction which is too
high, since WordNet has only few top-level categories and few levels of conceptual inheritance.

<bodyText confidence="0.999994722222222">
We started the work described in this paper out of an interest to approach the syntactic transfer problem
of German particle verbs from a computational perspective. We wanted to know in how far the subcat-
egorization slots of a particle verb can be associated with subcategorization slots of a base verbs from
which it is derived. The information we used for this matching is based on distributional semantics. We
could show that can be done with a good degree of success. From the elicitation of human judgements
we learned that the task is also not an easy one for human raters. This also sheds some light on the
difficulty of the problem as a computational task.
The work we present here is relevant for computational lexicography. Firstly it can help relate lexical
entries of such closely related lexical items as particle verbs and the base verbs they incorporate. The
findings we made here may be also applicable to other types of multi word expressions.
In future work we would like to remedy the problem sparse vector representation with the use of
abstraction over the head-nouns which will reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector. We also
plan to see in how far an automatic clustering of particle verbs into semantic groups can strengthen the
prediction of slot correspondences under the assumption that semantically similar verbs tend to undergo
the same syntactic transfer. Finally, the problem of syntactic transfer between two elements is also
related to the predictability of the degree of compositionality between BV-PV pairs. We are especially
interested in this last problem and in future work we plan to investigate in which way subcategorization
slot matching can be used as a predictor for compositionality levels.

<abstract confidence="0.999043444444444">German particle verbs are a type of multi word expression which is often compositional with respect to a base verb. If they are compositional they tend to express the same types of semantic arguments, but they do not necessarily express them in the same syntactic subcategorization frame: some arguments may be expressed by differing syntactic subcategorization slots and other arguments may be only implicit in either the base or the particle verb. In this paper we present a method which predicts syntactic slot correspondences between syntactic slots of base and particle verb pairs. We can show that this method can predict subcategorization slot correspondences with a fair degree of success.</abstract>

In Bott and Schulte im Walde (2014b) we present an experiment to classify semantic classes of PVs, based on subcategorization information stemming from both the BV and the BV of each BV-PV pair. In this work we use the same gold standard we use here. This experiment is also related to the one presented here in that we assume that the syntactic transfer patterns are quite stable within semantic classes. 3 Experimental Setup In order to test our hypothesis we selected a set of 32 PVs listed in Fleischer and Barz (2012), including 14 PVs with the particle an and 18 with the particle auf.1 We concentrated on two particles here in order to have a small and controlled test bed which allows us to study the syntactic transfers. We selected verbs which we considered to be highly compositional in order to be able to study the correspondence of subcategorization slots. The set contained verbs which have argument slots which are typically realized as different syntactic subcategorizations. The set also contained PVs which show argument incorporation or the introduction of an additional syntactic complement with respe</context>

The subcategorization patterns listed here are the ones we expected to find, so the second and the third row together represent the expected syntactic transfer pattern. The values given in these two columns are a lexicographic presentation of the transfer patterns we expected to find. The task of the system was defined as to find matches between slots from both verbs automatically. The verbs were grouped together in classes which are both semantically similar and also expected to have a similar syntactic behaviour. The labels in the column for the semantic class are taken from Fleischer and Barz (2012), but broken down into more detailed classes, such as verbs of trying, gaze or sound. The latter label extensions were 1Fleischer and Barz list more than 100 PVs for both an and auf, but they embed this listing in a descriptive text. Some of the verbs listed are very rare or highly ambiguous. Since particle verbs in German are a highly productive paradigm and give rise to many neologisms, compiling a complete list of PVs is nearly impossible. 3 added by us.

In Bott and Schulte im Walde (2014a) we present a method to assess PV compositionality without recurring to any syntactic features, but we assume that the results of this method could be improved if additional syntactic transfer information was incorporated. Based on a theoretical study (Springorum, 2011) which explains particle meanings in terms of Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), Springorum et al. (2012) show that four classes of PVs with the particle an can be classified automatically. They take a supervised approach using decision trees. The use of decision trees also allows them to manually inspect and analyze the decisions made by the classifier. As predictive features they use the head nouns of objects, generalized classes of these nouns and PP types. In Bott and Schulte im Walde (2014b) we present an experiment to classify semantic classes of PVs, based on subcategorization information stemming from both the BV and the BV of each BV-PV pair.

For example the concepts of T¨ur (door) and Kirchent¨ur (church door) are strongly related and could be represented in one dimension of the feature vector. The same holds for the concepts of Pinnwand (pin board), Wand (wall) and Tafel (blackboard) and other groups of concepts. With a certain level of abstraction over such concepts, the distance between vectors would also be reduced in case they are sparse. This abstraction is, however, not a trivial problem in itself. The application of lexical ontologies like WordNet (as used by e.g. Springorum et al. (2012)), for example, has the danger of reducing the semantics of head nouns to level of abstraction which is too high, since WordNet has only few top-level categories and few levels of conceptual inheritance. 6 Conclusion and Outlook We started the work described in this paper out of an interest to approach the syntactic transfer problem of German particle verbs from a computational perspective. We wanted to know in how far the subcategorization slots of a particle verb can be associated with subcategorization slots of a base verbs from which it is derived.

The cat-N-nom stares at-P the apartment door-dat. The events expressed with the PV anstarren in (1-a) can also be expressed with the BV starren in (1-b) and (1-c). But while the argument Vogel or Wohnungst¨ur is expressed as an accusative object in (1-a) it is expressed as a PP in both (1-b) and (1-c), headed by the preposition auf and zu, respectively. Related to this phenomenon, the change in the typical subcategorization frame from the BV to the PV can also lead to an incorporation or an addition of syntactic complements (Stiebels, 1996; L¨udeling, 2001), as illustrated by (2). The BV bellen (to bark) is strictly intransitive, while the corresponding PV anbellen (to bark at) is transitive and takes an obligatory accusative object which expresses the person or entity being barked at. This is a case of argument extensions in the PV with respect to its BV. The PV anschrauben (to screw onto) displays incorporation: it can nearly never select an argument which expresses the location onto which something is screwed, while its BV schrauben (to screw) requires the expression of the location with a PP.

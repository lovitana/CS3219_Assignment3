of participants in European Parliament de-
bates can be automatically predicted on
the basis of the content of their speeches,

The European Parliament (EP) is the directly
elected parliamentary institution of the European
Union (EU), elected once every five years by vot-
ers from across all 28 member states. An im-
portant arena for the political activity in the EP
is the plenary sittings, the forum where all (cur-
rently 766) elected members of the European Par-
liament (MEPs) from all member states participate
in plenary debates (in all represented languages,
simultaneously translated). Our current work in-
vestigates to what extent the party affiliation of
the legislators in the plenary debates can be pre-
dicted on the basis of their speeches. More specif-
ically, the goal is to predict the party affiliation of
plenary speakers in the 6th European Parliament
(July 2004 – July 2009) on the basis of the party
affiliations of plenary speakers in the 5th Euro-
pean Parliament (July 1999 – July 2004).1 One

premise for the success of such an approach is that
differences in ideology and belief systems are re-
flected in differences in choice of words in ple-
nary debates. Another premise is that a shared be-
lief system translates to the same choice of party
group. As discussed below, systematic differences
in prediction performance in the data can be used
to reveal interesting differences in the extent to
which these premises hold for various subgroups
of MEPs. While this is further discussed in Sec-
tion 4, we first describe the data sets in some more
detail in Section 2 and present some preliminary
results in Section 3.

The debates from the 5th EP are used for train-
ing an SVM(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) multi-
class classifier2 which we then apply for predict-
ing party affiliations in the 6th EP. We do 5-fold
cross validation experiments on the 5th term for
model tuning. Data points in the model cor-
respond to speakers; participants in the debates
in the EP labeled with their political party. All
recorded speeches for a given speaker are con-
flated in a single vector. Although we can so far
only report results for models using fairly basic
feature types – various bag-of-words configura-
tions based on lemmas, stems or full word-forms –
combined with more linguistically informed ones,

lations; work is already in progress with respect
to assessing the usefulness of e.g. class-based fea-
tures drawn from unsupervised word clustering
and modeling semantic phenomena such as nega-
tion, speculation and sentiment. Large-scale ex-
perimentation with different features sets and hy-
perparameters is made possible by running ex-
periments on a large high-performance computing
(HPC) cluster.
The main political groups in the European Par-
liament during these terms were the Christian
Democratic / Conservative (EPP-ED), the Social-
Democratic (PES), the Liberal (ELDR), the Green
(V/ALE), the Socialists (GUE/NGL), and Right
(UEN). Note that experiments only focus on the
six largest political parties, excluding the smaller
and more marginal ones which are often more un-
stable or ad-hoc configurations, including inde-
pendent MEPs with various forms of Anti-EU ide-
ologies. To give an idea of class distribution, the
number of MEPs for all parties in our training set
is listed in Table 1. Our 5th EP term training set
comprises a total of 689 MEPs while our 6th term
test set comprises 818. It is worth pointing out that
in the 6th EP, roughly 75% of the data corresponds
to MEPs from the old member states while 25%
test are MEPs from the new member states. Of
the members from the old member states, roughly
53% of the MEPs are incumbents while the re-
mainders are freshmen (we return to this property
in Section 4 below).

results and foster further research, all data sets are

In addition to reporting results for the SVM classi-
fier, we also include figures for a simple majority-
class baseline approach, i.e., simply assigning all
MEPs in the test set to the largest political party,
EPP-ED. For evaluating the various approaches
we will be reporting precision (Prec), recall (Rec)
and F1 for each individual class/party, in addi-
tion to the corresponding macro-averaged scores
across all parties. Note that for one-of classifi-
cation problems like the one we are dealing with
here, micro-averaging would simply correspond to
accuracy (with Prec = Rec = F1, since the number
of false positives and false negatives would be the
same). While we also report accuracy, it is worth
bearing in mind that accuracy will overemphasize
performance on the large classes when working
with skewed class distributions like we do here.
In order to study the effects of different surface
features and classifier-tuning, we conduct a num-
ber of 5-fold cross-validation experiments on the
training data using different feature combinations,
for each empirically determining the best value
for the C-parameter (i.e., the regularization param-
eter of the SVM classifier, governing the trade-
off between training error and margin size). In
this initial experiments we trained different mod-
els with various configurations of non-normalized
tokens (i.e., observed word forms), stems, lemmas
and PoS- and dependency-disambiguated tokens
and stems. The best performing configuration so
far turns out to be the dependency disambiguated
stems with the observed optimal C-value of 0.8,
with F1 over two percentage points higher than
the model trained on stems alone at the same C-

that linguistically informed features do provide the
model with relevant information.
Results obtained by applying the best-
performing configuration from our development
experiments to the test data are presented in
Table 2, together with a confusion matrix for
the classifier assignments. Party-wise F1 and
accuracy scores in addition to overall accuracy
and macro-averaged precision, recall and F1
are shown in the bottom four rows; compare
values in bold text to majority-class baseline
results of Acc=0.407, Prec=0.069, Rec=0.166 and
F1=0.097. There are two groups with compara-
tively poor prediction scores, the Liberal (ELDR)
and the Right (UEN). In the case of the former,
there are two key factors that may account for
this: (1) Ideological compositions of the group
and, (2) coalition-formation in the EP. Firstly,
ELDR consists of delegations from national
parties that tend to locate themselves between
the Social-Democratic (PES) and the Christian-
Democratic / Conservative parties (EPP-ED) at
the national arena. Due to differences in the
ideological landscape across EU member states,
some members of the ELDR may find themselves
holding views that are closer to those held by
PES or EPP-ED than ELDR representatives from
some countries. Secondly, in the period under
investigation, ELDR tended to form coalitions
with the EPP-ED on some policy areas and with
the PES on others. As MEPs mainly speak on
policies related to the Committees they serve
on, misclassifications as PES or EPP-ED may
be a reflection of the coaltion-formation on the
committees they served on (Hix and Høyland,
2013). When it comes to UEN, misclassification
as EPP-ED may be explained in terms of shared
ideology. In some cases, the membership of UEN
rather than EPP-ED is due to historical events
rather than ideological considerations (McElroy
and Benoit, 2012).

4 Research questions
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999650111111111">
This section briefly outlines some of the questions
we will be focusing on in the ongoing work of an-
alyzing the predictions of the SVM classifier in
more detail. In most cases this analysis will con-
sist of comparing prediction performance across
various relevant subsets of MEPs while looking
for systematic differences.
Contribution of linguistic features Much of
the work done to date in “text-as-data” approaches
in social sciences has been based on relatively sim-
ple and surface oriented features, typically bag-
of-words models, perhaps combined with term
weighting and stemming for word normalization
(for an overview of what is currently considered
best practice, see Grimmer and Stewart (2013)).
Much of the methodology can be seen as imports
from the fields of information retrieval and data
mining rather than natural language processing.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995678">

<bodyText confidence="0.99632259770115">
A relevant question for the current work is the
extent to which more linguistically informed fea-
tures can contribute to the task of predicting po-
litical affiliation, compared to “surface features”
based solely on directly observable lexical infor-
mation. One of our goals is to asses whether more
accurate models can be built by including richer
feature sets with more linguistically informed fea-
tures, like part-of-speech (PoS) tags, dependency
relations, class-based features drawn from unsu-
pervised word clustering, negation scope analysis,
and more. The preliminary results already demon-
strates that linguistically motivated features can
be useful for the current task, but there are still
many more feature types and combinations to be
explored.
Differences between new and old member
states Ten countries joined the European Union
in 2004. This offered a rare opportunity for the ex-
isting party groups to substantively increase their
share of the seats in the European Parliament by
recruiting national party delegations from the new
member states. As most of the new member states
have a relative short history of competitive mul-
tiparty system, there were weaker ties between
parties in new and old member states when com-
pared to previous rounds of enlargement. Since
the allocation of office spoils in the EP is fairly
proportional among party groups it was assumed
that national parties from the new member states
– less ideologically committed to any of the be-
lief systems held by the traditional Western Euro-
pean party families – would shift the allocation of
some offices in the EP by opting to join certain
party group who controlled a larger share of min-
isterial portfolios. If there are large differences
in classifier performance between members from
new and old members states, this can provide sup-
port for the hypothesis that national party delega-
tions from new member states joined the existing
party groups for other reasons than simply shared
ideological beliefs and goals. Høyland and God-
bout (2008) presented similar preliminary results
that already hint at this tendency. The ongoing
collaboration will further explore this question by
targeting it in new ways.
Differences between incumbents and freshmen
MEPs This point is tightly connected to the pre-
vious. Given that our training and testing data are
correspond to distinct consecutive terms of parlia-
ment, one should determine whether any differ-
ences in prediction performance for MEPs from
new and old member states can be explained sim-
ply by the fact that the latter will include many
MEPs that appear both in the training and the test
data (i.e., speakers participating in the debates in
both the 51h and 61h term). In order to factor out
any such “incumbency effect”, we will also in-
vestigate whether any differences can be found in
prediction performance between incumbents and
“freshmen” (members who joined the EP after
the 2004 elections) originating from old member
states only.
Differences between political domains An-
other effect we would like to measure is whether
there are any systematic differences in prediction
performance across different political topics or do-
mains. Among other things this could indicate that
the language use is more politicized or ideologi-
cally charged in debates concerning certain politi-
cal issues. Much of the work in the European Par-
liament is carried out in specialized committees
that prepare reports that will later be debated and
voted on in the plenary. By coupling the debates
with information about which legislative standing
committee has handled each particular case, we
would be able to automatically break down our
results according to political domain. This could
be achieved using a resource like that described
by Høyland et al. (2009). Examples of commit-
tee domains include Foreign Affairs, International
Trade, Legal Affairs, Regional Development, Eco-
nomic and Monetary Affairs, and Internal Market
and Consumer Protection, to name a few. Another
possibility here would be to train separate special-
ized classifiers for debates falling within the do-
main of each specialized committee directly.

This paper has outlined an interdisciplinary effort
to explore whether the recorded speeches from the
plenary debates of the European Parliament can be
utilized by an SVM classifier to correctly predict
the party affiliations of the participants. Prelim-

that such predictions can indeed be made – also
demonstrating the contribution of linguistically in-

number of related research questions currently be-

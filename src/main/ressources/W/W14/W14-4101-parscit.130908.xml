Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999813083333334">
Data archeology is a theoretically-
informed approach to make sense of the
digital artifacts left behind by a prior
learning “civilization.” Critical elements
include use of theoretical learning models
to construct analytic metrics, attention to
temporality as a means to reconstruct in-
dividual and collective trajectories, and
consideration of the pedagogical and
technological structures framing activity.
Examples of the approach using discus-
sion forum trace data will be presented.

Data traces that learners leave in online systems
offer the possibility to study learning activity,
predict outcomes, and designed targeted inter-
ventions for support (Siemens &amp; Long, 2011).
However, such analysis often focus on rudimen-
tary learning processes (series of related actions
engaged in as part of learning activities) without
attention to the larger learning practices they
make up (repertoires of processes organized
around particular foci that have meaning recog-
nized within a particular context and social
group) [Arastoopour et al., 2014]. This is an im-
portant concern for all learning analytics, but
particularly problematic when the desired target
of analytic claims is social interactions.
Lockyer, Heathcote &amp; Dawson (2013) concep-
tualize this issue through the relationship be-
tween learning analytics and learning design.
That is, creation and interpretation of valid ana-
lytic measures needs to be grounded in the “the
pedagogical and technical context in which the
data [was] generated” (p. 1440). The practical
implications of such are that the same analytic
measures and patterns in these measures may be
more or less useful, valid, and valued depending
on the pedagogical goals of the activity at a par-
ticular point in time. For example, a discussion
forum may be used in an online course course as
a place for Q &amp;A with experts (or relatively ex-
pert-peers) or for common interest groups to
work through different ways the course material
might apply to a particular situation or challenge.
A social network analysis of discussion replies
that produces a wheel-and-spoke structure may
be appropriate (and desired) for the former situa-
tion, but problematic in the latter (Brooks, Greer
&amp; Gutwin, 2014).
To address these issues I describe the notion
of data archeology (Wise, 2013) as theoretically-
informed efforts to make sense of the digital arti-
facts left behind by a prior “civilization.” Critical
aspects of taking a data archeology perspective
include: (a) the use of theoretical models of
learning to frame the construction and interpreta-
tion of analytic metrics; (b) attention to tempo-
rality (of data and analytic methods) as a means
to reconstruct individual and collective trajecto-
ries of engagement and interaction; and (c) con-
sideration of the pedagogical and technological
structures framing the activity that occurred.
Such an approach supports the development of
rich indicators that instructors and learners can
recognize as meaningful reflections of their par-
ticular practices of teaching and learning.
Examples of a data archeology approach to
discussion forum traces will be presented
grounding in the work of the E-Listening project
(Wise et al., 2012; 2013; 2014a; 2014b), a re-
search effort connecting the comments learners
make in online discussions with actions in at-
tending to the posts of others (invisible to other
learners, but visible in the clickstream record).

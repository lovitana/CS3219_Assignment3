Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999986529411765">
We present work on tuning the Heideltime
system for identifying time expressions in
clinical texts in English and French lan-
guages. The main amount of the method
is related to the enrichment and adap-
tation of linguistic resources to identify
Timex3 clinical expressions and to nor-
malize them. The test of the adapted ver-
sions have been done on the i2b2/VA 2012
corpus for English and a collection of clin-
ical texts for French, which have been an-
notated for the purpose of this study. We
achieve a 0.8500 F-measure on the recog-
nition and normalization of temporal ex-
pressions in English, and up to 0.9431 in
French. Future work will allow to improve
and consolidate the results.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998697">
Working with unstructured narrative texts is very
demanding on automatic methods to access, for-
malize and organize the information contained in
these documents. The first step is the indexing of
the documents in order to detect basic facts which
will allow more sophisticated treatments (e.g., in-
formation extraction, question/answering, visual-
ization, or textual entailment). We are mostly in-
terested in indexing of documents from the med-
ical field. We distinguish two kinds of indexing:
conceptual and contextual.
Conceptual indexing consists in finding out the
mentions of notions, terms or concepts contained
in documents. It is traditionally done thanks to
the exploitation of terminological resources, such
as MeSH (NLM, 2001), SNOMED International
(Cˆot´e et al., 1993), SNOMED CT (Wang et al.,
2002), etc. The process is dedicated to the recog-
nition of these terms and of their variants in doc-
uments (Nadkarni et al., 2001; Mercer and Di

Marco, 2004; Bashyam and Taira, 2006; Schulz
and Hahn, 2000; Davis et al., 2006).
The purpose of contextual indexing is to go fur-
ther and to provide a more fine-grained annota-
tion of documents. For this, additional informa-
tion may be searched in documents, such as polar-
ity, certainty, aspect or temporality related to the
concepts. If conceptual indexing extracts and pro-
vides factual information, contextual indexing is
aimed to describe these facts with more details.
For instance, when processing clinical records, the
medical facts related to a given patient can be aug-
mented with the associated contextual informa-
tion, such as in these examples:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9974525">
(1) Patient has the stomach aches.
(2) Patient denies the stomach aches.
(3) After taking this medication, patient
started to have the stomach aches.
(4) Two weeks ago, patient experienced the
stomach aches.
(5) In January 2014, patient experienced the
stomach aches.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.986987466666667">
In example (1), the information is purely fac-
tual, while it is negated in example (2). Example
(3) conveys also aspectual information (the med-
ical problem has started). In examples (4) and
(5), medical events are positioned in the time: rel-
ative (two weeks ago) and absolute (in January
2014). We can see that the medical history of pa-
tient can become more precise and detailed thanks
to such contextual information. In this way, fac-
tual information related to the stomach aches of
patient may receive these additional descriptions
which make each occurrence different and non-
redundant. Notice that the previous I2B2 contests1
addressed the information extraction tasks related
to different kinds of contextual information.

Temporality has become an important research
field in the NLP topics and several challenges ad-
dressed this taks: ACE (ACE challenge, 2004),
SemEval (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al.,
2010; UzZaman et al., 2013), I2B2 2012 (Sun
et al., 2013). We propose to continue working
on the extraction of temporal information related
to medical events. This kind of study relies on
several important tasks when processing the nar-
rative documents : identification and normaliza-
tion of linguistic expressions that are indicative of
the temporality (Verhagen et al., 2007; Chang and
Manning, 2012; Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2012; Kessler
et al., 2012), and their modelization and chain-
ing (Batal et al., 2009; Moskovitch and Shahar,
2009; Pustejovsky et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2013;
Grouin et al., 2013). The identification of tempo-
ral expressions provides basic knowledge for other
tasks processing the temporality information. The
existing available automatic systems such as Hei-
delTime (Str¨otgen and Gertz, 2012) or SUTIME
(Chang and Manning, 2012) exploit rule-based
approaches, which makes them adaptable to new
data and areas. During a preliminary study, we
tested several such systems for identification of
temporal relations and found that HeidelTime has
the best combination of performance and adapt-
ability. We propose to exploit this automatic sys-
tems, to adapt and to test it on the medical clinical
documents in two languages (English and French).
In the following of this study, we introduce
the corpora (Section 2) and methods (Section 3).
We then describe and discuss the obtained results
(Section 4.2) and conclude (Section 5).

2 Material
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999920823529412">
Corpora composed of training and test sets are the
main material we work with. The corpora are in
two languages, English and French, and has com-
parable sizes. All the processed corpora are de-
identified. Corpora in English are built within the
I2B2 2012 challenge (Sun et al., 2013). The train-
ing corpus consists of 190 clinical records and the
test corpus of 120 records. The reference data con-
tain annotations of temporal expressions accord-
ing to the Timex3s guidelines: date, duration, fre-
quency and time (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). Cor-
pora in French are built on purpose of this study.
The clinical documents are issued from a French
hospital. The training corpus consists of 182 clin-
ical records and the test corpus of 120 records. 25
documents from the test set are annotated to pro-
vide the reference data for evaluation.

3 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999981806451613">
HeidelTime is a cross-domain temporal tagger that
extracts temporal expressions from documents and
normalizes them according to the Timex3 anno-
tation standard, which is part of the markup lan-
guage TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). This
is a rule-based system. Because the source code
and the resources (patterns, normalization infor-
mation, and rules) are strictly separated, it is pos-
sible to develop and implement resources for ad-
ditional languages and areas using HeidelTime’s
rule syntax. HeidelTime is provided with modules
for processing documents in several languages,
e.g. French (Moriceau and Tannier, 2014). In En-
glish, several versions of the system exist, such as
general-language English and scientific English.
HeidelTime uses different normalization strate-
gies depending on the domain of the documents
that are to be processed: news, narratives (e.g.
Wikipedia articles), colloquial (e.g. SMS, tweets),
and scientific (e.g. biomedical studies). The news
strategy allows to fix the document creation date.
This date is important for computing and normal-
izing the relative dates, such as two weeks ago
or 5 days later, for which the reference point in
time is necessary: if the document creation date is
2012/03/24, two weeks ago becomes 2012/03/10.
Our method consists of three steps: tuning Hei-
delTime to clinical data in English and French
(Section 3.1), evaluation of the results (Section
3.2), and exploitation of the computed data for the
visualization of the medical events (Section 3.3).

3.1 Tuning HeidelTime
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998487769230769">
While HeidelTime proposes a good coverage of
the temporal expressions used in general language
documents, it needs to be adapted to specialized
areas. We propose to tune this tool to the medi-
cal domain documents. The tuning is done in two
languages (English and French). Tuning involves
three aspects:
1. The most important adaptation needed is re-
lated to the enrichment and encoding of lin-
guistic expressions specific to medical and
especially clinical temporal expressions, such
as post-operative day #, b.i.d. meaning twice
a day, day of life, etc.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.995085">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.968190461538462">
2. The admission date is considered as the refer-
ence or starting point for computing relative
dates, such as 2 days later. For the identi-
fication of the admission date, specific pre-
processing step is applied in order to detect it
within the documents;
3. Additional normalizations of the temporal
expressions are done for normalizing the
durations in approximate numerical values
rather than in the undefined ’X’-value; and
for external computation for some durations
and frequencies due to limitations in Heidel-
Time’s internal arithmetic processor.

In order to judge about the usefulness of the tem-
poral information extracted, we exploit it to build
the timeline. For this, the medical events are asso-
ciated with normalized and absolute temporal in-
formation. This temporal information is then used
to order and visualize the medical events.

<bodyText confidence="0.999969875">
The experiments performed are the following.
Data in English and French are processed. Data in
two languages are processed by available versions
of HeidelTime: two existing versions (general lan-
guage and scientific language) and the medical
version created thanks to the work performed in
this study. Results obtained are evaluated against
the reference data.

4.2 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997076923077">
We added several new rules to HeidelTime (164
in English and 47 in French) to adapt the recog-
nition of temporal expressions in medical docu-
ments. Some cases are difficult to annotate. For
instance, it is complicated to decide whether some
expressions are concerned with dates or durations.
The utterance like 2 years ago (il y a 2 ans) is
considered to indicate the date. The utterance like
since 2010 (depuis 2010) is considered to indicate
the duration, although it can be remarked that the
beginning of the duration interval marks the begin-
ning of the process and its date. Another complex
situation appears with the relative dates:

<listItem confidence="0.982468">
• as already mentioned, date like 2 years ago

pressions like the day of the surgery (le jour
de l’op´eration) or at the end of the treatment
by antiobiotics (`a la fin de l’antibiothrapie),
for which it is necessary first to make the ref-
erence in time of the other medical event be-
fore being able to define the date in question.
In Table 1, we present the evaluation results for
English. On the training corpus, with the general
language version and the scientific version of Hei-
delTime, we obtain F-measure around 0.66: preci-
sion (0.77 to 0.79) is higher than recall (0.56). The
values of F-measure and APR are identical. The
version we adapted to the medical language pro-
vides better results for all the evaluation measures
used: F-measure becomes then 0.84, with preci-
sion up to 0.85 and recall 0.84. This is a good im-
provement of the automatic tool which indicates
that specialized areas, such as medical area, use
indeed specific lexicon and constructions. Inter-
estingly, on the test corpus, the results decrease
for the general language and scientific versions
of HeidelTime, but increase for the medical ver-
sion of HeidelTime, with F-measure 0.85. During
the I2B2 competition, the maximal F-measure ob-
tained was 0.91. With F-measure 0.84, our system
was ranked 10/14 on the English data. Currently,
we improve these previous results.
In Table 2, we present the results obtained on
the French test corpus (26 documents). Two ver-
sions of HeidelTime are applied: general lan-
guage, that is already available, and medical, that
has been developed in the presented work. We can

observe that the adapted version suits better the
content of clinical documents and improves the F-
measure values by 3 points, reaching up to 0.94.
The main limitation of the system is due to
the incomplete coverage of the linguistic expres-
sions (e.g. au cours de, mensuel (during, monthly)).
Among the current false positives, we can find ra-
tios (2/10 is considered as date, while it means lab
results), polysemous expressions (Juillet in rue du
14 Juillet (14 Juillet street)), and segmentation errors
(few days detected instead of the next few days).
These limitations will be fixed in the future work.
In Figure 1, we propose a visualization of the
temporal data, which makes use of the temporal
information extracted. In this way, the medical
events can be ordered thanks to their temporal an-
chors, which becomes a very useful information
presentation in clinical practice (Hsu et al., 2012).
The visualization of unspecified expressions (e.g.
later, sooner) is being studied. Although it seems
that such expressions often occur with more spe-
cific expressions (e.g. later that day).

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987823529412">
HeidelTime, an existing tool for extracting
and normalizing temporal information, has been
adapted to the medical area documents in two
languages (English and French). It is evaluated
against the reference data, which indicates that
its tuning to medical documents is efficient: we
reach F-measure 0.85 in English and up to 0.94
in French. More complete data in French are be-
ing annotated, which will allow to perform a more
complete evaluation of the tuned version. We plan
to make the tuned version of HeidelTime freely
available. Automatically extracted temporal infor-
mation can be exploited for the visualization of the
clinical data related to patients. Besides, these data
can be combined with other kinds of contextual in-
formation (polarity, uncertainty) to provide a more
exhaustive picture of medical history of patients.

Among the current false positives, we can find ratios (2/10 is considered as date, while it means lab results), polysemous expressions (Juillet in rue du 14 Juillet (14 Juillet street)), and segmentation errors (few days detected instead of the next few days). These limitations will be fixed in the future work. In Figure 1, we propose a visualization of the temporal data, which makes use of the temporal information extracted. In this way, the medical events can be ordered thanks to their temporal anchors, which becomes a very useful information presentation in clinical practice (Hsu et al., 2012). The visualization of unspecified expressions (e.g. later, sooner) is being studied. Although it seems that such expressions often occur with more specific expressions (e.g. later that day). 5 Conclusion HeidelTime, an existing tool for extracting and normalizing temporal information, has been adapted to the medical area documents in two languages (English and French). It is evaluated against the reference data, which indicates that its tuning to medical documents is efficient: we reach F-measure 0.85 in English and up to 0.94 in French.

This is a rule-based system. Because the source code and the resources (patterns, normalization information, and rules) are strictly separated, it is possible to develop and implement resources for additional languages and areas using HeidelTime’s rule syntax. HeidelTime is provided with modules for processing documents in several languages, e.g. French (Moriceau and Tannier, 2014). In English, several versions of the system exist, such as general-language English and scientific English. HeidelTime uses different normalization strategies depending on the domain of the documents that are to be processed: news, narratives (e.g. Wikipedia articles), colloquial (e.g. SMS, tweets), and scientific (e.g. biomedical studies). The news strategy allows to fix the document creation date. This date is important for computing and normalizing the relative dates, such as two weeks ago or 5 days later, for which the reference point in time is necessary: if the document creation date is</context>

In the following of this study, we introduce the corpora (Section 2) and methods (Section 3). We then describe and discuss the obtained results (Section 4.2) and conclude (Section 5). 2 Material Corpora composed of training and test sets are the main material we work with. The corpora are in two languages, English and French, and has comparable sizes. All the processed corpora are deidentified. Corpora in English are built within the I2B2 2012 challenge (Sun et al., 2013). The training corpus consists of 190 clinical records and the test corpus of 120 records. The reference data contain annotations of temporal expressions according to the Timex3s guidelines: date, duration, frequency and time (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). Corpora in French are built on purpose of this study. The clinical documents are issued from a French hospital. The training corpus consists of 182 clinical records and the test corpus of 120 records. 25 documents from the test set are annotated to provide the reference data for evaluation. 3 Method HeidelTime is a cross-domain temporal tagger </context>

We are mostly interested in indexing of documents from the medical field. We distinguish two kinds of indexing: conceptual and contextual. Conceptual indexing consists in finding out the mentions of notions, terms or concepts contained in documents. It is traditionally done thanks to the exploitation of terminological resources, such as MeSH (NLM, 2001), SNOMED International (Cˆot´e et al., 1993), SNOMED CT (Wang et al., 2002), etc. The process is dedicated to the recognition of these terms and of their variants in documents (Nadkarni et al., 2001; Mercer and Di Natalia Grabar CNRS UMR 8163 STL Universit´e Lille 3 59653 Villeneuve d’Ascq, France natalia.grabar@univ-lille3.fr Marco, 2004; Bashyam and Taira, 2006; Schulz and Hahn, 2000; Davis et al., 2006). The purpose of contextual indexing is to go further and to provide a more fine-grained annotation of documents. For this, additional information may be searched in documents, such as polarity, certainty, aspect or temporality related to the concepts. If conceptual</context>

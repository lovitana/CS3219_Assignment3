We present an efficient method to auto-
matically transform spoken language text
to standard written language text for var-
ious dialects of Tamil. Our work is novel
in that it explicitly addresses the problem
and need for processing dialectal and
spoken language Tamil. Written language
equivalents for dialectal and spoken lan-
guage forms are obtained using Finite
State Transducers (FSTs) where spoken
language suffixes are replaced with ap-
propriate written language suffixes. Ag-
glutination and compounding in the re-
sultant text is handled using Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) based word
boundary identifier. The essential Sandhi
corrections are carried out using a heuris-
tic Sandhi Corrector which normalizes
the segmented words to simpler sensible
words. During experimental evaluations
dialectal spoken to written transformer
(DSWT) achieved an encouraging accu-
racy of over 85% in transformation task
and also improved the translation quality
of Tamil-English machine translation
system by 40%. It must be noted that
there is no published computational work
on processing Tamil dialects. Ours is the
first attempt to study various dialects of
Tamil in a computational point of view.
Thus, the nature of the work reported
here is pioneering.

With the advent of Web 2.0 applications, the fo-
cus of communication through the Internet has
shifted from publisher oriented activities to user
oriented activities such as blogging, social media
chats, and discussions in online forums. Given
the unmediated nature of these services, users
conveniently share the contents in their native
languages in a more natural and informal way.
This has resulted in bringing together the con-
tents of various languages. More often these con-
tents are informal, colloquial, and dialectal in
nature. The dialect is defined as a variety of a
language that is distinguished from other varie-
ties of the same language by features of phonol-
ogy, grammar, and vocabulary and by its use by
a group of speakers who are set off from others
geographically or socially. The dialectal varia-
tion refers to changes in a language due to vari-
ous influences such as geographic, social, educa-
tional, individual and group factors. The dialects
vary primarily based on geographical locations.
They also vary based on social class, caste,
community, gender, etc. which differ phonologi-
cally, morphologically, and syntactically (Ha-
bash and Rambow, 2006). Here we study spoken
and dialectal Tamil language and aim to auto-
matically transform them to standard written lan-
guage.
Tamil language has more than 70 million
speakers worldwide and is spoken mainly in
southern India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Ma-
laysia. It has 15 known dialects1 which vary
mainly based on geographic location and reli-
gious community of the people. The dialects
used in southern Tamil Nadu are different from
the dialects prevalent in western and other parts
of Tamil Nadu. Sri Lankan Tamil is relatively
conservative and still retains the older features of
Tamil2. So its dialect differs considerably from
the dialects spoken elsewhere. Tamil dialect is
also dependent on religious community. The var-

iation of dialects based on caste is studied and
described by A.K. Ramanujan (1968) where he
observed that Tamil Brahmins speak a very dis-
tinct form of Tamil known as Brahmin Tamil
(BT) which varies greatly from the dialects used
in other religious communities. While perform-
ing a preliminary corpus study on Tamil dialects,
we found that textual contents in personal blogs,
social media sites, chat forums, and comments,
comprise mostly dialectal and spoken language
words similar to what one can hear and use in
day-to-day communication. This practice is
common because the authors intend to establish a
comfortable communication and enhance intima-
cy with their audiences. This activity produces
informal, colloquial and dialectal textual data.
These dialectal and spoken language usages will
not conform to the standard spellings of Literary
Tamil (LT). This causes problems in many text
based Natural Language Processing (NLP) sys-
tems as they generally work on the assumption
that the input is in standard written language. To
overcome this problem, these dialectal and spo-
ken language forms need to be converted to
Standard Written language Text (SWT) before
doing any computational work with them.
Computational processing of dialectal and
spoken language Tamil is challenging since the
language has motley of dialects and the usage in
one dialect varies from other dialects from very
minimal to greater extents. It is also very likely
that multiple spoken-forms of a given word with-
in a dialect which we call as „variants‟ may cor-
respond to single canonical written-form word
and a spoken-form word may map to more than
one canonical written-form. These situations ex-
ist in all Tamil dialects. In addition, it is very
likely to encounter conflicts with the spoken and
written-forms of one dialect with other dialects
and vice versa. Most importantly, the dialects are
used mainly in spoken communication and when
they are written by users, they do not conform to
standard spoken-form spellings and sometimes
inconsistent spellings are used even for a single
written-form of a word. In other words Schiff-
man (1988) noted that every usage of a given
spoken-form can be considered as Standard Spo-
ken Tamil (SST) unless it has wrong spellings to
become nonsensical.
Few researchers have attempted to transform
the dialects and spoken-forms of languages to
standard written languages. Habash and Rambow
(2006) developed MAGEAD, a morphological
analyzer and generator for Arabic dialects where
the authors made use of root+pattern+features
representation for the transformation of Arabic
dialects to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and
performed morphological analysis. In the case of
Tamil language, Umamaheswari et al. (2011)
proposed a technique based on pattern mapping
and spelling variation rules for transforming col-
loquial words to written-language words. The
reported work considered only a handful of rules
for the most common spoken forms. So this ap-
proach will fail when dialectal variants of words
are encountered because it is more likely that the
spelling variation rules of the spoken language
vary from the rules of dialectal usages. This limi-
tation hinders the possibility of the system to
generalize. Alternatively, performing a simple
list based mapping between spoken and written
form words is also inefficient and unattainable.
Spoken language words exhibit fairly regular
pattern of suffixations and inflections within a
given paradigm (Schiffman, 1999). So we pro-
pose a novel method based on Finite State
Transducers for effectively transforming dialec-
tal and spoken Tamil to standard written Tamil.
We make use of the regularity of suffixations and
model them as FSTs. These FSTs are used to
perform transformation which produces words in
standard literary Tamil.
Our experimental results show that DSWT
achieves high precision and recall values. In ad-
dition, it improves the translation quality of ma-
chine translation systems when unknown words
occur mainly due to colloquialism. This im-
provement gradually increases as the unknown
word rate increases due to colloquial and dialec-
tal nature of words.
Broadly, DSWT can be used in a variety of
NLP applications such as Morphological Analy-
sis, Rule-based and Statistical Machine Transla-
tion (SMT), Information Retrieval (IR), Named-
Entity Recognition (NER), and Text-To-Speech
(TTS). In general, it can be used in any NLP sys-
tem where there is a need to retrieve written lan-
guage words from dialectal and spoken language
Tamil words.
The paper is further organized as follows: In
section 2, the challenges in processing Tamil di-
alects are explained. Section 3 explains the cor-
pus collection and study. Section 4 explains the
peculiarities seen in spoken and dialectal Tamil.

DSWT. Section 6 describes conducted Experi-
mental evaluations and the results. Section 7 dis-
cusses about the results and the paper concludes

2 Challenges in Processing Tamil Di-
alects
Tamil, a member of Dravidian language family,
is highly inflectional and agglutinative in nature.
The phenomenon of agglutination becomes much
pronounced in dialects and spoken-form com-
munication where much of the phonemes of suf-
fixes get truncated and form agglutinated words
which usually have two or more simpler words in
them. A comprehensive study on the Grammar
of Spoken Tamil for various syntactic categories
is presented in Schiffman (1979) and Schiffman
(1999). Various dialects are generally used in
spoken discourse and while writing them people
use inconsistent spellings for a given spoken lan-
guage word. The spelling usages primarily de-
pend on educational qualification of the authors.
Sometimes, the authors intentionally use certain
types of spelling to express satire and humor.
Due to this spelling and dialectal variation
many-to-one mapping happens where all the va-
riants correspond to single canonical written
form. This is illustrated with the dialectal and
spelling variants of the verb “paarkkiReen” (see)
in Fig 1.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.972797">
Figure 1. many-to-one mapping
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999863857142857">
For the words that belong to the above case,
there is no hard rule that a particular pattern of
spelling will be used and referred to while the
text is written by people. In addition to this map-
ping, one-to-many mapping is also possible
where a single spoken form maps to multiple
canonical written forms.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.980102">
Figure 2. one-to-many mapping
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999996380952381">
In the case of one-to-many mapping, multiple
written language words will be obtained. Choos-
ing a correct written language word over other
words is dependent on the context where the di-
alectal spoken language word occurs. In some
cases, the sentence may be terminated by punc-
tuations such as question marks which can be
made use of to select an appropriate written lan-
guage word. To achieve correct selection of a
word, an extensive study has to be conducted and
is not the focus of this paper. In the current work
we are interested in obtaining as many possible
mappings as possible. Many-to-one mapping
occurs mainly due to dialectal and spelling varia-
tions of spoken-forms whereas one-to-many
mapping happens because a single spoken-form
may convey different meanings in different con-
texts. Dialectal spoken forms of many-to-one and
one-to-many mappings are more prevalent than
one-to-one mapping where a dialectal spoken
form maps to exactly one written form word.

3 Data Collection and Corpus Study
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999722689655172">
The dialectal spoken form of a language is pri-
marily used for colloquial and informal commu-
nication among native speakers. They are also
commonly seen in personal blogs, social media
chats and comments, discussion forums etc. Giv-
en this informal nature of the language usage,
such a variety is not used in formal print and
broadcasting media as they mainly use standard
literary Tamil.
In our preliminary study, we found that textual
contents in personal blogs, tweets, and chats
have significantly large number of dialectal and
spoken language words than those are found in
other standard online resources such as news
publishers, entertainment media websites etc.
Since we focus on processing various Tamil
dialects and their spoken language variants, we
have collected publicly available data from the
above mentioned online resources for this work.
The collected data belongs to authors from
various geographic locations where different
Tamil dialects exist. The textual contents in the
selected resources mainly contain movie reviews,
narratives, travel experiences, fables, poems, and
sometimes an informal discourse, all in a casual
and colloquial manner. Further, we were able to
collect variants of spoken forms which vary with
respect to person, social status, location, com-
munity, gender, age, qualification etc.

4 Tamil Dialects and their Peculiarities

<bodyText confidence="0.999780695652174">
Some dialectal words have totally different
meaning in SST and in other dialects or in stan-
dard literary Tamil. For instance, consider the
following dialectal sentence (Tirunelveli Tamil)
ela, inga vaala.
Hey here come
„Hey come here!‟
The words “ela” and “vaala” convey different
meanings in different contexts and dialects. In
SST they denote “leaf” and “tail” respectively
while in Tirunelveli Tamil dialect they convey
the meaning “hey” and “come” respectively.
Though these ambiguities are resolved when
the context is considered, they make the trans-
formation task challenging since this is a word-
level task and no context information is taken
into account during transformation.
The example in table 2, illustrates spelling
based variants where the variants map to single
canonical written form. We observed that the
most common form of spoken-language usage is
the use and representation of “enRu” (ADV) as
four variants which are shown in Table 2.

In this section we describe our system architec-

spoken to written transformer (DSWT) has three
main components namely, Transformation En-

Transformation Engine contains FSTs
for the dialectal and spoken language
to standard written language transfor-
mation. The resultant words may be
agglutinated and is decomposed with
the help of CRF boundary identifier.
CRF Word Boundary Identifier mod-
ule identifies the word boundaries in
agglutinated words and splits them in-
to a set of constituent simpler words.
Heuristic Sandhi Corrector module
makes necessary spelling changes to
the segmented constituent words and
standardizes them to canonical and
meaningful simpler words.

Since Tamil is a morphologically rich language,

and very common. It is also present in dialectal

of challenges to the development of NLP sys-
tems. To solve these challenges, we segment the
agglutinated and compound words into simpler
constituent words. This decomposition is

CRF Word-Boundary Identifier
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999868184210526">
CRF based word-boundary identifier marks the
boundaries of simpler constituent words in ag-
glutinated and compound words and segments
them. CRFs are a discriminative probabilistic
framework for labeling and segmenting sequen-
tial data. They are undirected graphical models
trained to maximize a conditional probability
(Lafferty et al., 2001).
Generally word-boundary identification is stu-
died extensively for languages such as Chinese
and Japanese but the necessity for Indian lan-
guages was not considered until recently. Al-
though there is no standard definition of word-
boundary in Chinese, Peng et al. (2004) describe
a robust approach for Chinese word segmenta-
tion using linear-chain CRFs where the flexibili-
ty of CRFs to support arbitrary overlapping fea-
tures with long-range dependencies and multiple
levels of granularity are utilized by integrating
the rich domain knowledge in the form of mul-
tiple lexicons of characters and words into the
framework for accurate word segmentation.
In case of Japanese, though the word bounda-
ries are not clear, Kudo et al. (2004) used CRFs
for Japanese morphological analysis where they
show how CRFs can be applied to situations
where word-boundary ambiguity exists.
Marimuthu et al. (2013) worked on word
boundary identification and segmentation in Ta-
mil where they model the boundary identification
as a sequence labeling task [i.e. a tagging task].
The absence of word-boundary ambiguity in
Tamil language favors the boundary identifica-
tion task and predominantly eliminates the need
for providing further knowledge to CRFs such as
multiple lexicons as in the case of Chinese word
segmentation. Hence we have used word level
features alone for training the CRFs.

Sandhi Correction using Word-level Contex-
tual Rules
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994688896551724">
Word-level contextual rules are the spelling
rules in which each constituent word of an agglu-
tinated or compound word is dependent either on
the previous or the next or both constituent
words to give a correct meaning.
After boundary identification, suppose an ag-
glutinated or a compound word is split into three
constituent words, Sandhi correction for the first
constituent word is dependent only on the second
constituent word while the second word&apos;s Sandhi
correction depends on both first and third consti-
tuent word whereas the third constituent word&apos;s
Sandhi correction depends on second constituent
word alone.
Sandhi correction is performed using these
rules to make necessary spelling changes to the
boundary-segmented words in order to normalize
them to sensible simpler words. It is accom-
plished using three tasks namely insertion, dele-
tion, and substitution as described in Marimuthu
et al. (2013).
For instance, after boundary identification the
word “nampuvathillaiyenRu” (will not be believ-
ing) will be boundary marked and Sandhi cor-
rected as shown in the Table 4 above.
Advantages of Word boundary Identification
Morphological Analysis of simpler words is
much easier than analyzing agglutinated and

So the word-boundary identifier eases the task of
morphological analyzer in identifying the indi-
vidual morphemes. In addition, it nullifies the
unknown words category if it occurs due to ag-
glutination and compounding. As a result, it im-
proves the recall of the morphological analyzer
and any advanced NLP system. For example,
with Tamil, SMT models usually perform better
when the compound words are broken into their
components. This &apos;segmentation&apos; gives the word
alignment greater resolution when matching the
groupings between the two languages.

<bodyText confidence="0.9997665">
For indirect evaluation, we had used DSWT with
Google Translate (GT) to measure the influence
of DSWT in Tamil-English machine translation,
and evaluated the improvement.
Our test data had 100 Tamil sentences which
are of dialectal and colloquial in nature. At first,
we used GT to translate these sentences to Eng-
lish. This is Output1. Then we used our DSWT
to transform the dialectal sentences into standard
written Tamil. After this, the standard sentences
were translated to English using GT. This cor-
responds to Output2.
We then performed subjective evaluations of
Output1 and Output2 with the help of three na-
tive Tamil speakers whose second language is
English. The three evaluation scores for each
sentence in Output1 and Output2 are averaged.
The obtained scores are shown in Table 6.

It can be observed from the results in Table 6
that GT failed to translate dialectal and spoken
language sentences. But the failure got mitigated
after transformation causing dramatic improve-
ment in translation quality. The following Table
illustrates few examples where the translation
quality has improved after transforming dialectal
spoken language.
It must be noted from Table 7 that after the
transformation of dialectal spoken language, all
the sentences were able to achieve their English
equivalents during machine translation. This
suggests that almost all word categories in Tamil
can achieve improved translations if the words
are given as standard simple written language
words. This experiment emphasizes the impor-
tance of feeding the machine translation systems
with standard written language text to achieve
quality translations and better results.

7 Results and Discussion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959684210526">
We observe that the achieved accuracy is higher
for Kongu Tamil dialect when compared to other
dialects. This is because words in this dialect are
rarely polysemous in nature. But the number of
polysemous words is high in the case of Madurai
and Tirunelveli Tamil dialect and this resulted in
low accuracy of transformation.
While performing transformation, the possible
causes for ending up with unknown words may
be due to the absence of suffix patterns in FSTs,
errors in input words, uncommonly transliterated
words, and English acronyms. The standard writ-
ten language words convey a particular meaning
in standard literary Tamil and completely differ-
ent meaning in dialectal usages. For instance,
consider the verb “vanthaaka”. In standard lite-
rary Tamil, this is used in the imperative sense
“should come” while in Tirunelveli Tamil dialect
it is used in the sense “somebody came”.

8 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999945857142857">
We have presented a dialectal and spoken lan-
guage to standard written language transformer
for Tamil language and evaluated its perfor-
mance directly using standard evaluation metrics
and indirectly using Google Translate for Tamil
to English machine translation. The achieved
results are encouraging.
There is no readily available corpus for
processing dialectal and spoken Tamil texts and
we have collected the dialectal and spoken lan-
guage corpus for developmental and evaluation
tasks. This corpus can be made use of for devel-
oping other NLP applications.
In case of one-to-many mapping, multiple
written language forms will be emitted as out-
puts. Hence, determining which written-form of
word to be adopted over other resultant written-
forms has to be done based on the meaning of the
whole sentence in which the spoken-language
word occurs. This will be the focus of our future
direction of the work.

<abstract confidence="0.998835878787879">We present an efficient method to automatically transform spoken language text to standard written language text for various dialects of Tamil. Our work is novel in that it explicitly addresses the problem and need for processing dialectal and spoken language Tamil. Written language equivalents for dialectal and spoken language forms are obtained using Finite State Transducers (FSTs) where spoken language suffixes are replaced with appropriate written language suffixes. Agglutination and compounding in the resultant text is handled using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) based word boundary identifier. The essential Sandhi corrections are carried out using a heuristic Sandhi Corrector which normalizes the segmented words to simpler sensible words. During experimental evaluations dialectal spoken to written transformer (DSWT) achieved an encouraging accuracy of over 85% in transformation task and also improved the translation quality of Tamil-English machine translation system by 40%. It must be noted that there is no published computational work on processing Tamil dialects. Ours is the first attempt to study various dialects of Tamil in a computational point of view. Thus, the nature of the work reported here is pioneering.</abstract>

Most importantly, the dialects are used mainly in spoken communication and when they are written by users, they do not conform to standard spoken-form spellings and sometimes inconsistent spellings are used even for a single written-form of a word.

So this approach will fail when dialectal variants of words are encountered because it is more likely that the spelling variation rules of the spoken language vary from the rules of dialectal usages. This limitation hinders the possibility of the system to generalize. Alternatively, performing a simple list based mapping between spoken and written form words is also inefficient and unattainable. Spoken language words exhibit fairly regular pattern of suffixations and inflections within a given paradigm (Schiffman, 1999). So we propose a novel method based on Finite State Transducers for effectively transforming dialectal and spoken Tamil to standard written Tamil. We make use of the regularity of suffixations and model them as FSTs. These FSTs are used to perform transformation which produces words in standard literary Tamil. Our experimental results show that DSWT achieves high precision and recall values. In addition, it improves the translation quality of machine translation systems when unknown words occur mainly due to colloquialism. This improvement gradually increases as the unknown word rate increase</context>

In case of Japanese, though the word boundaries are not clear, Kudo et al. (2004) used CRFs for Japanese morphological analysis where they show how CRFs can be applied to situations where word-boundary ambiguity exists. Marimuthu et al. (2013) worked on word boundary identification and segmentation in Tamil where they model the boundary identification as a sequence labeling task [i.e. a tagging task]. The absence of word-boundary ambiguity in Tamil language favors the boundary identification task and predominantly eliminates the need for providing further knowledge to CRFs such as multiple lexicons as in the case of Chinese word segmentation. Hence we have used word level features alone for training the CRFs.

It is accomplished using three tasks namely insertion, deletion, and substitution as described in Marimuthu et al. (2013).

The dialectal variation refers to changes in a language due to various influences such as geographic, social, educational, individual and group factors. The dialects vary primarily based on geographical locations. They also vary based on social class, caste, community, gender, etc. which differ phonologically, morphologically, and syntactically (Habash and Rambow, 2006). Here we study spoken and dialectal Tamil language and aim to automatically transform them to standard written language. Tamil language has more than 70 million speakers worldwide and is spoken mainly in southern India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Malaysia. It has 15 known dialects1 which vary mainly based on geographic location and religious community of the people. The dialects used in southern Tamil Nadu are different from the dialects prevalent in western and other parts of Tamil Nadu.

Although there is no standard definition of wordboundary in Chinese, Peng et al. (2004) describe a robust approach for Chinese word segmentation using linear-chain CRFs where the flexibility of CRFs to support arbitrary overlapping features with long-range dependencies and multiple levels of granularity are utilized by integrating the rich domain knowledge in the form of multiple lexicons of characters and words into the framework for accurate word segmentation. In case of Japanese, though the word boundaries are not clear, Kudo et al. (2004) used CRFs for Japanese morphological analysis where they show how CRFs can be applied to situations where word-boundary ambiguity exists. Marimuthu et al. (2013) worked on word boundary identification and segmentation in Tamil where they model the boundary identification as a sequence labeling task [i.e. a tagging task]. The absence of word-boundary ambiguity in Tamil language favors the boundary identification task and predominantly eliminates the need for providing further knowledge to CRFs such as multiple lexicons as in the case of Chinese word segmentation. Hence we have used word level </context>

Few researchers have attempted to transform the dialects and spoken-forms of languages to standard written languages. Habash and Rambow (2006) developed MAGEAD, a morphological analyzer and generator for Arabic dialects where the authors made use of root+pattern+features representation for the transformation of Arabic dialects to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and performed morphological analysis. In the case of Tamil language, Umamaheswari et al. (2011) proposed a technique based on pattern mapping and spelling variation rules for transforming colloquial words to written-language words. The reported work considered only a handful of rules for the most common spoken forms. So this approach will fail when dialectal variants of words are encountered because it is more likely that the spelling variation rules of the spoken language vary from the rules of dialectal usages. This limitation hinders the possibility of the system to generalize. Alternatively, performing a simple list based mapping between spoken and written form words is also ineffic</context>

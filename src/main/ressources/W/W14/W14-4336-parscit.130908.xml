1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999853590909091">
With the advent of evaluations “in the wild”,
emphasis is being put on converting re-
search prototypes into mobile applications that
can be used for evaluation and data col-
lection by real users downloading the ap-
plication from the market place. This is
the motivation behind the work demonstrated
here where we present a modular framework
whereby research components from the PAR-
LANCE project (Hastie et al., 2013) can be
plugged in, tested and evaluated in a mobile
environment.
The goal of PARLANCE is to perform inter-
active search through speech in multiple lan-
guages. The domain for the demonstration
system is interactive search for restaurants in
Cambridge, UK for Mandarin and San Fran-
cisco, USA for English. The scenario is that
Mandarin speaking tourists would be able to
download the application and use it to learn
about restaurants in English speaking towns
and cities.

<bodyText confidence="0.997684857142857">
Here, we adopt a client-server approach as il-
lustrated in Figure 1 for Mandarin and Figure
2 for English. The front end of the demon-
stration system is an Android application that
calls the Google Automatic Speech Recogni-
tion (ASR) API and sends the recognized user
utterance to a server running the Interaction

Text-To-Speech (TTS) API. After the system
utterance finishes the recognizer starts to lis-
ten for user input to send to the SLU compo-
nent. The SLU converts text into a semantic
interpretation consisting of a set of triples of
communicative function, attribute, and (op-
tionally) value1. Probabilities can be associ-
ated with candidate interpretations to reflect
uncertainty in either the ASR or SLU. The
SLU then passes the semantic interpretation
to the IM within the same server.
Chinese sentences are composed of strings of
characters without any space to mark words as
other languages do, for example:

<bodyText confidence="0.999339464285714">
In order to correctly parse and understand
Chinese sentences, Chinese word segmenta-
tions must be performed. To do this segmen-
tation, we use the Stanford Chinese word seg-
mentor2, which relies on a linear-chain condi-
tional random field (CRF) model and treats
word segmentation as a binary decision task.
The Java Socket Server then sends the seg-
mented Chinese sentence to the SLU on the
server.
The IM then selects a dialogue act, accesses
the database and in the case of English passes
back the list of restaurant identification num-
bers (ids) associated with the relevant restau-
rants. For the English demonstration system,
these restaurants are displayed on the smart
phone as seen in Figures 4 and 5. Finally,
the NLG component decides how best to re-
alise the restaurant descriptions and sends the
string back to the phone application for the
TTS to realise. The example output is illus-
trated in Figure 3 for Mandarin and Figure 4
for English.
As discussed above, the PARLANCE mobile
application can be used as a test-bed for com-
paring alternative techniques for various com-
ponents. Here we discuss two such compo-
nents: IM and NLG.

2.1 Interaction Management
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999763263157895">
The PARLANCE Interaction Manager is based
on the partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) framework, where the sys-
tem’s decisions can be optimised via reinforce-
ment learning. The model adopted for PAR-
LANCE is the Bayesian Update of Dialogue
State (BUDS) manager (Thomson and Young,
2010). This POMDP-based IM factors the di-
alogue state into conditionally dependent ele-
ments. Dependencies between these elements
can be derived directly from the dialogue on-
tology. These elements are arranged into a dy-
namic Bayesian network which allows for their
marginal probabilities to be updated during
the dialogue, comprising the belief state. The
belief state is then mapped into a smaller-scale
summary space and the decisions are optimised
using the natural actor critic algorithm. In the
PARLANCE application, hand-crafted policies

2.2 Natural Language Generation

<bodyText confidence="0.999987">
As mentioned above, the server returns the
string to be synthesised by the Google TTS
API. This mobile framework allows for testing
of alternative approaches to NLG. In particu-
lar, we are interested in comparing a surface re-
aliser that uses CRFs against a template-based
baseline. The CRFs take semantically anno-
tated phrase structure trees as input, which it
uses to keep track of rich linguistic contexts.
Our approach has been compared with a num-
ber of competitive state-of-the art surface real-
izers (Dethlefs et al., 2013), and can be trained
from example sentences with annotations of se-
mantic slots.

2.3 Local Search and Knowledge Base
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987516129032">
For the English system, the domain database is
populated by the search Yahoo API (Bouchard
and Mika, 2013) with restaurants in San Fran-
sisco. These restaurant search results are
returned based on their longitude and lati-
tude within San Francisco for 5 main areas, 3
price categories and 52 cuisine types contain-
ing around 1,600 individual restaurants.
The Chinese database has been partially
translated from an English database for restau-
rants in Cambridge, UK and search is based
on 3 price categories, 5 areas and 35 cuisine
types having a total of 157 restaurants. Due
to the language-agnostic nature of the PAR-
LANCE system, only the name and address
Investigating application side audio compres-
sion and audio streaming over a mobile in-
ternet connection would enable further assess-
ment of the ASR and TTS components used
in the original PARLANCE system (Hastie et
al., 2013). This would allow for entire research
systems to be plugged directly into the mobile
interface without the use of third party ASR
and TTS.
Future work also involves developing a feed-
back mechanism for evaluation purposes that
does not put undue effort on the user and put
them off using the application. In addition,
this framework can be extended to leverage
hyperlocal and social information of the user
when displaying items of interest.

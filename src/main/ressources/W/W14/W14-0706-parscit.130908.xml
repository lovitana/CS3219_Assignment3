This article addresses the causal structure
of events described by verbs: whether
an event happens spontaneously or it is
caused by an external causer. We automat-
ically estimate the likelihood of external
causation of events based on the distribu-
tion of causative and anticausative uses of
verbs in the causative alternation. We train
a Bayesian model and test it on a monolin-
gual and on a bilingual input. The perfor-
mance is evaluated against an independent
scale of likelihood of external causation
based on typological data. The accuracy
of a two-way classification is 85% in both
monolingual and bilingual setting. On the
task of a three-way classification, the score
is 61% in the monolingual setting and 69%
in the bilingual setting.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999270666666667">
Ubiquitously present in human thinking, causal-
ity is encoded in language in various ways. Com-
putational approaches to causality are mostly
concerned with automatic extraction of causal
schemata (Michotte, 1963; Tversky and Kahne-
man, 1982; Gilovich et al., 1985) from sponta-
neously produced texts based on linguistic encod-
ing. A key to success in this endeavour is under-
standing how human language encodes causality.
Linguistic expressions of causality, such as
causative conjunctions, verbs, morphemes, and
constructions, are highly ambiguous, encoding not
only the real-world causality, but also the struc-
ture of discourse, as well as speakers’ attitudes
(Moeschler, 2011; Zufferey, 2012). Causality
judgements are hard to elicit in an annotation
project. This results in a low inter-annotator agree-
ment and makes the evaluation of automatic sys-
tems difficult (Bethard, 2007; Grivaz, 2012).
Our study addresses the relationship between
world-knowledge about causality and the gram-
mar of language, focusing on the causal structure
of events expressed by verbs. In current analyses,
the meaning of verbs is decomposed into multiple
predicates which can be in a temporal and causal
relation (Pustejovsky, 1995; Talmy, 2000; Levin
and Rappaport Hovav, 2005; Ramchand, 2008).

<bodyText confidence="0.999931172413793">
We propose a computational approach to the
causative alternation, illustrated in (1), in which
an event (breaking the laptop in (1)) can be disso-
ciated from its immediate causer (Adam in (1a)).
The causative alternation has been attested in al-
most all languages (Schafer, 2009), but it is re-
alised with considerable cross-linguistic variation
in the sets of alternating verbs and in the grammat-
ical encoding (Alexiadou et al., 2006; Alexiadou,
2010).
Since the causative alternation involves most
verbs, identifying the properties of verbs which al-
low them to alternate is important for developing
representations of the meaning of verbs in gen-
eral. Analysing the structural components of the
meaning of verbs proves important for tasks such
as word sense disambiguation (Lapata and Brew,
2004), semantic role labelling (M`arquez et al.,
2008), cross-linguistic transfer of semantic anno-
tation (Pad´o and Lapata, 2009; Fung et al., 2007;
van der Plas et al., 2011). The knowledge about
the likelihood of external causation might be help-
ful in the task of detecting implicit arguments of
verbs and, especially deverbal nouns (Gerber and
Chai, 2012; Roth and Frank, 2012). Knowing,
for example, that a verb expresses an externally
caused event increases the probability of an im-
plicit causer if an explicit causer is not detected in
a particular instance of the verb. Our study should

2 External Causation and the Grammar
of Language
The distinction between external and internal cau-
sation in events described by verbs is introduced
by Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1994) to account
for the fact that the alternation is blocked in some
verbs such as bloom in (2). In Levin and Rappa-
port Hovav’s account, verbs which describe ex-
ternally caused events alternate (1), while verbs
which describe internally caused events do not (2).

b. * The summer bloomed the flowers.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999870621621622">
The main objection to this proposed generali-
sation is that it does not account for the cross-
linguistic variation. Since the distinction concerns
the meaning of verbs, one could expect that the
verbs which are translations of each other alter-
nate in all languages. This is, however, often not
true. There are many verbs that do alternate in
some languages, while their counterparts in other
languages do not (Alexiadou et al., 2006; Schafer,
2009; Alexiadou, 2010). For example, appear and
arrive do not alternate in English, but their equiv-
alents in Japanese or in the Salish languages do.
To account for the variation in cross-linguistic
data Alexiadou (2010) introduces the notion of
cause-unspecified events, a category between ex-
ternally caused and internally caused events. In-
troducing gradience into the classification allows
Alexiadou to propose generalisations which apply
across languages: cause-unspecified verbs alter-
nate in all languages, while only some languages
allow the alternation if the event is either exter-
nally or internally caused. To allow the alterna-
tion in the latter cases, languages need a special
grammatical mechanism. In English, for example,
this mechanism is not available, which is why only
cause-unspecified verbs alternate. The alternation
is thus blocked in both verbs describing externally
caused and internally caused events.
Alexiadou’s account is based not only on the
observations about the availability of the alterna-
tion, but also about morphological encoding of
the alternation across languages. Unlike English,
which does not mark the alternation morphologi-
cally (note that the two versions of English verbs
in (1-3) are morphologically identical), other lan-
guages encode the alternation in different ways, as
shown in (3).

An analysis of the distribution of morpholog-
ical marking across languages leads Haspelmath
(1993) to introduce the notion of likelihood into
his account of the meaning of the alternating
verbs. In a study of 31 verbs in 21 languages
from all over the world, Haspelmath notices that
certain verbs tend to get the same kind of mark-
ing across languages. For each verb, he calcu-
lates the ratio between the number of languages
which mark the anticausative version and the num-
ber of languages which mark the causative version
of the verb. He interprets this ratio as a quantita-
tive measure of how spontaneous events described
by the verbs are. As each verb is assigned a dif-
ferent score, ranking the verbs according to the
score results in a “scale of increasing likelihood of
spontaneous occurrence”. Events with a low anti-
causative/causative ratio (e.g. boil, dry, melt) are
likely to occur spontaneously, while events with a
high ratio (e.g. break, close, split) are likely to be
caused by an external causer.

3 The Model
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999975066666667">
Our study pursues the quantitative assessment of
the likelihood of external causation in the events
described the alternating verbs. We estimate the
likelihood by means of a Bayesian model which
divides events into classes based on the distribu-
tion of causative and anticausative uses of verbs in
a corpus. By varying the settings of the model, we
address two questions discussed in the linguistic
literature: 1) Is the distinction between externally
caused and internally caused events binary,, as ar-
gued by Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1994), or are
there are intermediate classes, as argued by Alex-
iadou (2010)? and 2) Do we obtain better esti-
mation of the likelihood from cross-linguistic than
from monolingual data?
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999917787878788">
We design a probabilistic model which esti-
mates the likelihood of external causation and gen-
erates a probability distribution over a given num-
ber of event classes for each verb in a given set
of verbs. The model formalises the intuition that
an externally caused event tends to be expressed
by a verb in its causative realisation. In other
words, if the likelihood of external causation of the
event is encoded in the use of the verb which de-
scribes the event, then the causer is expected to ap-
pear frequently in the realisations of the verb. The
opposite is expected for internally caused events.
Cause-unspecified events are expected to appear
with and without the causer equally.
To take into account the two questions discussed
in the theoretical approaches, namely the number
of classes and the role of cross-linguistic data in
the classification of events, we design four ver-
sions of the model, varying the input data and the
number of classes in the output: a) monolingual
input and two classes; b) cross-linguistic input
and two classes; c) monolingual input and three
classes; d) cross-linguistic input and three classes.
The current cross-linguistic versions of the
model include only two languages, English and
German, because we test the models in a minimal
cross-linguistic setting. In principle, the approach
can be easily extended to include any number of
languages.
As it can be seen in its graphical representation
in Figure 1, the model consists of three variables
in the monolingual version and of four variables in
the cross-linguistic version.

<bodyText confidence="0.998753525">
The first variable in both versions is the set of
verbs V . This can be any given set of verbs.
The second variable is the event class of the
verb, for which we use the symbol Caus. The val-
ues of this variable depend on the assumed classi-
fication. In the two-class version, the values are
causative, representing externally caused events,
and anticausative, representing internally caused
events. In the three-class version, the variable
can take one more value, unspecified, representing
cause-unspecified events.
The third (En) and the fourth (Ge) (in the cross-
linguistic version) variables are the surface realisa-
tions of the verbs in parallel instances. These vari-
ables take three values: causative for active tran-
sitive use, anticausative for intransitive use, and
passive for passive use in the languages in ques-
tion.
We represent the relations between the variables
as a Bayesian network. The variable that rep-
resents the event class of verbs (Caus) is unob-
served. The values for the other three variables
are observed in the data source. Note that the in-
put to the model does not contain the information
about the event class at any point.
The dependence between En and Ge in the
bilingual version of the model represents the fact
that the two instances of a verb are translations
of each other, but does not represent the direction
of translation in the actual data. The form of the
instance in one language depends on the form of
the parallel instance because they express the same
meaning in the same context, regardless of the di-
rection of translation.
Assuming that the variables are related as in
Figure 1, En and Ge are conditionally indepen-
dent of V given Caus, so we can calculate the
probability of the model as in (4) for the monolin-
gual version and as in (6) for the cross-linguistic
version.

The verbs for which we estimate the likelihood are
the 354 verbs that participate in the causative alter-
nation in English, as listed by Levin (1993), and
the 26 verbs listed as alternating in a typological
study (Haspelmath, 1993).
We estimate the parameters of the model by
implementing the expectation-maximisation algo-
rithm. The algorithm is initialised by assigning
different arbitrary values to the parameters of the
model. The classification reported in the paper is
obtained after 100 iterations.
We train the classifier using the data automat-
ically extracted from an English-German parallel
corpus (Europarl (Koehn, 2005)). Both monolin-
gual and bilingual input data are extracted from
the parallel corpus. All German verbs which are
word-aligned with the alternating English verbs
listed in the literature are regarded as German
equivalents. By extracting cross-linguistic equiv-
alents automatically from a parallel corpus, we
avoid manual translation into German of the lists
of English verbs discussed in the literature. In this
way, we eliminate the judgements which would be
involved in the process of translation.
The corpus is syntactically parsed (using the
MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007)) and word-aligned
(using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)). For both
the syntactic parses and word alignments, we
reuse the data provided by Bouma et al. (2010).
We extract only the instances of verbs where
both the object (if there is one) and the sub-
ject are realised in the same clause, excluding
the instances involving syntactic movements and
coreference. Transitive instances are considered
causative realisations, intransitive anticausative.
We count passive instances separately because
they are formally transitive, but they usually do not
express the causer.
German equivalents of English alternating verbs
are extracted in two steps. First, all verbs occur-
ring as transitive, intransitive, and passive were
extracted from the German sentences that are
sentence-aligned with the English sentences con-
taining the instances of alternating verbs. These
instances were considered candidate translations.
The instances that are the translations of the En-
glish instances were then selected on the basis of
word alignments. Instances where at least one el-
ement (the verb, the head of its object, or the head
of its subject) is aligned with at least one element
in the English instance were considered aligned.
Only the instances of English verbs that are
translated with a corresponding finite verbal form
in German are extracted, excluding the cases
where English verbs are translated into a corre-
sponding non-finite form such as infinitive, nomi-
nalization, or participle in German.

We evaluate the performance of the models against
the scale of spontaneous occurrence proposed by
Haspelmath (1993), shown in (9). We expect the
verbs classified as internally caused by our models
to correspond to the verbs with a low morpholog-
ical anticausative/causative ratio (those on the left
side of the scale). The opposite is expected for
externally caused verbs. Cause-unspecified verbs
are expected to be in the middle of Haspelmath’s
scale.

scale, we discretise the scale so that the agreement

is maximised for each version of the model. For
example, the threshold which divides the verbs
into anticausative and causative in the two-way
classification is set after the verb turn.
By evaluating the performance of our models
against a typology-based measure, we avoid elic-
iting human judgements, which is a known prob-
lem in computational approaches to causality. The
downside of this approach is that such evaluation
is currently possible for a relatively small number
of verbs.

Table 1 shows all the confusion matrices of the
classifications performed automatically in com-
parison with the classifications based on the typol-
ogy rankings.1
In the two-way classification, the two versions
of the model, with monolingual and with bilingual
input, result in identical classifications. The agree-
ment of the models with the typological ranking
can be considered very good (85%). The optimal
threshold divides the verbs into two asymmetric
classes: eight verbs in the internally caused class
and eighteen in the externally caused class. The
agreement is better for the internally caused class.
In the three way-classification, the performance
of both versions of the model drops. In this set-
ting, the output of the two versions differs: there
are two verbs which are classified as externally
caused by the monolingual version and as cause-
unspecified by the bilingual version, which results
in a slightly better performance of the bilingual
version. Given the small number of evaluated
verbs, however, this tendency cannot be consid-
ered significant.
The three-way classification is more difficult
than the two-way classification, but the difficulty
is not only due to the number of classes, but also
to the fact that two of the classes are not well-
distinguished in the data. While the class of in-
ternally caused events is relatively easily distin-
guished (small number of errors in all classifica-
tions), the classes of externally caused and cause-
unspecified verbs are hard to distinguish. This
finding supports the two-way classification argued
for in the literature.

model indicates that the distinction between ex-
ternally caused and cause-unspecified verbs might
still exist. Compared to the monolingual clas-
sification, more verbs are classified as cause-
unspecified, and they are grouped in the middle of
the typological scale. Since the model takes into
account cross-linguistic variation in the realisa-
tions of the alternating verbs, the observed differ-
ence in the performance could be interpreted as a
sign that the distinction between cause-unspecified
and externally caused events does emerge in cross-
linguistic contexts.
While supporting the two-way classification of
events, our experiments do not provide a defi-
nite answer to the question of whether there are
more than two classes of events. To obtain sig-
nificant results, more verbs need to be evaluated.
However, the typological data used in our exper-
iments (Haspelmath, 1993) are not easily avail-
able. This kind of data are currently not included
in the typological resources (such as the WALS
database (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013)), but they
can, in principle, be collected from other elec-
tronic sources of language documentation, which
are increasingly available for many different lan-
guages.

The proposed distinction between externally and
internally caused events is addressed by McKoon
and Macfarland (2000). They study twenty-one
verbs defined in the linguistic literature as describ-
ing internally caused events and fourteen verbs de-
scribing externally caused events. Their corpus
study shows that the appearance of these verbs as
causative (transitive) and anticausative (intransi-
tive) cannot be used as a diagnostic for the kind
of meaning that has been attributed to them.
Since internally caused verbs do not enter the
alternation, they were expected to be found in in-
transitive clauses only. This, however, was not the
case. The probability for some of these verbs to
occur in a transitive clause is actually quite high
(0.63 for the verb corrode, for example). More
importantly, no difference was found in the prob-
ability of the verbs denoting internally caused and
externally caused events to occur as transitive or
as intransitive. This means that the acceptability
judgements used in the qualitative analysis do not
apply to all the verbs in question, and, also, not to
all the instances of these verbs.

Even though the most obvious prediction con-
cerning the corpus instances of the two groups of
verbs was not confirmed, the corpus data were
still found to support the distinction between the
two groups. Examining 50 randomly selected in-
stances of transitive uses of each of the studied
verbs, McKoon and Macfarland (2000) find that,
when used in a transitive clause, internally caused
change-of-state verbs tend to occur with a limited
set of subjects, while externally caused verbs can
occur with a wider range of subjects. This differ-
ence is statistically significant.
The relation between frequencies of certain uses
and the lexical semantics of English verbs has
been explored by Merlo and Stevenson (2001) in
the context of automatic verb classification. Merlo
and Stevenson (2001) show that information col-
lected from instances of verbs in a corpus can be
used to distinguish between three different classes
which all include verbs that alternate between
transitive and intransitive use. The classes in ques-
tion are manner of motion verbs (10), which alter-
nate only in a limited number of languages, exter-
nally caused change of state verbs (11), alternating
across languages, and performance/creation verbs,
which are not lexical causatives (12).

One of the most useful features for the classi-
fication proved to be the causativity feature. It
represents the fact that, in the causative alterna-
tion, the same lexical items can occur both as sub-
jects and as objects of the same verb. This feature
sets apart the two causative classes from the per-
formance class.
In the context of psycholinguistic empirical ap-
proaches to encoding causality in verbs, it has
been established that assigning a causal relation
to a sequence of events can be influenced by the
native languages (Wolff et al., 2009a; Wolff and
Ventura, 2009b). English speakers, for instance,
tend to assign causal relations more than Russian
speakers.
In our study, we draw on the fact that the se-
mantic properties of verbs are reflected in the way
they are used in a corpus, established by the pre-
vious studies. We explore this relationship further,
relating it to a deeper semantic analysis and to the
typological distribution of grammatical features.

The experiments presented in this article provide
empirical evidence that contribute to a better un-
derstanding of the relationship between the causal
semantics of verbs, their formal morphological
and syntactic properties, and the variation in their
use. We have shown that the likelihood of external
causation of events is encoded in the distribution
of the causative and anticausative uses of verbs.
Two classes of events, externally caused and inter-
nally caused events, can be distinguished automat-
ically based on corpus data.
In future work, we will further investigate the
question of whether there are more than two
classes of events and how they are distinguished.
We will explore potential tendencies indicated by
our findings. We will apply the approach proposed
in this article to an extended data set. On one hand,
we will collect typological data for more verbs, ex-
ploring possibilities of automatic data extraction.
On the other hand, we will include more languages
in the model to ensure a better representation of
cross-linguistic variation.

<abstract confidence="0.999578947368421">This article addresses the causal structure of events described by verbs: whether an event happens spontaneously or it is caused by an external causer. We automatically estimate the likelihood of external causation of events based on the distribution of causative and anticausative uses of verbs in the causative alternation. We train a Bayesian model and test it on a monolingual and on a bilingual input. The performance is evaluated against an independent scale of likelihood of external causation based on typological data. The accuracy of a two-way classification is 85% in both monolingual and bilingual setting. On the task of a three-way classification, the score is 61% in the monolingual setting and 69% in the bilingual setting.</abstract>

We estimate the likelihood by means of a Bayesian model which divides events into classes based on the distribution of causative and anticausative uses of verbs in a corpus. By varying the settings of the model, we address two questions discussed in the linguistic literature: 1) Is the distinction between externally caused and internally caused events binary,, as argued by Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1994), or are there are intermediate classes, as argued by Alexiadou (2010)? and 2) Do we obtain better estimation of the likelihood from cross-linguistic than from monolingual data? 41 We design a probabilistic model which estimates the likelihood of external causation and generates a probability distribution over a given number of event classes for each verb in a given set of verbs. The model formalises the intuition that an externally caused event tends to be expressed by a verb in its causative realisation. In other words, if the likelihood of external causation of the event is encoded in the use of the verb which describes the event, then the causer is expected </context>

By extracting cross-linguistic equivalents automatically from a parallel corpus, we avoid manual translation into German of the lists of English verbs discussed in the literature. In this way, we eliminate the judgements which would be involved in the process of translation. The corpus is syntactically parsed (using the MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007)) and word-aligned (using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)). For both the syntactic parses and word alignments, we reuse the data provided by Bouma et al. (2010). We extract only the instances of verbs where both the object (if there is one) and the subject are realised in the same clause, excluding the instances involving syntactic movements and coreference. Transitive instances are considered causative realisations, intransitive anticausative. We count passive instances separately because they are formally transitive, but they usually do not express the causer. German equivalents of English alternating verbs are extracted in two steps. First, all verbs occurring as transitive, intransitive, and passive were extracted from the German sentences that a</context>

Unlike English, which does not mark the alternation morphologically (note that the two versions of English verbs in (1-3) are morphologically identical), other languages encode the alternation in different ways, as shown in (3). Causative Anticausative Mongolian xajl-uul-ax xajl-ax ’melt’ ’melt’ (3) Russian rasplavit rasplavit-sja ’melt’ ’melt’ Japanese atum-eru atum-aru ’gather’ ’gather’ An analysis of the distribution of morphological marking across languages leads Haspelmath (1993) to introduce the notion of likelihood into his account of the meaning of the alternating verbs. In a study of 31 verbs in 21 languages from all over the world, Haspelmath notices that certain verbs tend to get the same kind of marking across languages. For each verb, he calculates the ratio between the number of languages which mark the anticausative version and the number of languages which mark the causative version of the verb. He interprets this ratio as a quantitative measure of how spontaneous events described by the verbs are. As each verb is assigned a different score, ranking the ver</context>

We estimate the parameters of the model by implementing the expectation-maximisation algorithm. The algorithm is initialised by assigning different arbitrary values to the parameters of the model. The classification reported in the paper is obtained after 100 iterations. We train the classifier using the data automatically extracted from an English-German parallel corpus (Europarl (Koehn, 2005)). Both monolingual and bilingual input data are extracted from the parallel corpus.

Instances where at least one element (the verb, the head of its object, or the head of its subject) is aligned with at least one element in the English instance were considered aligned. Only the instances of English verbs that are translated with a corresponding finite verbal form in German are extracted, excluding the cases where English verbs are translated into a corresponding non-finite form such as infinitive, nominalization, or participle in German. 4.2 Evaluation We evaluate the performance of the models against the scale of spontaneous occurrence proposed by Haspelmath (1993), shown in (9). We expect the verbs classified as internally caused by our models to correspond to the verbs with a low morphological anticausative/causative ratio (those on the left side of the scale). The opposite is expected for externally caused verbs. Cause-unspecified verbs are expected to be in the middle of Haspelmath’s scale.

Since the model takes into account cross-linguistic variation in the realisations of the alternating verbs, the observed difference in the performance could be interpreted as a sign that the distinction between cause-unspecified and externally caused events does emerge in crosslinguistic contexts. While supporting the two-way classification of events, our experiments do not provide a definite answer to the question of whether there are more than two classes of events. To obtain significant results, more verbs need to be evaluated. However, the typological data used in our experiments (Haspelmath, 1993) are not easily available. This kind of data are currently not included in the typological resources (such as the WALS database (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013)), but they can, in principle, be collected from other electronic sources of language documentation, which are increasingly available for many different languages. 6 Related Work The proposed distinction between externally and internally caused events is addressed by McKoon and Macfarland (2000).

The causative alternation has been attested in almost all languages (Schafer, 2009), but it is realised with considerable cross-linguistic variation in the sets of alternating verbs and in the grammatical encoding (Alexiadou et al., 2006; Alexiadou, 2010). Since the causative alternation involves most verbs, identifying the properties of verbs which allow them to alternate is important for developing representations of the meaning of verbs in general. Analysing the structural components of the meaning of verbs proves important for tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Lapata and Brew, 2004), semantic role labelling (M`arquez et al., 2008), cross-linguistic transfer of semantic annotation (Pad´o and Lapata, 2009; Fung et al., 2007; van der Plas et al., 2011). The knowledge about the likelihood of external causation might be helpful in the task of detecting implicit arguments of verbs and, especially deverbal nouns (Gerber and Chai, 2012; Roth and Frank, 2012). Knowing, for example, that a verb expresses an externally caused event increases the probability of an implicit causer if an explicit causer is not detected in a particular instance of the verb.

Computational approaches to causality are mostly concerned with automatic extraction of causal schemata (Michotte, 1963; Tversky and Kahneman, 1982; Gilovich et al., 1985) from spontaneously produced texts based on linguistic encoding. A key to success in this endeavour is understanding how human language encodes causality. Linguistic expressions of causality, such as causative conjunctions, verbs, morphemes, and constructions, are highly ambiguous, encoding not only the real-world causality, but also the structure of discourse, as well as speakers’ attitudes (Moeschler, 2011; Zufferey, 2012).

Causality judgements are hard to elicit in an annotation project. This results in a low inter-annotator agreement and makes the evaluation of automatic systems difficult (Bethard, 2007; Grivaz, 2012). Our study addresses the relationship between world-knowledge about causality and the grammar of language, focusing on the causal structure of events expressed by verbs. In current analyses, the meaning of verbs is decomposed into multiple predicates which can be in a temporal and causal relation (Pustejovsky, 1995; Talmy, 2000; Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005; Ramchand, 2008). </context>

The knowledge about the likelihood of external causation might be helpful in the task of detecting implicit arguments of verbs and, especially deverbal nouns (Gerber and Chai, 2012; Roth and Frank, 2012). Knowing, for example, that a verb expresses an externally caused event increases the probability of an implicit causer if an explicit causer is not detected in a particular instance of the verb.

The flowers suddenly bloomed. b. * The summer bloomed the flowers. The main objection to this proposed generalisation is that it does not account for the crosslinguistic variation. Since the distinction concerns the meaning of verbs, one could expect that the verbs which are translations of each other alternate in all languages. This is, however, often not true. There are many verbs that do alternate in some languages, while their counterparts in other languages do not (Alexiadou et al., 2006; Schafer, 2009; Alexiadou, 2010). For example, appear and arrive do not alternate in English, but their equivalents in Japanese or in the Salish languages do. To account for the variation in cross-linguistic data Alexiadou (2010) introduces the notion of cause-unspecified events, a category between externally caused and internally caused events. Introducing gradience into the classification allows Alexiadou to propose generalisations which apply across languages: cause-unspecified verbs alternate in all languages, while only some languages allow the alternation if the event is either externally or internall</context>

The performance is evaluated against an independent scale of likelihood of external causation based on typological data. The accuracy of a two-way classification is 85% in both monolingual and bilingual setting. On the task of a three-way classification, the score is 61% in the monolingual setting and 69% in the bilingual setting. 1 Introduction Ubiquitously present in human thinking, causality is encoded in language in various ways. Computational approaches to causality are mostly concerned with automatic extraction of causal schemata (Michotte, 1963; Tversky and Kahneman, 1982; Gilovich et al., 1985) from spontaneously produced texts based on linguistic encoding. A key to success in this endeavour is understanding how human language encodes causality. Linguistic expressions of causality, such as causative conjunctions, verbs, morphemes, and constructions, are highly ambiguous, encoding not only the real-world causality, but also the structure of discourse, as well as speakers’ attitudes (Moeschler, 2011; Zufferey, 2012).

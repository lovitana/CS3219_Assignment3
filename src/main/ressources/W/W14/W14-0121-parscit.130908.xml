The paper describes the structure and current
state of RuThes – thesaurus of Russian lan-
guage, constructed as a linguistic ontology.
We compare RuThes structure with the
WordNet structure, describe principles for in-
clusion of multiword expressions, types of re-
lations, experiments and applications based on
RuThes. For a long time RuThes has been de-
veloped within various NLP and information-
retrieval projects, and now it became available
for public use.

Since its appearance Princeton WordNet has at-
tracted a lot of attention of researchers and other
specialists in natural language processing and
information retrieval (Fellbaum, 1998). National
wordnets for many languages in the world were
initiated.
For developing a wordnet for a new language,
several approaches can be applied. The first ap-
proach is based on automated or manual transla-
tion of Princeton WordNet (Balkova et al., 2008;
Linden and Carlson, 2010). The second approach
consists in creating of a wordnet from scratch
using language-specific dictionaries and corpora
(Climent et al., 1996; Azarowa, 2008; Kunze and
Lemnitzer, 2010). This approach often implies
the modification of the initial set of Princeton
WordNet lexical relationships, introduction and
justification of new relations, which usually re-
quires additional time-consuming efforts (Ma-
ziarz et al., 2013; Pedersen et al., 2012).
At least three attempts to create a Russian
wordnet are known. RussNet (Azarowa, 2008)
began to be developed from scratch and at this
moment continues to be quite small (not more
than 20 thousand synsets). Two other Russian
wordnets were generated using automated trans-
lation (Gelfenbeyn et al., 2003; Balkova et al.,
2008). The former one is publicly available
(http://wordnet.ru/) but represents the di-
rect translation from Princeton Wordnet without
any manual revision. The webpage of the latter
one ceased to exist.
The structure of Princeton WordNet (and other
wordnets) is based on sets of partial synonyms –
synsets, organized in hierarchical part-of-speech-
based lexical nets according mainly to hypony-
my-hypernymy relations. Every part-of-speech
net has its own system of relations.
Wordnets are often referred as linguistic or
lexical ontologies (Magnini and Speranza, 2002;
Veale and Hao, 2007), synsets of WordNet are
often considered as lexicalized concepts. How-
ever, wordnets are mainly intended to describe
lexical relations, what is quite different from the
primary aim of ontologies to describe knowledge
about the world, not about the language (Buite-
laar et al., 2009; Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004).
This difference reveals, for example, in the
above mentioned division of wordnets to differ-
ent part-of-speech subnets, because a part of
speech cannot be a divisive feature in construc-
tion of ontologies.
In this paper we will consider the structure and
current state of Thesaurus of Russian language
(linguistic ontology) RuThes, which for a long
time has been developed within various NLP and
information-retrieval projects (Loukachevitch
and Dobrov, 2002), and now it is prepared to
become available for public use. In this resource
we attempted to create a linguistically moti-
vated ontology (not a lexical net), based on the
denotational part of lexical senses and concept-
based (not lexical) relations. At present, RuThes
comprises more than 158 thousand unique words
and expressions, which are structured into 53.5
thousand concepts.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Sec-
tion 2 is devoted to the comparison of units in
ontologies, wordnets and information-retrieval
thesauri. In Section 3 main components of
RuThes are considered. In Section 4 we describe
several applications and the evaluation of
RuThes. At last in Section 5 we describe our li-
censing policy for RuThes distribution.

2 Units in Ontologies, Wordnets and
Information-Retrieval Thesauri
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990808">
Ontologies are often considered as logical theo-
ries, which should be independent of natural lan-
guage (Buitelaar et al., 2009; Smith, 2004). The
general recommendations on the ontology con-
cepts (classes) are usually described as follows
(Noy and McGuinness, 2001; Nirenburg and
Raskin, 2004):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.947130857142857">
• one needs to distinguish the concept and
its name, i.e. synonyms do not represent
different classes, synonyms are just differ-
ent names of the concepts
• a concept should be distinctly different
from its parent and from the concepts at
the same level (sibling concepts).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9979605">
However, to use ontologies in natural lan-
guage processing, concepts of ontologies should
be associated with language expressions and
structures. In (Maedche and Zacharias, 2002;
Buitelaar et al., 2006; Buitelaar et al., 2009) spe-
cial models for linking natural language expres-
sions and ontological entities are proposed.
From another point of view, an ontology can-
not be fully independent of natural language. Ch.
Brewster and colleagues (Brewster et al., 2005)
stress that people manipulate concepts through
words. In all known ontologies the words are
used to represent concepts. Therefore, phenome-
na that are not verbalized, cannot be modeled.
Y. Wilks (Wilks, 2008) asserts that the symbols
in representation languages are fundamentally
based on the natural language.
WordNet was created as a lexical rather than
ontological resource (Fellbaum, 1998). However,
over time, the growing importance of the onto-
logical research, as well as the similarity of the
WordNet noun hierarchy with an ontology be-
came apparent (Miller and Hristea, 2006).
At the same time there exist a lot of deficien-
cies of WordNet descriptions from the ontologi-
cal point of view (Guarino, 1998). Numerous
examples of confusion between a concept and its
names can be found in WordNet (Loukachevitch,
2009). Separate synsets are introduced for dif-
ferent ways of naming the same entities includ-
ing the support of specific hierarchies for differ-
ent parts of speech, for description of old and
new names of the same entities, specific word
usage in different dialects of the language or text
genres (moke - donkey, nose - nozzle) etc. This is
due to the fact that the basic relation in WordNet
is the synonymy, based on the principle of subs-
titution of one for another in sentences (Fell-
baum, 1998). Some of new wordnets enhance the
diversity of lexical relations between words to
describe mainly their derivational links (Azaro-
wa, 2008; Derwojedowa et al., 2008; Maziarz et
al., 2013; Bosch et al., 2008).
However, it was supposed in (Edmonds and
Hirst, 2002; Hirst, 2009) that a fine-grained hie-
rarchy is inappropriate as a model for the rela-
tionship between the senses of near-synonyms in
a lexicon for any practical use in tasks such as
machine translation and other applications. They
assert that, &amp;quot;what is required is a very coarse-
grained conceptual hierarchy so that whole clus-
ters of near-synonyms are mapped to a single
node: their core meaning”.
If to look at information-retrieval thesauri as
representative sources of the terminology and
domain knowledge one can see that most stan-
dards and guidelines for information-retrieval
thesauri construction highlight the connection
between the terms and concepts of a subject field
(ISO 2788-1986, 1986; Z39.19, 2005). So the
American standard Z39.19 points out that a term
is one or more words referring to a concept
(Z39.19, 2005). A concept is considered as a unit
of a thought, regardless of the terms that express
them.
Creating RuThes as an ontology with concept-
based (not lexical) relations, we assumed that the
concept-oriented approach to the lexical know-
ledge representation gives the possibility of bet-
ter matching between languages (Edmonds and
Hirst, 2002), more natural connection with do-
main terminologies, which are inherently con-
cept-based (Z39.19, 2005); and more reliable
logical inference based on current ontological
research (Masolo et al., 2003; Guarino, 2009;
Guizzardi, 2011).

3 RuThes linguistic ontology
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.916276571428571">
RuThes Thesaurus of Russian language can be
called a linguistic ontology for natural language
processing, i.e. an ontology, where the majority
of concepts are introduced on the basis of actual
language expressions.
In construction of RuThes we combined three
different methodologies:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995762818181818">
• methods of construction of information-
retrieval thesauri (concept-based units, a
small set of relation types, rules of multi-
word expression inclusion)
• development of wordnets for various
languages (language-motivated units, de-
tailed sets of synonyms, description of
ambiguous expressions)
• ontology research (concepts as main
units, strictness of relation description, ne-
cessity of many-step inference).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983013">
RuThes is a hierarchical network of concepts.
Each concept has a name, relations with other
concepts, a set of language expressions (words,
phrases, terms) whose meanings correspond to
the concept.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998871">
3.1 RuThes units
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999903153846154">
In RuThes, a unit is presented not by a set of
similar words or terms, as it is done in the
WordNet thesaurus, but by a concept – as a unit
of thought, which can be associated with several
synonymic language expressions. Every concept
should have distinctions from related concepts,
which are independent from context and should
be expressed in specific set of relations or
associated language expressions – text entries.
Words and phrases, which meanings are
represented as references to the same concepts of
the thesaurus, are called ontological synonyms.
Ontological synonyms can comprise:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99250875">
• words belonging to different parts of
speech (stabilization, stabilize, stabilized)
– therefore the number of RuThes
concepts is approximately 2.5 times less
than in a wordnet-like resource of the
same size. Text entries are provided with
part-of speech information;
• language expressions relating to different
linguistic styles, genres;
• idioms and even free multiword ex-
pressions (for example, synonymous to
single words).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.926217666666667">
Each concept should have a clear, univocal
and concise name. Such names often help to
express, delimit the denotational scope of the
concept. Besides, such names facilitate the ana-
lysis of the results of natural language
processing.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.916628625">
Name of a concept can be:
• one of unambiguous text entries;
• an unambiguous multiword expression;
• a pair of synonyms that uniquely iden-
tifies the concept;
• an ambiguous word with a relator similar
to those used in traditional information
retrieval thesauri (Z39.19, 2005).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997607545454546">
If necessary, a concept may have a gloss,
which is not a part of the concept name.
Language expressions that may give rise to a
separate concept in RuThes belong not only to
the general vocabulary, but also can be terms of
specific subject domains within the broad scope
of social life (economy, law, international
relations, politics, transport, banks, etc.), so-
called socio-political domain (Loukache-
vitch and Dobrov, 2004).
This is due to the fact that many professional
concepts, terms, and slang of these domains pe-
netrate easily into the general language, and can
be widely discussed in mass media. Besides,
such a scope of concepts facilitates the app-
lication of RuThes in specialized subdomains of
the broad socio-political domain. Examples of
such concepts in RuThes include: EMERGENCY
LOAN, TAX EXEMPTION, IMPORT TAX, DE-
MOGRAPHIC INDICATOR etc.
In fact, we subdivide the whole scope of
RuThes concepts to:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.906909833333333">
• General Lexicon comprising concepts
that can be met in various specific
domains. In this, General Lexicon app-
roximately corresponds to the Factotum
domain in the Wordnet domain set
(Gonzalez et al., 2012; Bentivogli et al.,
2004),
• and Socio-political Thesaurus con-
taining thematically oriented lexemes and
multiword expressions as well as domain-
specific terms of the broad sociopolitical
domain.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999728263157895">
After a concept has been introduced, an expert
searches for all possible synonyms or derivative
synonyms (that is derivates preserving the sense
of an initial word), single words and phrases that
can be associated with this concept. For example,
a concept ДУШЕВНОЕ СТРАДАНИЕ (wound
in the soul) has more than 20 text entries inclu-
ding such as: боль, боль в душе, в душе на-
болело, душа болит, душа саднит, душевная
пытка, душевная рана, душевный недуг,
наболеть, рана в душе, рана в сердце, рана
души, саднить (several English translations
may be as follows: wound, emotional wound,
pain in the soul etc.).
At present RuThes includes 53.5 thousand
concepts, 158 thousand unique text entries (75
thousand single words), 178 thousand concept-
text entry relations, more than 215 thousand
conceptual relations.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999902">
3.2 Multiword expressions in RuThes
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994197637931034">
One of difficult issues in wordnet development is
inclusion of synsets based on senses of multi-
word expressions, for example noun compounds
(Bentivogli and Pianta, 2004; Agirre et al., 2006;
Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2010). Two main ques-
tions are usually discussed here: what are the
principles of inclusion of multiword expressions
(especially compositional or semi-compositional
ones) and what types of relations should connect
a multiword expression and its components in
the wordnet structure.
In RuThes introduction of concepts based on
multiword expressions is not restricted and even
encouraged if (and only if) this concept adds
some new information to knowledge described in
RuThes.
Such additional information may be
subdivided into several types.
A concept denotes an important entity. So in
our Russia-oriented resource ПРЕЗИДЕНТ
РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ (Russian Pre-
sident) is an example of such a concept. Another
variant of the same issue is the existence of im-
portant parts or participants for an entity or
event. So, for АРЕНДА (lease) concept, such
additional concepts as АРЕНДНАЯ ПЛАТА
(lease payment), АРЕНДНЫЙ ДОГОВОР (lea-
se agreement), АРЕНДНОЕ ИМУЩЕСТВО
(leasehold property) are introduced, because they
present important issues of lease services. At the
same time concept АРЕНДНЫЙ ДОГОВОР
(lease agreement) is an important subtype of
concept ГРАЖДАНСКО-ПРАВОВОЙ ДОГО-
ВОР (legal agreement).
A new concept has relations that do not follow
from the component structure of an underlying
multiword expression. This is a reason to intro-
duce concept ИЗБРАНИЕ ПАПЫ РИМСКОГО
(papal election) - it has a relation to concept
КОНКЛАВ (papal conclave). Another example
is concept ТЮНИНГ АВТОМОБИЛЯ (car
tuning) having relations to concepts
АВТОСЕРВИС (auto service).
A new multiword-based concept has a text
entry that is not motivated by the component
structure of a basic expression, for example, con-
cept ЗАСНУТЬ ЗА РУЛЕМ describes also an
&amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; synonym заснуть во время дви-
жения (compare English expressions falling
asleep at the wheel and falling asleep while dri-
ving). Also this concept has an &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; rela-
tion to concept ДОРОЖНО-ТРАНСПОРТНОЕ
ПРОИСШЕСТВИЕ (road accident).
At last, an important additional factor, which
can stimulate inclusion of a concept to the
thesaurus, is the ambiguity of components of an
unambiguous phrase, such as положение дел
(state of affairs).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994329">
3.3 RuThes relations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999516617021276">
RuThes relations are of conceptual nature, not
lexical ones. It is not a simple task to choose an
appropriate set of relations for such a broad and
diverse scope of concepts. RuThes has a small
set of conceptual relations consisting of three
main relations that are also applicable to a lot of
various domains (Dobrov and Loukachevitch,
2006) and describe the most important links of a
concept.
The first relation is the traditional hyponymic
(taxonomic) relation. To establish such relations
we apply additional tests similar to ones used in
ontology development. The tests are directed to
avoid incorrect use of taxonomic relations and
not to mix them up with other types of relations,
because errors in relation types degrade logical
inference Gangemi et al., 2001).
We consider role-type relations as especially
dangerous ones when a role concept (such as
EMPLOYEE) is located as a parent concept for a
type (as PERSON) (see discussion about roles
and related problems in (Guarino, 1998;
Gangemi et al., 2001; Fellbaum, 2002)).
Therefore establishing the taxonomic
relationship we also check the fulfillment of the
following principle: every instance of a child
concept should be at the same time the instance
of a parent concept (not every person is an emp-
loyee).
The second conceptual relation used in
RuThes is the part-whole relation. The part-
whole relations can be applied in various
domains, exist in diverse forms. Therefore in
computer resources different approaches
representing these relations can be taken
(Winston et al., 1987; Guarino, 2009; Sowa,
2000). So, for example, the tradition to describe
part-whole relations in wordnets differs
considerably from the guidelines of information-
retrieval thesauri construction (Z39.19, 2005;
Fellbaum, 1998).
In RuThes we use the generalized part-whole
relation, which means that besides traditional
types of part-whole relations (physical parts,
process parts), relations between the following
types of entities can be considered as part-whole
relations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.986949933333333">
• an attribute and its bearer,
• a role or a participant of a situation and
the situation: investor - investing, player -
playing (compare (Loebe, 2007)),
• entities and situations in the encompass-
ing sphere of activity: industrial plant -
industry, tennis racket - tennis, tennis
player - tennis. So these subtypes of part-
whole relations in RuThes play the role of
so-called WordNet domains, which were
introduced to alleviate “tennis problem” –
the lack of relations between synsets in-
volved to the same situation or domain
(Bentivogli et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al.,
2012)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.97065815">
and several others.
In such a broad scope RuThes part-whole rela-
tions are close to so called internal relations
(parthood, constitution, quality inherence, and
participation) as described in (Guarino, 2009).
At the same time RuThes part-whole relations
have a very important restriction: a concept-part
should be related to its whole during normal ex-
istence of its instances: so called inseparable
parts or mandatary wholes (Guizzardi, 2011).
From this point of view, TREE concept is not
described as part of FOREST concept, because
trees can grow in many places, not only in fo-
rests.
Thus, the inference mechanism can rely on the
chain of part-whole relations so we use the tran-
sitivity of such restricted part-whole relations
(Guizzardi, 2011).
Let us see examples of the transitivity chain of
part-whole relations:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99873625">
• (whole (ACCUSED PERSON, PUBLIC
PROSECUTION),
• whole (PUBLIC PROSECUTION ,
JUDICIAL TRIAL ),
• whole (JUDICIAL TRIAL, JUDICIAL
PROCEEDINGS))
•  whole (ACCUSED PERSON,
JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999219714285714">
The next relation in RuThes ontology is un-
symmetrical association asc1-asc2, which
represents external dependence in ontological
terms (Gangemi et al., 2001; Guarino, 2009).
This relation is established between two con-
cepts C1 and C2 when two requirements are ful-
filled:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983305166666667">
• neither taxonomic nor part-whole rela-
tions can be established between C1 and C2
in RuThes linguistic ontology,
• the following assertion is true: C2 exists
means C1 exists (necessarily existent enti-
ties are excluded from consideration).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9946635">
These two conditions mean that concept C2
(dependent concept) externally depends on C1:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.972311">
asc1 (C2, C1) = asc2 (C1, C2)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9850505">
Examples of dependent concepts for
AUTOMOBILE concepts are as follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9995012">
• asc2 (AUTOMOBILE, AUTOMOTIVE
INDUSTRY): concept AUTOMOTIVE
INDUSTRY exists only if concept
AUTOMOBILE exists;
• asc2 (FOREST, TREE) concept FOREST
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993875">
exists only if concept TREE exists.
Relations of ontological dependence are appli-
cable in various domains, therefore they are
usually used in top-level ontologies (Sowa, 2000;
Masolo et al., 2003; Grenon, 2003). Besides in
(Kumar and Smith, 2004) authors discuss the
importance of such a relation for the biology
domain: cell movement cannot exist without
cells. It is the first time when such relations are
basic relations for a linguistic ontology.
An additional advantage of using this relation
in linguistic ontologies consists in its usefulness
for description of links between a concept based
on the sense of a compositional multiword ex-
pression and concepts corresponding to the com-
ponents of this multiword expression.

So a multiword-based concept (for example,
AUTOMOBILE RACING) is described as a de-
pendent concept and its component concept
(AUTOMOBILE) as a main concept. This allows
us to introduce concepts based on various types
of multiword expressions as described in section
3.2 and establish their necessary relations.
To conclude this section, we would like to
stress there exists the similarity between all
above-mentioned relations, which determines
their considerable importance in concept descrip-
tion. These relations are established when con-
cept instances or concepts themselves should
coexist, what means that using these relations,
we describe the most inherent (and, therefore,
reliable) relations of concepts.

RuThes lingustic ontology provides the detailed
coverage of single words, expressions and senses
of contemporary written Russian (mainly, news
articles, laws and official documents). The quali-
ty of descriptions originates from several
sources.
First, since 1996 RuThes was used in various
projects with governmental bodies and commer-
cial organizations (in such applications as con-
ceptual indexing in information-retrieval sys-
tems, knowledge-based text categorization, au-
tomatic summarization of single and multiple
documents, question-answering etc.) and every
project gave us the possibility to improve de-
scriptions of lexical senses, to reveal useful ex-
pressions.
Second, 200 thousand words in a dictionary
form (so called lemmas) ordered in decreasing
frequency were extracted from the document fre-
quency list of information-retrieval system
RUSSIA (www.uisrussia.msu.ru/), in
which contemporary Russian legal documents
and newspaper materials are stored (2 million
documents). The contemporary usage of these
lemmas (distinct from proper names) was
checked out during ten years of work mainly in
news collections of online news services.
In combination with other techniques we ap-
plied RuThes in tasks of Russian Information
Retrieval Evaluation Seminar (ROMIP) (Dobrov
et al., 2004). So in 2007 we tested our know-
ledge-based text categorization system in
ROMIP text categorization evaluation (Ageev et
al., 2008a). The task was to automatically classi-
fy documents of 1.5 mln. webpages using 247
categories (Russian part of DMOZ categories
www.dmoz.org). The training collection in-
cluded 300 thousand documents with DMOZ
category labels.
For every category, we created a Boolean ex-
pression over a relative small number of “sup-
porting” concepts of the thesaurus. After that
initial Boolean expressions were expanded on the
basis of properties of the thesaurus relations. Fi-
nal Boolean expressions usually include much
more disjunctive and conjunctive components,
sometimes in hundreds times more. Thus, these
expanded Boolean descriptions of categories
were used in automatic categorization of docu-
ments.
For example, Music category was described
with single concept MUSICAL ARTY, where Y
means full expansion to lower levels of the hie-
rarchy including hyponyms, parts and dependent
concepts. So the full Boolean expression for this
category looks like a disjunction of more than
400 concepts: ADAGIO v ACCORDION
v ... v ORCHESTRA v ...).
The aim of our experiment was to obtain the
best results of text categorization by minimal
human efforts. The given system of 247 catego-
ries was described during eight hours by two
knowledge engineers (overall time) (Ageev et al.
2008a). Fig. 1 demonstrates the performance of
the created categorization system (thescateg) in
comparison to machine learning approaches
(SVM-based runs).
It is possible to see that the results of the
knowledge-based system are considerably better.
In our opinion, the achievement of such results is
due to large volumes of knowledge described in
RuThes and its consistent representation. Be-
sides, in this evaluation machine learning ap-
proaches should process a highly inconsistent
training collection because DMOZ manual labels
were provided for the whole websites, but the
contents of specific pages from these sites could
be quite different from title pages.
In fact, more than twenty knowledge-based
text categorization systems were implemented on
the RuThes basis.
At last, Socio-political thesaurus (see section
3.1) is used as a search and visualization tool in
several information-retrieval systems. Also in
experiments the usefullness of Socio-political
thesaurus for processing of long information-
retrieval queries and as a basis for text clustering
was proved (Ageev et al., 2008b; Dobrov and
Pavlov, 2010).

At present, RuThes thesaurus is partially in-
volved in several commercial projects with other
organizations and therefore it cannot be pub-
lished as a whole. But the interest in a large the-
saurus of Russian language is considerably grow-
ing therefore we decided to publish RuThes par-
tially.
The first publicly available version of RuThes
(RuThes-lite) contains around 50 thousand
words and expressions and is available from
http://www.labinform.ru/ruthes/index
.htm. The next version including 100 thousand
text entries will be published in the beginning of
2014. We distribute RuThes-lite as free for non-
commercial use (Attribution-NonCommercial-

<bodyText confidence="0.999439764705882">
In this paper we presented RuThes linguistic on-
tology. This resource has been developed for a
long time (more than fifteen years) and was used
as a resource in various applications of NLP and
information retrieval such as conceptual index-
ing, semantic search, query expansion, automatic
text categorization and clustering, automatic
summarization of a single document and multiple
documents.
Now we decided to provide public access to
RuThes and in this paper we described its struc-
ture and current state. We hope that this resource,
having the broad and detailed lexical and termi-
nological coverage of contemporary Russian
news articles and official documents, will facili-
tate development of NLP techniques and re-
search for Russian language.

Two main questions are usually discussed here: what are the principles of inclusion of multiword expressions (especially compositional or semi-compositional ones) and what types of relations should connect a multiword expression and its components in the wordnet structure. In RuThes introduction of concepts based on multiword expressions is not restricted and even encouraged if (and only if) this concept adds some new information to knowledge described in RuThes. Such additional information may be subdivided into several types. A concept denotes an important entit</context>

The first approach is based on automated or manual translation of Princeton WordNet (Balkova et al., 2008; Linden and Carlson, 2010). The second approach consists in creating of a wordnet from scratch using language-specific dictionaries and corpora (Climent et al., 1996; Azarowa, 2008; Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2010). This approach often implies the modification of the initial set of Princeton WordNet lexical relationships, introduction and justification of new relations, which usually requires additional time-consuming efforts (Maziarz et al., 2013; Pedersen et al., 2012). At least three attempts to create a Russian wordnet are known. RussNet (Azarowa, 2008) began to be developed from scratch and at this moment continues to be quite small (not more than 20 thousand synsets). Two other Russian wordnets were generated using automated translation (Gelfenbeyn et al., 2003; Balkova</context>

Some of new wordnets enhance the diversity of lexical relations between words to describe mainly their derivational links (Azarowa, 2008; Derwojedowa et al., 2008; Maziarz et al., 2013; Bosch et al., 2008). However, it was supposed in (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002; Hirst, 2009) that a fine-grained hierarchy is inappropriate as a model for the relationship between the senses of near-synonyms in a lexicon for any practical use in tasks such as machine translation and other applications. They assert that, &amp;quot;what is required is a very coarsegrained conceptual hierarchy so that whole clusters of near-synonyms are mapped to a single node: their core meaning”.

At present RuThes includes 53.5 thousand concepts, 158 thousand unique text entries (75 thousand single words), 178 thousand concepttext entry relations, more than 215 thousand conceptual relations. 3.2 Multiword expressions in RuThes One of difficult issues in wordnet development is inclusion of synsets based on senses of multiword expressions, for example noun compounds (Bentivogli and Pianta, 2004; Agirre et al., 2006; Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2010). Two main questions are usually discussed here: what are the principles of inclusion of multiword expressions (especially compositional or semi-compositional ones) and what types of relations should connect a multiword expression and its components in the wordnet structure. In RuThes introduction of concepts based on multiword expressions is not restricted and even encouraged if (and only if) this concept adds some new information to knowledge described in RuThes. Such additional information may be subdivided into several types. A concept denot</context>

Besides, such a scope of concepts facilitates the application of RuThes in specialized subdomains of the broad socio-political domain. Examples of such concepts in RuThes include: EMERGENCY LOAN, TAX EXEMPTION, IMPORT TAX, DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATOR etc. In fact, we subdivide the whole scope of RuThes concepts to: • General Lexicon comprising concepts that can be met in various specific domains. In this, General Lexicon approximately corresponds to the Factotum domain in the Wordnet domain set (Gonzalez et al., 2012; Bentivogli et al., 2004), • and Socio-political Thesaurus containing thematically oriented lexemes and multiword expressions as well as domainspecific terms of the broad sociopolitical domain. After a concept has been introduced, an expert searches for all possible synonyms or derivative synonyms (that is derivates preserving the sense of an initial word), single words and phrases that can be associated with this concept. For example, a concept ДУШЕВНОЕ СТРАДАНИЕ (wound in the soul) has more than 20 text entries including such as: боль, боль в душе, в душе на- болело, душа болит, душа саднит, душевная пытка, душевная</context>

So these subtypes of partwhole relations in RuThes play the role of so-called WordNet domains, which were introduced to alleviate “tennis problem” – the lack of relations between synsets involved to the same situation or domain (Bentivogli et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2012) and several others. In such a broad scope RuThes part-whole relations are close to so called internal relations (parthood, constitution, quality inherence, and participation) as described in (Guarino, 2009). At the same time RuThes part-whole relations have a very important restriction: a concept-part should be related to its whole during normal existence of its instances: so called inseparable parts or mandatary wholes (Guizzardi, 2011). From this point of view, TREE concept is not described as part of FOREST concept, because trees can grow in many places, not only in</context>

Some of new wordnets enhance the diversity of lexical relations between words to describe mainly their derivational links (Azarowa, 2008; Derwojedowa et al., 2008; Maziarz et al., 2013; Bosch et al., 2008).

Every part-of-speech net has its own system of relations. Wordnets are often referred as linguistic or lexical ontologies (Magnini and Speranza, 2002; Veale and Hao, 2007), synsets of WordNet are often considered as lexicalized concepts. However, wordnets are mainly intended to describe lexical relations, what is quite different from the primary aim of ontologies to describe knowledge about the world, not about the language (Buitelaar et al., 2009; Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004). This difference reveals, for example, in the above mentioned division of wordnets to different part-of-speech subnets, because a part of speech cannot be a divisive feature in construction of ontologies. In this paper we will consider the structure and current state of Thesaurus of Russian language (linguistic ontology) RuThes, which for a long time has been developed within various NLP and information-retrieval projects (Loukachevitch and Dobrov, 2002), and now it is prepared to become available for public use.

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the comparison of units in ontologies, wordnets and information-retrieval thesauri. In Section 3 main components of RuThes are considered. In Section 4 we describe several applications and the evaluation of RuThes. At last in Section 5 we describe our licensing policy for RuThes distribution. 2 Units in Ontologies, Wordnets and Information-Retrieval Thesauri Ontologies are often considered as logical theories, which should be independent of natural language (Buitelaar et al., 2009; Smith, 2004). The general recommendations on the ontology concepts (classes) are usually described as follows (Noy and McGuinness, 2001; Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004): • one needs to distinguish the concept and its name, i.e. synonyms do not represent different classes, synonyms are just different names of the concepts • a concept should be distinctly different from its parent and from the concepts at the same level (sibling concepts).

National wordnets for many languages in the world were initiated. For developing a wordnet for a new language, several approaches can be applied. The first approach is based on automated or manual translation of Princeton WordNet (Balkova et al., 2008; Linden and Carlson, 2010). The second approach consists in creating of a wordnet from scratch using language-specific dictionaries and corpora (Climent et al., 1996; Azarowa, 2008; Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2010). This approach often implies the modification of the initial set of Princeton WordNet lexical relationships, introduction and justification of new relations, which usually requires additional time-consuming efforts (Maziarz et al., 2013; Pedersen et al., 2012). At least three attempts to create a Russian wordnet are known. RussNet (Azarowa, 2008) began to be developed from scratch and at this moment continues to be quite small (not more than 20 thousand synsets). Two other Russian wordnets were generated using automated translation (Gelfenbeyn et al.</context>

At last, an important additional factor, which can stimulate inclusion of a concept to the thesaurus, is the ambiguity of components of an unambiguous phrase, such as положение дел (state of affairs). 3.3 RuThes relations RuThes relations are of conceptual nature, not lexical ones. It is not a simple task to choose an appropriate set of relations for such a broad and diverse scope of concepts. RuThes has a small set of conceptual relations consisting of three main relations that are also applicable to a lot of various domains (Dobrov and Loukachevitch, 2006) and describe the most important links of a concept. The first relation is the traditional hyponymic (taxonomic) relation. To establish such relations we apply additional tests similar to ones used in ontology development. The tests are directed to avoid incorrect use of taxonomic relations and not to mix them up with other types of relations, because errors in relation types degrade logical inference Gangemi et al., 2001). We consider role-type relations as especially dangerous ones when a role concept (such as EMPLOYEE) is located as a parent concept for a type (as PERSON) (see discussion ab</context>

However, over time, the growing importance of the ontological research, as well as the similarity of the WordNet noun hierarchy with an ontology became apparent (Miller and Hristea, 2006). At the same time there exist a lot of deficiencies of WordNet descriptions from the ontological point of view (Guarino, 1998). Numerous examples of confusion between a concept and its names can be found in WordNet (Loukachevitch, 2009). Separate synsets are introduced for different ways of naming the same entities including the support of specific hierarchies for different parts of speech, for description </context>

The second conceptual relation used in RuThes is the part-whole relation. The partwhole relations can be applied in various domains, exist in diverse forms. Therefore in computer resources different approaches representing these relations can be taken (Winston et al., 1987; Guarino, 2009; Sowa, 2000). So, for example, the tradition to describe part-whole relations in wordnets differs considerably from the guidelines of informationretrieval thesauri construction (Z39.19, 2005; Fellbaum, 1998). In RuThes we use the generalized part-whole relation, which means that besides traditional types of part-whole relations (physical parts, process parts), relations between the following types of entities can be considered as part-whole relations: • an attribute and its bearer, • a role or a participant of a situation and the situation: investor - investing, player - playing (compare (Loebe, 2007)), • entities and situations in the encompassing sphere of activity: industrial plant - industry, tennis racket - tennis, tennis player - tennis.

RuThes has a small set of conceptual relations consisting of three main relations that are also applicable to a lot of various domains (Dobrov and Loukachevitch, 2006) and describe the most important links of a concept. The first relation is the traditional hyponymic (taxonomic) relation. To establish such relations we apply additional tests similar to ones used in ontology development. The tests are directed to avoid incorrect use of taxonomic relations and not to mix them up with other types of relations, because errors in relation types degrade logical inference Gangemi et al., 2001).

Thus, the inference mechanism can rely on the chain of part-whole relations so we use the transitivity of such restricted part-whole relations (Guizzardi, 2011). Let us see examples of the transitivity chain of part-whole relations: • (whole (ACCUSED PERSON, PUBLIC PROSECUTION), • whole (PUBLIC PROSECUTION , JUDICIAL TRIAL ), • whole (JUDICIAL TRIAL, JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS)) •  whole (ACCUSED PERSON, JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS) The next relation in RuThes ontology is unsymmetrical association asc1-asc2, which represents external dependence in ontological terms (Gangemi et al., 2001; Guarino, 2009). This relation is established between two concepts C1 and C2 when two requirements are fulfilled: • neither taxonomic nor part-whole relations can be established between C1 and C2 in RuThes linguistic ontology, • the following assertion is true: C2 exists means C1 exists (necessarily existent entities are excluded from consideration). These two conditions mean that concept C2 (dependent concept) externally depends on C1: asc1 (C2, C1) = asc2 (C1, C2) Examples of dependent concepts for AUTOMOBILE concepts are as follows: • asc2 (AUTOMOBILE, AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY): concept AUTOMOT</context>

At least three attempts to create a Russian wordnet are known. RussNet (Azarowa, 2008) began to be developed from scratch and at this moment continues to be quite small (not more than 20 thousand synsets). Two other Russian wordnets were generated using automated translation (Gelfenbeyn et al., 2003; Balkova et al., 2008). The former one is publicly available (http://wordnet.ru/) but represents the direct translation from Princeton Wordnet without any manual revision. The webpage of the latter one ceased to exist. The structure of Princeton WordNet (and other wordnets) is based on sets of partial synonyms – synsets, organized in hierarchical part-of-speechbased lexical nets according mainly to hyponymy-hypernymy relations. Every part-of-speech net has its own system of relations. Wordnets are often referred as linguistic or lexical ontologies (Magnini and Speranza, 2002; Veale and Hao, 2</context>

Besides, such a scope of concepts facilitates the application of RuThes in specialized subdomains of the broad socio-political domain. Examples of such concepts in RuThes include: EMERGENCY LOAN, TAX EXEMPTION, IMPORT TAX, DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATOR etc. In fact, we subdivide the whole scope of RuThes concepts to: • General Lexicon comprising concepts that can be met in various specific domains. In this, General Lexicon approximately corresponds to the Factotum domain in the Wordnet domain set (Gonzalez et al., 2012; Bentivogli et al., 2004), • and Socio-political Thesaurus containing thematically oriented lexemes and multiword expressions as well as domainspecific terms of the broad sociopolitical domain. After a concept has been introduced, an expert searches for all possible synonyms or derivative synonyms (that is derivates preserving the sense of an initial word), single words and phrases that can be associated with this concept. For example, a concept ДУШЕВНОЕ СТРАДАНИЕ (wound in the soul) has more than 20 text entries including such as: боль, боль в душе, в душе на- болело, душа болит, душа саднит</context>

So these subtypes of partwhole relations in RuThes play the role of so-called WordNet domains, which were introduced to alleviate “tennis problem” – the lack of relations between synsets involved to the same situation or domain (Bentivogli et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2012) and several others. In such a broad scope RuThes part-whole relations are close to so called internal relations (parthood, constitution, quality inherence, and participation) as described in (Guarino, 2009). At the same time RuThes part-whole relations have a very important restriction: a concept-part should be related to its whole during normal existence of its instances: so called inseparable parts or mandatary wholes (Guizzardi, 2011).

Wilks (Wilks, 2008) asserts that the symbols in representation languages are fundamentally based on the natural language. WordNet was created as a lexical rather than ontological resource (Fellbaum, 1998). However, over time, the growing importance of the ontological research, as well as the similarity of the WordNet noun hierarchy with an ontology became apparent (Miller and Hristea, 2006). At the same time there exist a lot of deficiencies of WordNet descriptions from the ontological point of view (Guarino, 1998). Numerous examples of confusion between a concept and its names can be found in WordNet (Loukachevitch, 2009). Separate synsets are introduced for different ways of naming the same entities including the support of specific hierarchies for different parts of speech, for description of old and new names of the same entities, specific word usage in different dialects of the language or text genres (moke - donkey, nose - nozzle) etc. This is due to the fact that the basic relation in WordNet is the synonymy, based on the principle of substitution of one for another in sentences (Fellbaum, 1998).</context>

National wordnets for many languages in the world were initiated. For developing a wordnet for a new language, several approaches can be applied. The first approach is based on automated or manual translation of Princeton WordNet (Balkova et al., 2008; Linden and Carlson, 2010). The second approach consists in creating of a wordnet from scratch using language-specific dictionaries and corpora (Climent et al., 1996; Azarowa, 2008; Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2010).

Two main questions are usually discussed here: what are the principles of inclusion of multiword expressions (especially compositional or semi-compositional ones) and what types of relations should connect a multiword expression and its components in the wordnet structure. In RuThes introduction of concepts based on multiword expressions is not restricted and even encouraged if (and only if) this concept adds some new information to knowledge described in RuThes. Such additional information may be subdivided into several types. A concept denotes an important entity. So in our Russia-oriented</context>

For a long time RuThes has been developed within various NLP and informationretrieval projects, and now it became available for public use. 1 Introduction Since its appearance Princeton WordNet has attracted a lot of attention of researchers and other specialists in natural language processing and information retrieval (Fellbaum, 1998). National wordnets for many languages in the world were initiated. For developing a wordnet for a new language, several approaches can be applied. The first approach is based on automated or manual translation of Princeton WordNet (Balkova et al., 2008; Linden and Carlson, 2010). The second approach consists in creating of a wordnet from scratch using language-specific dictionaries and corpora (Climent et al., 1996; Azarowa, 2008; Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2010). This approach often implies the modification of the initial set of Princeton WordNet lexical relationships, introduction and justification of new relations, which usually requires additional time-consuming efforts (Maziarz et al., 2013; Pedersen et al., 2012).

So, for example, the tradition to describe part-whole relations in wordnets differs considerably from the guidelines of informationretrieval thesauri construction (Z39.19, 2005; Fellbaum, 1998). In RuThes we use the generalized part-whole relation, which means that besides traditional types of part-whole relations (physical parts, process parts), relations between the following types of entities can be considered as part-whole relations: • an attribute and its bearer, • a role or a participant of a situation and the situation: investor - investing, player - playing (compare (Loebe, 2007)), • entities and situations in the encompassing sphere of activity: industrial plant - industry, tennis racket - tennis, tennis player - tennis. So these subtypes of partwhole relations in RuThes play the role of so-called WordNet domains, which were introduced to alleviate “tennis problem” – the lack of relations between synsets involved to the same situation or domain (Bentivogli et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2012) and several others. In such a broad scope RuThes part-whole relations are close to so called internal relations (parthood, constitution, quality inherence, and participation) as</context>

In this resource we attempted to create a linguistically motivated ontology (not a lexical net), based on the denotational part of lexical senses and conceptbased (not lexical) relations. At present, RuThes comprises more than 158 thousand unique words and expressions, which are structured into 53.5 thousand concepts. The structure of this paper is as follows.

If necessary, a concept may have a gloss, which is not a part of the concept name. Language expressions that may give rise to a separate concept in RuThes belong not only to the general vocabulary, but also can be terms of specific subject domains within the broad scope of social life (economy, law, international relations, politics, transport, banks, etc.), socalled socio-political domain (Loukachevitch and Dobrov, 2004). This is due to the fact that many professional concepts, terms, and slang of these domains penetrate easily into the general language, and can be widely discussed in mass media. Besides, such a scope of concepts facilitates the application of RuThes in specialized subdomains of the broad socio-political domain. Examples of such concepts in RuThes include: EMERGENCY LOAN, TAX EXEMPTION, IMPORT TAX, DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATOR etc. In fact, we subdivide the whole scope of RuThes concepts to: • General Lexicon comprising concepts that can be met in various specific domains.

A concept is considered as a unit of a thought, regardless of the terms that express them. Creating RuThes as an ontology with conceptbased (not lexical) relations, we assumed that the concept-oriented approach to the lexical knowledge representation gives the possibility of better matching between languages (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002), more natural connection with domain terminologies, which are inherently concept-based (Z39.19, 2005); and more reliable logical inference based on current ontological research (Masolo et al., 2003; Guarino, 2009; Guizzardi, 2011). 3 RuThes linguistic ontology RuThes Thesaurus of Russian language can be called a linguistic ontology for natural language processing, i.e. an ontology, where the majority of concepts are introduced on the basis of actual language expressions. In construction of RuThes we combined three different methodologies: • methods of construction of informationretrieval thesauri (concept-based units, a small set of relation types, rules of multiword expression inclusion) • development of wordnets for various languages (language-motivated units, detailed sets of synonym</context>

These two conditions mean that concept C2 (dependent concept) externally depends on C1: asc1 (C2, C1) = asc2 (C1, C2) Examples of dependent concepts for AUTOMOBILE concepts are as follows: • asc2 (AUTOMOBILE, AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY): concept AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY exists only if concept AUTOMOBILE exists; • asc2 (FOREST, TREE) concept FOREST exists only if concept TREE exists. Relations of ontological dependence are applicable in various domains, therefore they are usually used in top-level ontologies (Sowa, 2000; Masolo et al., 2003; Grenon, 2003). Besides in (Kumar and Smith, 2004) authors discuss the importance of such a relation for the biology domain: cell movement cannot exist without cells. It is the first time when such relations are basic relations for a linguistic ontology. An additional advantage of using this relation in linguistic ontologies consists in its usefulness for description of links between a concept based on the sense of a compositional multiword expression and concepts corresponding to the components of this multiword expression.

Section 2 is devoted to the comparison of units in ontologies, wordnets and information-retrieval thesauri. In Section 3 main components of RuThes are considered. In Section 4 we describe several applications and the evaluation of RuThes. At last in Section 5 we describe our licensing policy for RuThes distribution. 2 Units in Ontologies, Wordnets and Information-Retrieval Thesauri Ontologies are often considered as logical theories, which should be independent of natural language (Buitelaar et al., 2009; Smith, 2004). The general recommendations on the ontology concepts (classes) are usually described as follows (Noy and McGuinness, 2001; Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004): • one needs to distinguish the concept and its name, i.e. synonyms do not represent different classes, synonyms are just different names of the concepts • a concept should be distinctly different from its parent and from the concepts at the same level (sibling concepts). However, to use ontologies in natural language processing, concepts of ontologies should be associated with language expressions and structures. In (Maedche and Zacharias, 20</context>

These two conditions mean that concept C2 (dependent concept) externally depends on C1: asc1 (C2, C1) = asc2 (C1, C2) Examples of dependent concepts for AUTOMOBILE concepts are as follows: • asc2 (AUTOMOBILE, AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY): concept AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY exists only if concept AUTOMOBILE exists; • asc2 (FOREST, TREE) concept FOREST exists only if concept TREE exists. Relations of ontological dependence are applicable in various domains, therefore they are usually used in top-level ontologies (Sowa, 2000; Masolo et al., 2003; Grenon, 2003). Besides in (Kumar and Smith, 2004) authors discuss the importance of such a relation for the biology domain: cell movement cannot exist without cells. It is the first time when such relations are basic relations for a linguistic ontology. An additional advantage of using this relation in linguistic ontologies consists in its usefulness for description of links between a concept based on the sense of a compositional multiword expression and concepts corresponding to the components of this multiword expression.

Therefore establishing the taxonomic relationship we also check the fulfillment of the following principle: every instance of a child concept should be at the same time the instance of a parent concept (not every person is an employee). The second conceptual relation used in RuThes is the part-whole relation. The partwhole relations can be applied in various domains, exist in diverse forms. Therefore in computer resources different approaches representing these relations can be taken (Winston et al., 1987; Guarino, 2009; Sowa, 2000). So, for example, the tradition to describe part-whole relations in wordnets differs considerably from the guidelines of informationretrieval thesauri construction (Z39.19, 2005; Fellbaum, 1998). In RuThes we use the generalized part-whole relation, which means that besides traditional types of part-whole relations (physical parts, process parts), relations between the following types of entities can be considered as part-whole relations: • an attribute and its bearer, • a role or a participant of a situation and the situation: investor - investing, player - playing (compare (Loebe, 2007)), •</context>

The former one is publicly available (http://wordnet.ru/) but represents the direct translation from Princeton Wordnet without any manual revision. The webpage of the latter one ceased to exist. The structure of Princeton WordNet (and other wordnets) is based on sets of partial synonyms – synsets, organized in hierarchical part-of-speechbased lexical nets according mainly to hyponymy-hypernymy relations. Every part-of-speech net has its own system of relations. Wordnets are often referred as linguistic or lexical ontologies (Magnini and Speranza, 2002; Veale and Hao, 2007), synsets of WordNet are often considered as lexicalized concepts. However, wordnets are mainly intended to describe lexical relations, what is quite different from the primary aim of ontologies to describe knowledge about the world, not about the language (Buitelaar et al., 2009; Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004). This difference reveals, for example, in the above mentioned division of wordnets to different part-of-speech subnets, because a part of speech cannot be a divisive feature in construction of ontologies.

In (Maedche and Zacharias, 2002; Buitelaar et al., 2006; Buitelaar et al., 2009) special models for linking natural language expressions and ontological entities are proposed. From another point of view, an ontology cannot be fully independent of natural language. Ch. Brewster and colleagues (Brewster et al., 2005) stress that people manipulate concepts through words. In all known ontologies the words are used to represent concepts. Therefore, phenomena that are not verbalized, cannot be modeled. Y. Wilks (Wilks, 2008) asserts that the symbols in representation languages are fundamentally based on the natural language. WordNet was created as a lexical rather than ontological resource (Fellbaum, 1998). However, over time, the growing importance of the ontological research, as well as the similarity of the WordNet noun hierarchy with an ontology became apparent (Miller and Hristea, 2006). At the same time there exist a lot of deficiencies of WordNet descriptions from the ontological point of view (Guarino, 1998). Numerous examples of confusion between a concept and its names can be found in WordNet (Loukachev</context>

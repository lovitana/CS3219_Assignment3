In this paper I apply a novel method of network
text analysis to a sample of 150 original
screenplays. That sample is divided evenly be-
tween unproduced, original screenplays (n =
75) and those that were nominated for Best
Original Screenplay by either the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences or by major
film critics associations (n = 75). As predicted,
I find that the text networks derived from un-
produced screenplays are significantly less
complex, i.e. they contain fewer concepts
(nodes) and statements (links). Unexpectedly, I
find that those same networks are more cohe-
sive, i.e. they exhibit higher density and core-
ness.

Diesner &amp; Carley (2005, p. 83) employ the term
network text analysis (NTA) to describe a wide
variety of “computer supported solutions” that
enable analysts to “extract networks of concepts”
from texts and to discern the “meaning” repre-
sented or encoded therein. The key underlying
assumption of such methods or solutions, they
assert, is that the “language and knowledge” em-
bodied in a text may be “modeled” as a network
“of words and the relations between them ” (ibid,
emphasis added). A second important assump-
tion is that the position of concepts within a text
network provides insight into the meaning or
prominent themes of the text as a whole.
Broadly considered, creating networks from
texts has two basic steps: (1) the assignment of
words and phrases to conceptual categories and
(2) the assignment of links to pairs of those cate-
gories. Approaches to NTA differ with regard to
how these steps are performed, as well as to the
level of automation or computer support, the lin-
guistic unit of analysis (e.g. noun or verbs), and
the degree and basis of concept generalization.
In the social sciences, several studies in the last
two decades have linked the structural properties
of text networks to measures of individual,
group/team, and organizational performance
(Nadkarni &amp; Narayaran, 2005). The quantitative
empirical literature on this topic can be divided
into two groups or streams—educational psy-
chology (EP) and managerial and organizational
cognition (MOC). The former typically links
structural properties of text networks abstracted
from documents like exams and case analyses to
academic performance and learning outcomes.
The latter abstracts text networks from reports
generated by firm’s managers, e.g. letters to
shareholders and 10-K filings, and links those
properties directly or indirectly to firm perfor-
mance.
Across both streams, the structural properties
of networks that have been examined fall into
three broad categories—measures of complexity
or size, measures of cohesion or connectedness,
and measures of centrality or concentration. An-
other point of consensus concerns the underlying
relationships from which the text networks are
constructed. Most of the quantitative and empiri-
cal studies have relied upon logical relationships
among concepts in documents for that purpose.
These relationships include, but are not limited
to, dependence, chronology, similarity, function-
ality, causality, and composition (Popping, 2003,
pp. 94-5). The second and less commonly used
type of relationship involves the co-occurrence
of concepts within a user-defined window (e.g.
Carley, 1997). Notably, grammatical and lexical
relationships have received no attention in the
empirical literature. However, Hunter (in press)
recently described a “novel”, semi-automated
method of network text analysis whereby multi-
morphemic compounds (e.g. abbreviations, acro-
nyms, blend words, clipped words, and com-
pound words) in a text are linked via shared ety-
mological roots. He applied that method to sam-
ple of seven recent winners of the Academy
Award for Best Original Screenplay and found
that the most centrally-positioned words in five
of the seven networks corresponded very closely
to the themes contained in the films’ synopses

toes.
This study represents the first application of
Hunter’s method to a sample of screenplays of
sufficient size to permit multivariate statistical
analysis. The specific aim of the study is to ex-
amine the relationship between text networks’
properties and performance outcomes. To that
end, I herein develop and test two falsifiable hy-
potheses concerning that relationship on a sam-
ple of 150 contemporary screenplays—half win-
ners and nominees of major awards and the other
half unproduced screenplays obtained from two
online screenplay portals. Consistent with the
prior literature I find that the more favorably rat-
ed screenplays—i.e. the award winners and nom-
inees—have significantly larger text networks
than the unproduced ones. Unexpectedly, I find
that text networks of these screenplays exhibit
significantly lower cohesiveness, i.e. lower den-
sity and coreness.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows. In section 2, Theory &amp; Hypotheses, I
summarize the relevant social science literature
on text network properties and performance and
formulate two hypotheses concerning that rela-
tionship. In the third section, Data &amp; Methods, I
describe the data set and the method for con-
structing the text networks for each screenplay in
the sample. In the fourth section, Results &amp; Dis-
cussion, I report the level of statistical support
found for each hypothesis and discuss the impli-
cation of the results for current and future re-
search in this area.

Figure 1, below, is adapted from Carley (1997)
and it is typical of many network representations
of texts. The network itself was constructed from
the following two sentences: “Organizations use
information systems to handle data. Information
is processed by organizations who are interested
in locating behavioral trends.”
Several things about the network are note-
worthy. First, observe that there are seven con-
cepts depicted as nodes in the network, each of
which appears only once. They are “organiza-
tions”, “information systems”, “process”, “in-
formation”, “interested”, “locating”, and
“trends.” Second, see that there are also seven
statements, i.e. pairs of concepts: (1) “infor-
mation systems” and “process” (2) “information
systems” and “organizations” (3) “process” and
‘information” (4) “process” and “organizations”
(5) “interested” and “organizations” (6) “inter-
ested” and “locating” and (7) “locating” and
“trends.” Third, note that the map itself is com-
prised of the network formed by all seven state-
ments. Typically, the analyst must read some or
all of the statements in a map in order to extract
the meaning of the text as a whole. In this regard,
it is then notable that the seven concepts are im-
plicated in varying numbers of statements. Spe-
cifically, the concepts labeled “organization” and
“process” are found in three statements while all
other concepts are found in either two or one.
In the social science literature, the most
widely-investigated structural property of text
networks are the number of concepts and the
number of links between pairs of concepts. For
example, Calori, Johnson &amp; Sarnin (1994) stud-
ied the moderating effects of “environmental
complexity”, i.e. the scope of the organization as
measured by the number of distinct businesses
and geographic segments, on the relationship
between the “cognitive complexity of the chief
executive” and firm performance. One of their
measures of cognitive complexity was the num-
ber of concepts abstracted from interviews with
each CEO about their firm’s environment. They
hypothesized that cognitive maps of CEOs of
more diverse firms had more “comprehensive”,
i.e. larger, cognitive maps than CEOs of more
focused firms. This hypothesis was NOT sup-
ported. However, they also hypothesized that
cognitive maps of CEOs in firms with greater
international geographic scope would contain
more concepts. This hypothesis was supported.
Nadkarni (2003, p. 336) employed the term
“comprehensiveness” to refer to the “number of
concepts in a mental model.” In a study of stu-
dents exposed to three different instructional
methods, he hypothesized and found (1) signifi-
cant differences in the comprehensiveness of the

mental models of students of student across
methods and (2) greater comprehensiveness in
said models among students with low-learning
maturity who were exposed to a “hybrid” method
of instruction, i.e. a mix of lecture-discussion and
experiential learning.
Nadkarni &amp; Narayaran (2005) examined the
relationship of two measures of “complexity”—
the number of concepts and the number of state-
ments—on learning outcomes. Specifically, they
reported a positive relationship between the
number of concepts and links found in “text-
based causal maps” abstracted from students’
written case analyses and their course grades.
Carley (1997) compared the mental models
of eight project teams, each with 4-6 members,
enrolled in an information systems project course
at a private university. Each team was required to
“analyze a client’s need and then design and
build an information system to meet that need
within one semester.” Five of these teams were
eventually deemed successful and three were not.
At three points during the semester, each team
was required to provide responses to two open-
ended questions—“What is an information sys-
tem?” and “What leads to information system
success or failure?” Their answers were coded
and used as data. On average, the “cognitive
maps” of the members of successful groups had
significantly more concepts and more statements
(links) compared to maps by members of non-
successful groups. In light of the aforementioned
studies, the first hypothesis (H1) is that network
complexity, measured as the number of concepts
and/or links, is positively related to performance.
As a class, measures of network cohesion in-
dicate the degree to which the nodes in a network
are connected to one another. Common measures
of cohesion include, but are not limited to, densi-
ty, fragmentation, connectedness, average path
distance, and diameter (Borgatti, Everett, and
Freeman, 2002). But while many such measures
exist, very few empirical studies have directly
examined the linkage between the cohesion in
text networks and measures of performance. One
such study is Nadkarni &amp; Narayaran’s (2005)
aforementioned analysis of text-based causal
maps abstracted from business case studies. They
hypothesized and found network density—
measured as the ratio of the number of links to
the number of possible links—to be positively
related to three measures of academic perfor-
mance—test grades, case analysis grades, and
class participation scores.
A second such study is Bodin’s (2012) inves-
tigation of “university physics student’s epistem-
ic framing when solving and visualizing a phys-
ics problem using a particle-spring model sys-
tem” (p. 1). In that study, concept networks were
developed from two sets of interview transcripts
where students described the task and (physics)
problem they were about to solve, as well as their
planned strategies for solving the problem. An
analysis of networks drawn prior to and right
after completion of the assignment revealed a
24% increase in the number of concepts, a 71%
increase in the number of links, and 12% in-
crease in network density. While all of these
quantities were in the predicted direction, no sta-
tistical significance was indicated. Still, the exist-
ing empirical evidence suggests network density
is positively related to performance. And be-
cause various network cohesion measures are
closely related conceptually—and can be strong-
ly correlated, as well (Borgatti, Everett,
&amp;Johnson, 2014)—then it is more appropriate to
phrase the second hypothesis (H2) in more gen-
eral terms, i.e. that network cohesion is positive-
ly related to performance.

As indicated in the preceding section, the empiri-
cal literature has been focused on two kinds of
texts—student assignments and firm reporting—
and two kinds of performance—grades and fi-
nancial performance. But there is nothing inher-
ent in these network text analytic methods that
limits investigation to the texts mentioned above.
Nor has any of the research reviewed indicated
otherwise. That said, a number of specific ration-
ales motivated the selection of screenplays, in
general, and original screenplays in particular.
First, screenplays are highly structured texts,
both logically and temporally, with the three-act
structure in screenwriting being a prime example
(Field, 1998). Second, there exists a large, wide-
ly-read, and broadly-disseminated body of
knowledge concerning the theory and best prac-
tice of screenwriting (e.g. Snyder, 2005; McKee,
2010; Field, 2007). Third, screenplays are care-
fully evaluated by many interested parties on
numerous dimensions, not the least of which are
commercial success and artistic merit (Simonton,
2005; Pardoe &amp; Simonton 2008). Finally, the
performance of their authors is discrete and quite
unambiguous: more than 15,000 screenplays are
registered in the US each year with the Writer’s
Guild of America but fewer than 700 get “green-

lighted” and are subsequently produced (Eliash-
berg, Elberse, &amp; Enders, 2006). Further, those
screenplays that do get “green-lighted” either
garner awards or critical acclaim or they do not
(Simonton, 2004, 2005).
Somewhat surprisingly, textual analyses of
screenplays are relatively rare when compared to
analyses of other literary forms such as novels,
plays, and poetry. The only studies of which I am
aware that links textual variables of screenplays
to performance are those by Elishaberg, Hui, &amp;
Zhang (2007, 2014) whose kernel-based ap-
proach to the study of 300 movies released be-
tween 1995 and 2010 significantly predicted Re-
turn on investment, i.e. box office revenues as a
percentage of budget. The present study repre-
sents the first attempt to link textual measures of
screenplays to a non-financial-related perfor-
mance measure.
Screenplays contained in the sample were ob-
tained from a variety of sources. The oldest and
most prestigious awards in American cinema are
the Academy Awards, aka the “Oscars” (Os-
borne, 1989) and several studies have been done
explaining their artistic and commercial im-
portance (e.g., Krauss, Nan, Simon, et al, 2008;
Lee, 2009; Simonton, 2004). Academy Award
nominated and winning screenplays are routinely
studied by aspiring screenwriters (New York
Film Academy, 2014) and widely available
online either for free (Simply Scripts, 2014) or
purchase (Script Fly, 2014). Winners and nomi-
nees of other awards are often available online,
as are the screenplays of films which garner no
particular artistic acclaim. There are, as well,
numerous online forums, websites, and blogs
devoted to their discussion and analysis. Moreo-
ver, the screenplays for award-nominated, award-
winning, and critically-acclaimed films are usu-
ally made available by their producers or studios
during the award season, but not all of them re-
main so. In this study, the “produced” or high-
performing sample of screenplays are of two
kinds. The first consists of nominees and winners
of the Academy Award for Best Original Screen-
play. Five screenplays are nominated each year
making for a potential sample of 40 screenplays.
However, two screenplays by Woody Allen—
Blue Jasmine and Midnight in Paris—were not
available. Another five nominees whose films
were all or partially in foreign-languages were
also excluded—Pan’s Labyrinth (Spanish),
Amour (French), A Separation (Farsi), Babel
(Arabic, English, Spanish, and Japanese), and
Letters from Iwo Jima (Japanese). Thus there
were 32 remaining Academy Award nominated
screenplays for films released in the years 2006-
2013.
Another fifty-two (52) screenplays were nom-
inated in the years 2006-13 for Best Original
Screenplay by the 32 regional members of the
American Film Critics Association, e.g. the New
York, Washington D.C., and San Francisco Film
Critics Circles. Several of these were not com-
mercially or otherwise available. These include
Upstream Color, The Tree of Life, Frances Ha,
World’s End, Sound of My Voice, United 93, and
Stranger than Fiction. Toy Story 3 was excluded
because, while an original screenplay, it was part
of a film franchise. The South African film Black
Book was excluded, as well, because it was not in
English. The remaining 43 screenplays were ob-
tained. Thus there was a total of 75 screenplays
contained in the produced and thus “high-
performing” category.
Another 75 unproduced screenplays were
randomly selected from two online screenplay
databases—Simply Scripts and Trigger Street
Labs. The former hosts pages within its site titled
“Unproduced Scripts” where screenwriters are
invited to upload their screenplays. Trigger Street
Labs is a portal maintained by actor Kevin Spac-
ey’s Trigger Street Productions. It allows writers
to post original short stories, short films, and
screenplays. Thirty-eight (38) screenplays posted
between January 1, 2006 and December 31st,
2013 and between 100 and 140 pages were ran-
domly selected from both sites. One was then
selected at random and eliminated, making the
total number of unproduced screenplays seventy-
five (75).
Diesner (2012) outlines four steps for the cre-
ation of a text network—(1) Selection (2) Ab-
straction (3) Relation and (4) Extraction. The
first step involves identification of those words
that will be subjected to subsequent analysis and
the elimination of those that will not. Following
Hunter (in press), this stage involved retention of
all multi-morphemic compounds comprised of
two or more free (unbound) morphemes. These
included, but were not limited to, closed and hy-
phenated compound words, clipped words, blend
words or portmanteau, and all acronyms, anacro-
nyms, abbreviations, and initialisms.
Also included were selected instances of con-
version, certain prefixes and suffixes, plus se-
lected multi-word compounds and infixes, Ex-
amples are shown in Table 1 below. And though
it may seem otherwise, this is no random group-
ing. Rather, they comprise a well-defined, inter-

related set that is extensively-studied in the field
of morphology. Specifically, they all belong to
the branch of morphology known as word-
formation, the study of creation of new or “nov-
el” words principally through changes in their
form (Wisniewski, 2007).
Because no existing text mining software se-
lects these groups words from a text, the process
for identifying them was only semi-automated
with the help of a software program called Au-
tomap 3.0.10 (Carley, 2001-2013).

The process was as follows. First the screen-
play was converted to a text file and uploaded to
Automap. After removing single letters, extra
spaces, and spurious characters, two routines
were run within Automap—Identify Possible Ac-
ronyms and Concept List. The former routine
identified and extracted all words that were capi-
talized. Several of these turned out to acronyms
or abbreviations. The latter routine used was
Concept List (Per Text) which generated a list of
all unique words for each text. Excluded from
consideration were all proper nouns (Green
Zone, Hollywood), place and organization names
(South Pole, Scotland Yard, Burger King), prod-
uct names (Land Rover), holidays (New Year’s
Eve, Christmas Eve), as well as any other word
or phrase connoting a specific person, place, or
thing through capitalization. Also eliminated
were all instances of screenplay and film jargon,
e.g. ECU (extreme close-up), off-screen, VO
(voice-over) and POV (point of view), as well as
multi-word exclamations and interjections such
as good night, goodbye, OMG (oh my God), etc.
The second of the four steps of constructing a
text network involves abstraction of the selected
multi-morphemic compounds to higher-order
concepts. In this study, each of the free (un-
bound) morphemes in each compound was as-
signed to its etymological root, typically the In-
do-European, Latin, or Greek (Watkins, 2011).
By definition, from every etymological root
descends or originates at least one word, other-
wise it is not a root. That relationship is genitive,
i.e. a relational case typically expressing source,
possession, or partition. It is hierarchical and di-
rected—from the root (parent) to word (descend-
ent). Thus, in the third step of network construc-
tion, two or more etymological roots were linked
or related when words (free morphemes) de-
scending from them co-occurred within the same
word, as the following examples demonstrates.
Consider a text that contains the following
nine words: the closed compound words man-
power, sunlight, southwestern, and gentlemen;
the open compounds vesper rose, and native
tongue; the hyphenated compound solar-
powered self-possessed; and the proper noun
Secretary General. As shown in Table 2, below,
these words are all multi-morphemic compounds,
each element of which descends from two differ-
ent etymological roots.

morphemic Compounds Contained in Table 1
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999719185185185">
Recall that a statement in NTA is comprised
of two concepts and the relationship that links
them. In Figure 2, above, each of these words
appears on the link between the two etymological
roots—the concepts—that co-occur within the
word. Put another way, the relationship is the co-
occurrence of two different etymological roots in
the same multi-morphemic compound or multi-
word expression—co-occurrence in what is es-
sentially a window of one word. For example,
the etymological roots gene- (to give birth; be-
get) and man-1 (man) are linked by their co-
occurrence in the compound word gentleman.
Taken together, that word and those two roots
comprise a statement. And as shown below, it is
possible to construct an entire map or network
from these interconnected statements. Specifical-
ly, that network is comprised of eight concepts—
namely, the Indo-European roots dnghu-, gene-,
man1, s(w)e-, poti-, saewel-, leuk, wrod- and
wes-pero—and the nine multi-morphemic com-
pounds—native tongue, gentleman, Secretary
General, self-possessed, manpower, solar power,
sunlight, vesper rose, and southwestern.
A similar approach was used to constructing
text networks for each of the 150 screenplays in
the sample. Specifically, after matching all of the
above classes of multi-morphemic compounds to
their corresponding etymological roots, all pairs
of roots for each screenplay were converted into
a symmetrical matrix which was then uploaded
into version 6.487 of the UCINet software pro-
gram (Borgatti, Everett, and Freeman, 2002).
Text networks were then generated using version
2.118 of the NetDraw software program embed-
ded in UCINet. Figure 3, below, is depicted main
component of the text network for the screenplay
of Zero Dark Thirty. which was nominated for
Best Original Screenplay in 2012. The main
component is the largest group of mutually-
reachable nodes in a network. Note that the node
labels are etymological roots, typically Indo-
European (Watkins, 2011) In the case of words
with non-Indo-European roots, the base form of
the component of the multi-morphemic com-
pound is used.
The fourth stage involves the extraction of
meaning from the completed text network. But
since the investigation of meaning is not a part of
this analysis, it is excluded from further consid-
eration. See Hunter (in press) for a detailed dis-
cussion and examples. Table 3, below, summa-
rizes some basic statistics and network metrics
for the 150 screenplays in the sample.

Recall that the first hypothesis (H1) proposed
that network complexity was positively related to
performance. Following the prior literature,
complexity was measured as both the number of
concepts in a network, i.e. the number of unique
etymological roots, and as the number of state-
ments, i.e. the number of pairs of concepts.. Be-
cause these values were very highly correlated (
 = 0.98, p &lt; 0.0001) their respective z-scores
were averaged to obtain a single value for com-
plexity. Table 4a, below, presents the results of a
multinomial regression of screenplay genre,
word count, and network complexity on screen-
play type. The positive coefficients on complexi-
ty indicate that, as predicted, text networks of
screenplays of winners and nominees of Acade-
my Awards (= 0.574, p &lt; 0.0001) and critics’
awards ( = 0.359, p &lt; 0.01) have significantly
greater complexity than text networks of unpro-
duced screenplays. The Nagelkerke, Cox &amp;
Snell, and McFadden pseudo-R2 values were
30.6%, 26.7%, and 15.0%, respectively. Thus,
H1 is strongly supported.

The second hypothesis (H2) predicted that
network cohesion would be positively related to
performance. In this study cohesion was meas-
ured by density and coreness (the degree to
which the network is characterized by a tightly
interconnected core and a much less tightly con-
nected periphery).
Because these two values were highly corre-
lated ( = 0.55, p &lt; 0.001), the z-scores for each
measure were averaged to obtain a single value
for cohesion. Table 4b presents the results of a
multinomial regression of screenplay genre,
word count, and network cohesion on screenplay
type. The negative and significant value of the
coefficients indicates that cohesion is negatively
associated with performance, the exact opposite
of what was predicted.
Specifically, cohesion of text networks derived
from screenplays in the Academy ( = -0.870, p
&lt; 0.0001) and critics award ( = -0.413, p &lt;
0.001) categories is significantly lower than that
for unproduced screenplays. That means they
typically have both lower density and/or a less
core-periphery type structure. The Nagelkerke,
Cox &amp; Snell, and McFadden pseudo-R2 values
were 36.8%, 32.1%, and 18.7%, respectively.
Taken together, the results suggest that text
networks derived from original screenplays se-
lected by the Academy and by film critics have
very different structural properties than text net-
works derived from unproduced screenplays. In
short, the former are larger, yet held together by
proportionately fewer linkages.

The reason for this disparity may well have to
do with the size of the networks under examina-
tion. In both the educational psychology and the
managerial and organizational cognition litera-
tures, the typical size of the networks is about 1/6
that of those examined here. Recall that as a net-
work grows, the number of possible connections
grows exponentially. As such, density becomes
smaller at an exponential rate. In this study, the
text networks derived from both sets of screen-
plays had concept to statement ratios of close to
unity. Thus, given that the award winners and
nominees had much larger text networks, it fol-
lows logically that those networks were also
much less dense.

In closing, it is important to recognize three
important limitations of the current study. Firstly,
the sample size is relatively small—only half the
size of that found in the only other study of
screenplays that includes textual analysis, i.e.
Eliashberg, Hui, &amp; Zhang (2014). The sample is
also not ideally constructed. Rather than compar-
ing award winners to unproduced screenplays, a
better sample would include entries from a
screenplay competition and the study design
would attempt to select finalists and winners
from that sample. Winners of top competitions
are very frequently optioned and eventually pro-
duced. Alternatively, another approach would be
to increase sample size and to include screen-
plays which garnered no critical or artistic
awards. Even though many such screenplays can
be located, finding a representative sample of
them is difficult because they are not uniformly
available. Still, if that hurdle can be overcome,
the sample could be used to study box-office
revenues, potentially improving upon the current
understanding of screenplays’ contribution to a
film’s financial success.
A third limitation of this study concerns the
labor-intensive nature of the coding. At present,
the process outlined above is only semi-
automated. Unless and until advanced computa-
tional methods of text analysis can be developed
and applied, sample sizes will remain small and
the coding prone to human error.
Finally, recall that the fourth stage of network
text analysis involves the extraction of meaning
from the network itself. Typically, this involves a
study of the most central nodes (concepts), as
well as the statements (links) associated with
them. For example, in the case of Zero Dark
Thirty the most influential node or concept, as
measured by network constraint, is the Indo-
European root wegh- which means “way” and
from which descends such words as way and
weight. One of the multi-morphemic compounds
associated with that concept in the Figure 3,
above, is “hijacker” which is a clipped word, the
full form being “highwayjacker” (Online Etymo-
logical Dictionary, 2014). Other multi-
morphemic compounds associated with highly
influential nodes in the network include SEAL,
CIA, WMD, QRF (Quick Reaction Force), and
NSA. As noted by Hunter (in press), other
award-winning and critically-acclaimed screen-
plays exhibit the same pattern, i.e. words associ-
ated with influential nodes are also closely relat-
ed to key themes of the story. Anecdotally, the
unproduced screenplays give less evidence of
this tendency. Future research might examine
whether this difference is systematic. To that
end, all data involved in this study—the text of
all 150 screenplays and all of the network cod-
ing—will be made freely available to interested
and qualified researchers upon request.

That sample is divided evenly between unproduced, original screenplays (n = 75) and those that were nominated for Best Original Screenplay by either the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences or by major film critics associations (n = 75). As predicted, I find that the text networks derived from unproduced screenplays are significantly less complex, i.e. they contain fewer concepts (nodes) and statements (links).

In light of the aforementioned studies, the first hypothesis (H1) is that network complexity, measured as the number of concepts and/or links, is positively related to performance. As a class, measures of network cohesion indicate the degree to which the nodes in a network are connected to one another. Common measures of cohesion include, but are not limited to, density, fragmentation, connectedness, average path distance, and diameter (Borgatti, Everett, and Freeman, 2002). But while many such measures exist, very few empirical studies have directly examined the linkage between the cohesion in text networks and measures of performance. One such study is Nadkarni &amp; Narayaran’s (2005) aforementioned analysis of text-based causal maps abstracted from business case studies. They hypothesized and found network density— measured as the ratio of the number of links to the number of possible links—to be positively related to three measures of academic performance—test grades, case analysis grades, and class participation scores.

A similar approach was used to constructing text networks for each of the 150 screenplays in the sample. Specifically, after matching all of the above classes of multi-morphemic compounds to their corresponding etymological roots, all pairs of roots for each screenplay were converted into a symmetrical matrix which was then uploaded into version 6.487 of the UCINet software program (Borgatti, Everett, and Freeman, 2002). Text networks were then generated using version 2.118 of the NetDraw software program embedded in UCINet.

Another point of consensus concerns the underlying relationships from which the text networks are constructed. Most of the quantitative and empirical studies have relied upon logical relationships among concepts in documents for that purpose. These relationships include, but are not limited to, dependence, chronology, similarity, functionality, causality, and composition (Popping, 2003, pp. 94-5). The second and less commonly used type of relationship involves the co-occurrence of concepts within a user-defined window (e.g. Carley, 1997). Notably, grammatical and lexical relationships have received no attention in the empirical literature. However, Hunter (in press) recently described a “novel”, semi-automated method of network text analysis whereby multimorphemic compounds (e.g. abbreviations, acronyms, blend words, clipped words, and compound words) in a text are linked via shared etymological roots. He applied that method to sample of seven recent winners of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and found that the most centrally-positioned words in five of the seven networks corresponded very closely to the themes</context>

In section 2, Theory &amp; Hypotheses, I summarize the relevant social science literature on text network properties and performance and formulate two hypotheses concerning that relationship. In the third section, Data &amp; Methods, I describe the data set and the method for constructing the text networks for each screenplay in the sample. In the fourth section, Results &amp; Discussion, I report the level of statistical support found for each hypothesis and discuss the implication of the results for current and future research in this area. 2 Theory &amp; Hypotheses Figure 1, below, is adapted from Carley (1997) and it is typical of many network representations of texts. The network itself was constructed from the following two sentences: “Organizations use information systems to handle data. Information is processed by organizations who are interested in locating behavioral trends.” Several things about the network are noteworthy. First, observe that there are seven concepts depicted as nodes in the network, each of which appears only once. They are “organizations”, “information systems”, “process”, “information”, “interested”, “locating”, and “trends.” Second, see that there are also seven statemen</context>

However, they also hypothesized that cognitive maps of CEOs in firms with greater international geographic scope would contain more concepts. This hypothesis was supported. Nadkarni (2003, p. 336) employed the term “comprehensiveness” to refer to the “number of concepts in a mental model.” In a study of students exposed to three different instructional methods, he hypothesized and found (1) significant differences in the comprehensiveness of the Figure1: A Simple Text Network (adapted from Carley, 1997) 69 mental models of students of student across methods and (2) greater comprehensiveness in said models among students with low-learning maturity who were exposed to a “hybrid” method of instruction, i.e. a mix of lecture-discussion and experiential learning. Nadkarni &amp; Narayaran (2005) examined the relationship of two measures of “complexity”— the number of concepts and the number of statements—on learning outcomes. Specifically, they reported a positive relationship between the number of concepts and links found in “textbased causal maps” abstracted from students’ written case analyses and </context>

Trigger Street Labs is a portal maintained by actor Kevin Spacey’s Trigger Street Productions. It allows writers to post original short stories, short films, and screenplays. Thirty-eight (38) screenplays posted between January 1, 2006 and December 31st, 2013 and between 100 and 140 pages were randomly selected from both sites. One was then selected at random and eliminated, making the total number of unproduced screenplays seventyfive (75).

Nor has any of the research reviewed indicated otherwise. That said, a number of specific rationales motivated the selection of screenplays, in general, and original screenplays in particular. First, screenplays are highly structured texts, both logically and temporally, with the three-act structure in screenwriting being a prime example (Field, 1998). Second, there exists a large, widely-read, and broadly-disseminated body of knowledge concerning the theory and best practice of screenwriting (e.g. Snyder, 2005; McKee, 2010; Field, 2007). Third, screenplays are carefully evaluated by many interested parties on numerous dimensions, not the least of which are commercial success and artistic merit (Simonton, 2005; Pardoe &amp; Simonton 2008). Finally, the performance of their authors is discrete and quite unambiguous: more than 15,000 screenplays are registered in the US each year with the Writer’s Guild of America but fewer than 700 get “green70 lighted” and are subsequently produced (Eliashberg, Elberse, &amp; Enders, 2006). Further, those screenplays that do get “green-lighted” either garner awards or critical acclaim or they do not </context>

One of their measures of cognitive complexity was the number of concepts abstracted from interviews with each CEO about their firm’s environment. They hypothesized that cognitive maps of CEOs of more diverse firms had more “comprehensive”, i.e. larger, cognitive maps than CEOs of more focused firms. This hypothesis was NOT supported. However, they also hypothesized that cognitive maps of CEOs in firms with greater international geographic scope would contain more concepts. This hypothesis was supported. Nadkarni (2003, p. 336) employed the term “comprehensiveness” to refer to the “number of concepts in a mental model.” In a study of students exposed to three different instructional methods, he hypothesized and found (1) significant differences in the comprehensiveness of the Figure1: A Simple Text Network (adapted from Carley, 1997) 69 mental models of students of student across methods and (2) greater comprehensiveness in said models among students with low-learning maturity who were exposed to a “hybrid” method of instruction, i.e. a mix of lecture-discussion and experiential learning.

Another point of consensus concerns the underlying relationships from which the text networks are constructed. Most of the quantitative and empirical studies have relied upon logical relationships among concepts in documents for that purpose. These relationships include, but are not limited to, dependence, chronology, similarity, functionality, causality, and composition (Popping, 2003, pp. 94-5). The second and less commonly used type of relationship involves the co-occurrence of concepts within a user-defined window (e.g. Carley, 1997). Notably, grammatical and lexical relationships have received no attention in the empirical literature. However, Hunter (in press) recently described a “novel”, semi-automated method of network text analysis whereby multimorphemic compounds (e.g. abbreviations, acronyms, blend words, clipped words, and compound words) in a text are linked via shared etymological roots. He applied that method to sample of seven recent winners of the Academy </context>

Also eliminated were all instances of screenplay and film jargon, e.g. ECU (extreme close-up), off-screen, VO (voice-over) and POV (point of view), as well as multi-word exclamations and interjections such as good night, goodbye, OMG (oh my God), etc. The second of the four steps of constructing a text network involves abstraction of the selected multi-morphemic compounds to higher-order concepts. In this study, each of the free (unbound) morphemes in each compound was assigned to its etymological root, typically the Indo-European, Latin, or Greek (Watkins, 2011). By definition, from every etymological root descends or originates at least one word, otherwise it is not a root. That relationship is genitive, i.e. a relational case typically expressing source, possession, or partition. It is hierarchical and directed—from the root (parent) to word (descendent). Thus, in the third step of network construction, two or more etymological roots were linked or related when words (free morphemes) descending from them co-occurred within the same word, as the following examples demonstrates. Consider a text that contains the following nine words: the closed compo</context>

Text networks were then generated using version 2.118 of the NetDraw software program embedded in UCINet. Figure 3, below, is depicted main component of the text network for the screenplay of Zero Dark Thirty. which was nominated for Best Original Screenplay in 2012. The main component is the largest group of mutuallyreachable nodes in a network. Note that the node labels are etymological roots, typically IndoEuropean (Watkins, 2011) In the case of words with non-Indo-European roots, the base form of the component of the multi-morphemic compound is used. The fourth stage involves the extraction of meaning from the completed text network. But since the investigation of meaning is not a part of this analysis, it is excluded from further consideration. See Hunter (in press) for a detailed discussion and examples. Table 3, below, summarizes some basic statistics and network metrics for the 150 screenplays in the sample.

The Kamusi Project is a multilingual online
dictionary and language-resource website at
www.kamusi.org, whose primary purpose is to
provide a unified platform designed for docu-
menting the lexicons of the world’s languages.
The main goal of this effort is a set of monolin-
gual written and audio dictionaries for both large
languages and less-resourced ones (LRLs), con-
nected together at the concept level to produce
viable bilingual dictionaries between each lan-
guage in the system, as well as bedrock linguistic
data that can be used in advanced machine appli-
cations. Linguistic data is contributed by indi-
vidual researchers and also via crowdsourcing.
As a massively multilingual dictionary project,
Kamusi has been wrestling with the conceptual
challenge of how to elicit terms in a way that
minimizes cultural bias but results in lexicons
that can be linked between languages. At the
same time, we have been developing tools that
will enable citizen lexicography without neces-
sarily involving a field researcher. Such tools
need to be highly systematic in order to yield
usable and trustworthy dictionaries.
In this paper, we first provide an overview of
Kamusi (§2); describe “balloons,” our system for
overcoming the problems of using a contact lan-
guage to elicit endangered language lexicons
(§3); introduce our smartphone application, de-
signed to gather oral data from non-literate
speakers and both oral and written data from lit-
erate speakers (§4); and, finally, discuss our ef-
forts to produce monolingual talking dictionaries,

<bodyText confidence="0.999956818181818">
The Kamusi Project, a multilingual
online dictionary website, has as one of
its goals to document the lexicons of en-
dangered and less-resourced languages
(LRLs). Kamusi.org provides a unified
platform and repository for this kind of
data that is both simple to use and free to
researchers and the public. Since Kamusi
has a separate entry for each homophone
or polyseme, it can be used to produce
sophisticated multilingual dictionaries.
We have recently been confronting issues
inherent in contact language-based lexi-
cography, especially the elicitation of
culturally-specific semantic terms, which
cannot be obtained through fieldwork
purely reliant on a contact language. To
address this, we have designed a system
of “balloons.” Based on a variety of fac-
tors, balloons raise the likelihood of re-
vealing terms and fields that have partic-
ular relevance within a culture, rather
than perpetuating linguistic bias toward
the concerns and artifacts of more power-
ful groups. Kamusi has also developed a
smartphone application which can be
used for crowdsourcing contributions and
validation. It will also be invaluable in
gathering oral data from speakers of en-
dangered languages for the production of
monolingual talking dictionaries. The
first of these projects is planned for the
Arrernte language in central Australia.

2 Kamusi as a Platform for Endangered
Language Lexicography
Several technological resources provide good
data-gathering solutions for individual lexico-
graphic projects, including Max Planck’s LEX-
US;2 TLex;3 WeSay;4 and SIL’s triad of Lexique
Pro, Toolbox, and FLEx.5 Yet each of these solu-
tions leaves gaps for the individual projects mak-
ing use of them, and none is suitable for devel-
opment of sophisticated multilingual dictionaries
as envisioned by Kamusi. The learning curve can
be steep, particularly the initial effort to set up an
effective structure for a language. Each project
must reinvent the entire process of bilingual
translation, choosing which contact language
terms to treat, working out anew how to refer-
ence different senses, and coping with or ignor-
ing non-equivalence between languages. The
comparison between two languages in different
projects is impractical or impossible, even if the
two dictionaries share one of their languages. For
example, using Lexique Pro to find terms in
Bakw6 and cross-border Bambara (both Niger-
Congo; CTMte d’Ivoire) that correspond to English
light ‘illumination’ is a Herculean research task.
One must visit the multiple entries glossed as
‘light’ in each dictionary, then compare the
Bakw6 with Bambara words to try to discern
which definition or term matches with which.6
The dissemination of data becomes an exercise
in reinventing multiple wheels: creating a web-
site and finding hosting or using the limited ser-
vices of Lexique Pro, publicizing the data’s
availability, finding a publisher who is interested
in a language without a market. More extensive
ambitions, such as mobile applications or ongo-
ing expansion of the lexicon, are unlikely to be
addressed for underfunded LRLs.
The Kamusi Project speaks to each of these
gaps. Anyone who is able to purchase an airline
ticket online has the technical skills to use the

editing system, although some concepts (such as
the difference between a definition, a translation,
and a definition translation) must be mastered
with the aid of tutorials.7 Setting up a language
involves a few hours of back-and-forth with
Kamusi staff to configure the parts of speech and
the fields for inflections and attributes that vary
from language to language. The editing system
handles all of the data fields that have been iden-
tified for the thirty-odd languages currently con-
figured for the system, with the possibility of
adding more data categories if necessary. Lexi-
con development can proceed via elicitation from
an English priority list (§3 below), or directly
from deeper lexical research. There is little am-
biguity about translation senses; each English
sense of light (homophones and polysemes) is its
own entry with a clear definition, as is each
German Licht, each Mandarin or Urdu homo-
phone and polyseme, and so on. Equivalence
between languages is shown by labeling transla-
tions as either parallel, similar, or an explanation
in language B of a term in language A (or vice
versa). When a concept in language A is linked
to a term in language B, the links from language
B to other languages are carefully tracked, along
with the degree of separation; in this way, were a
Bambara term and a Bakw6 term both linked to a
particular English sense of light, they would in-
herently be shown as second degree links to each
other, with the possibility to validate or reject the
computer pairing. Each piece of data is published
immediately upon validation, so there is no need
for the lexicographer to spend time setting up a
website, find hosting and pay for it indefinitely,
update files, manage a server, attempt search en-
gine optimization, etc. Each language will share
access to new tools and resources as they are
rolled out on Kamusi.org, such as custom print-
ing, integration with social media, and mobile
apps and other improved methods for collecting
linguistic data from community members (§3-§5
below).

er linguistic minorities, pose special challenges
for efforts at documentation. These include scar-
city of speakers and researchers, remoteness of
field sites, lack of funding, and academic evalua-
tion systems in the humanities and social scienc-
es which reward only certain kinds of investiga-
tion—to the exclusion of, notably, lexicographic
research, linguistic resource- and website-
building, and any sort of research product that is
the result of a significant number of participants
or community-based input.8
Due to the scarcity of speakers and researchers
(and especially native-speaker researchers) of
endangered languages, the process of lexico-
graphic documentation for such languages al-
most always begins with elicitation of terms
from a major contact language—English, Span-
ish, Thai, Swahili, etc.—with or without a tool
such as a word list.9 Definitions or, more often,
translation equivalents are then recorded in the
major contact language as well. It is rare to find
dictionaries with own-language definitions for
endangered or small minority languages.10
There are, however, several problems that are
inherent in using a major contact language as the
starting point for eliciting LRL lexical items.
One problem is that it inhibits the discovery of
terms and entire semantic fields which exist in
the field language but not in the contact lan-
guage. In a sense, this is akin to an archaeologist
using a metal detector—the technology will re-
veal iron objects, but ceramic artifacts will re-
main hidden. Another issue is the cultural impe-
rialism of an approach that privileges the
concepts and categories that are important to po-
litically-, religiously-, and economically-
dominant sociolinguistic groups. (For a discus-
sion of these and other issues relating to contact
language-based elicitation, see Calvet (1974),
Raison-Jourde (1977), Fabian (1983), Geeraerts
et al. (1994), Errington (2001), Anderson (2003),
8 Although the hard sciences (including computer science)
value collaborative resource-building, the traditional role of
the lone-wolf researcher persists as a powerful image
among linguists (see Crippen and Robinson (2013) and also

9 An exception to the wordlist method is the Dictionary
Development Process (DDP, http://www-01.sil.org/com
puting/ddp/) developed by Ron Moe at SIL, which steps
away from wordlists to focus on semantic domains.
10 Some exceptions are monolingual dictionaries of K’ichee’

Yiddish (Joffe &amp; Marq, 1961-1980). The latter was aban-

Enfield (2003), Bowern (2010), Mosel (2011),
and Clynes (2012), among others.) Below, we
describe how Kamusi is using a device we call
“balloons,” so that contributors can avoid these
pitfalls and expedite the production of a diction-
ary with terms derived as much as possible from
the local lexicon.
Our springboard into lexicographic elicitation
is a prioritized list of English concepts that com-
bines corpus results together with other term sets
with particular foci, such as the Comparative
African Word List11 and the basic Special Eng-
lish vocabulary list of the Voice of America.12
Our master list has some drawbacks, however
(Benjamin, 2013). As a starting point for endan-
gered languages, many highly-ranked terms are
indisputably useful: wind, bird, dry. Other terms,
however, do not exist in these languages, nor do
their speakers have much need of referencing
them: baseball, subway, century. The advantages
of a cross-cutting, English-biased concept list
certainly outweigh a haphazard butterfly-
collection approach, but rigid adherence to such
a list would foist irrelevant terms on a language
documentation team while simultaneously caus-
ing them to miss many concepts of local im-
portance.
To rectify the weaknesses of the English-
centric approach, we have designed a system of
“balloons” to prioritize terms more relevant to a
particular language. The simplest balloons attach
to the overall number of languages in which a
particular concept has been submitted.13 In addi-
tion, balloons provide lift in one language for
terms deemed important by contributors in other
languages related in some manner—for instance,
balloons can attach based on geography, lan-
guage tree proximity, shared cultural spheres, or
other aspects of affinity. When contributors are
fed a list of lexical items to elicit, balloons levi-
tate certain terms to higher positions on the list,
based on a variety of factors selected by the lan-
guage moderator or individual contributor. A
team working on a river language of Cameroon,
for example, could set balloons to raise terms
that have been treated by other Cameroonian

13 Features are under development at the time of writing that
are expected to be completed for showcasing at ComputEL
in June 2014. However, software delivery schedules are
notoriously slippery, particularly in a non-profit environ-
ment, so features such as balloons for related cultural char-
acteristics may remain temporarily promissory.

languages, by related Bantu languages, or by
other groups with a fishing economy.
Central to the mechanism of balloons is that
contributors always have the option of skipping
on the priority list terms that they do not know or
do not deem important. For example, they could
provide a term equivalent to English plant as a
living organism but skip the homophonous plant
referring to an industrial processing facility. The
vegetal sense of plant would then float upward as
more languages validate its importance, while
the industrial sense would linger in the depths.
Languages do not enter Kamusi only when a
contributor adds terms by working through a pri-
ority list; terms from other languages can be-
come incorporated via the merging of existing
lexical data sets. A team from one language
could use balloons to find concepts that exist in
related languages already in Kamusi, such as
terms glossed with explanatory translations. For
example, if the Bakwe data set is merged into
Kamusi, -sripš ‘rolled up dead leaves or cloth,
used to cushion the carrying of loads on the head
or shoulder’ would become available to Bambara
and other languages of the region, and the con-
cept would rise in importance as participants
around Africa recognized the item and provided
their equivalent term. Kamusi’s system of bal-
loons, then, ensures that the concept base availa-
ble to a given language will include many items
and semantic fields that would not otherwise
come to light.
While development of the balloons system
will still be a work in progress at the time of the
workshop for which this paper is a contribution,
and the task of choosing categories for balloons
and the amount of lift they provide will involve
ongoing adjustments in response to testing with
field lexicographers, we nevertheless want to
highlight it as a method for overcoming certain
aspects of bias in the selection of vocabulary in a
multilingual dictionary. In particular, it is pro-
posed that this method will tend to float concepts
that are most universal, while also encouraging
the development of vocabularies that have spe-
cial cultural relevance. We acknowledge, how-
ever, that this approach will not elicit concepts
that are unique to a culture and are therefore not
represented in either the English priority list or
the lists that we incorporate from other sources;
for a fine-grained investigation of local concepts,
there can be no replacement for researcher-
directed field study. Kamusi.org has other estab-
lished tools for adding such indigenous terms, as
many as lexicographers can catch in their nets.14
One of these tools is our smartphone application,
discussed in the following section.

4 The Smartphone App: Rapid Elicita-
tion and Validation from the Crowd
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999692901960784">
The Kamusi Project began as an online bilingual
dictionary between English and Swahili. The
experience of building a resource for Swahili led
to an expansion of the system to other languages,
with the technical capacity to document the full
lexical scope of any language. One of Kamusi’s
objectives is to move beyond lists of translations
between languages by creating monolingual dic-
tionaries with own-language written and/or spo-
ken definitions for each lexical item. In conjunc-
tion with this, we have developed a range of
tools designed to support online collection of
sophisticated data.15
The Big Data ambitions of this project rely on
numerous inputs of very small data, most of
which must come directly from a language’s
speakers (including through fieldwork), rather
than from digitized data sets.16 For reasons dis-
cussed in Benjamin and Radetzky (2014), relying
only on experts using Kamusi’s advanced online
tools will not be a successful strategy for the ex-
pedited production of lexicons for many LRLs.
Instead, much data collection will occur through
crowdsourcing, using validation procedures to
14 The only caveat is that a translation link must be provided
to English or another contact language in order for the new
term to be understandable by people who do not speak the
source language, which may necessitate the additional task
of creating a new entry on the contact language side.
15 There do exist online projects for baseline documentation,
but not actual lexicography, of the vocabularies of endan-
gered languages, such as LEGO (http://lego.linguistlist.org)
and PanLex (http://panlex.org), with whom we work collab-
oratively. To date, these are involved in linking wordlists
and are rarely involved in collecting new or rich data. In
their disclaimer at http://lego.linguistlist.org/disclaimer,
LEGO states, “[W]e are primarily interested in allowing
existing lexical data to be included in our datanet and pro-
moting standards to allow others to construct comparable
datanets.... [W]e have converted a number of legacy re-
sources..., but we have not engaged in collecting new lexical
data....” Regarding PanLex, Kamholz et al. (2014) write:
“[P]rojects that are designed to be panlingual tend to have
specific and limited objectives... PanLex, with its objective
of documenting only the lemmatic forms of lexemes, is no
exception.”
16 Each entry is a container for dozens of fine-grained data
elements, ranging from inflections to geo-tagged pronuncia-
tions to videos, multiplied by tens of thousands of terms in
thousands of languages, with complex translational, seman-
tic, and ontological interconnections for every concept.

ensure that the data is reliable prior to its being
integrated into the system.
In order to collect millions of pieces of lin-
guistic microdata, we have created a mobile
smartphone application, the Kamusi Fidget
Widget, that asks users specific, targeted ques-
tions about their language.17 This app gathers
data for integration into the project’s online mul-
tilingual resources, and it is designed for partici-
pants who access networks through handheld
devices—a major mode of connectivity for many
oases of endangered languages.
The Fidget Widget pilots a new approach to
eliciting terms and definitions that accelerates
data collection for LRLs and advances talking
dictionaries into monolingually-useful reference
resources, while also using Kamusi’s ballooning
to address issues of cultural bias within lexico-
graphic data collection. Version 1.0 of the app
loops through a circumscribed set of question
types, beginning with questions geared toward
the collection of individual terms. First, we pre-
sent terms and their definitions from the balloon-
modified English priority list (e.g., light ‘being
low in weight’) and ask, “What word would you
use in [your language]?” (Figure 1).

17 All programming features discussed in this section are
anticipated to be functional by June 2014.
If the system is set to field-collection mode, the
term will be accepted as is, without passing
through crowd validation procedures; in this
way, a field researcher can use the tool with one
or more consultants to rapidly generate an initial
term list. If the system is set to crowd mode,
some participants will then be asked to rate the
validity of terms submitted by other contributors
(Figure 2).

This system is well-tailored for researcher-driven
fieldwork or written languages with numerous
speakers who have persistent smartphone net-
work access.
In many cases, the people involved in preserv-
ing a language speak it but do not write it. The
app’s 2.0 version is intended to extend the mo-
bile technology to languages that are not com-
monly written or do not have a critical mass of
participants, or both.18 Although network access
is currently necessary to use the system, an of-
fline version is anticipated when synchronization
and funding issues are resolved. The principal
new feature of version 2.0 will be the collection
of structured audio data, including pronuncia-
tions, own-language definitions, and possible
retellings of the definitions in a contact language.
This is discussed in the following section.

5 Monolingual Talking Dictionaries
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991955555556">
Talking (or audio) dictionaries are an important
technology for preserving the sounds of particu-
lar languages and dialects. Traditionally, for
LRLs, the sound files simply appear in associa-
tion with contact-language descriptions or trans-
lations of the terms.19 Other language preserva-
tion projects endeavor to record stories as told by
speakers of endangered languages, with italk li-
brary (italklibrary.com) providing an excellent
example for Australia. The Fidget Widget’s ver-
sion 2 approach to talking dictionaries combines
the idea of codifying the sounds of a language
and the practice of preserving narratives about
what a culture’s concepts represent.
The new version will proceed as follows. Af-
ter finishing version 1’s set of questions focused
on the gathering of lexical terms, the app will
request that each term be pronounced. The
smartphone will provide a visual countdown and
a beep. This process will yield data on a par with
most (if not all) talking dictionaries for endan-
gered languages: as mentioned above, this con-
sists of the written lexical item, the contact-
language gloss, and a sound file of the term be-
ing pronounced in the indigenous language. The
third step will ask the user to explain the concept
in their language, with a timer to encourage brev-
ity. It will be necessary to tinker with the timing
system to find a sweet spot that allows answers
of good quality, minimizes stress, and does not
cut speakers off mid-stride but still discourages
rambling. The fourth step will ask the user for a
similarly pithy explanation of the concept in a
contact language that they know. In the Australi-
an case, where almost all participants also speak
English, the contributors will also be asked to
provide an English resume of their own-language
definition, providing a gateway for people who
are not already familiar with the language—
including many of their own youth. With these
simple procedures that integrate the basic capaci-
ties of smartphones with the data design of
Kamusi, talking dictionaries will become valua-
ble internal reference sources for their own
communities, as well as repositories that enable

18 The existence of some sort of functional Unicode-
supported orthography and the involvement of at least one
person who can bridge writing and orality are minimum
conditions for participating in the system. Where orthogra-
phies are still in contention, Kamusi’s internal structure is
programmed to support multiple writing systems.

and English) (http://koasati.wm.edu); the Nganasan Multi-

interested others to support the language’s con-
tinued existence and revitalization.
Working with italk library, Kamusi’s design of
the app’s version 2.0 is being developed for the
Arrernte community as first users; a field trial
with the initial one hundred terms from the
Kamusi priority list is scheduled to be completed
before late June 2014. The Arrernte are interest-
ed in preserving the specific terms of their lan-
guage as well as the way they are expressed in
context, and they also want to revitalize the
tongue’s use among its younger generations. The
stories that italk library has been recording have
proven enjoyable, but they do not provide a
structure for accessing content in a way focused
on reference or language learning. The mobile
app will be used to term by term elicit pointillis-
tic accounts and working definitions, keyed to
each term’s dictionary data container, that to-
gether paint a full picture of the language and
culture. For example, Kamusi’s English defini-
tion of the adjective yellow is ‘being of the color
of sunflowers or ripe lemons, between green and
orange in the visible light spectrum’.20 A con-
tributor from the Australian group might say (in
Arrernte or in English), “Yellow is, like, it’s the
color that we see, it’s the color of the sun when
it’s going down, before it turns orange like a
cooling fire,” and such an unedited vignette
would serve as the talking definition.
In addition to own-language definitions, rec-
orded English definitions will make it possible to
transcribe the meanings of each term with the aid
of a wider crowd (who do not necessarily speak
the endangered language); as text, transcriptions
can be indexed and searched to provide access to
the dictionary data through technological tools.
Transcription of the own-language definitions is
not planned in the near term, but it remains a de-
sirable possibility with time and resources, espe-
cially as a community activity. In the first itera-
tion, terms will be elicited via the mobile app
from the English list (since little “ballooning”
will be in effect for the first language from the
Australian continent to enter the Kamusi sys-
tem), but it will also be possible to upload native
concepts to the system and then use the app for
gathering audio.
Monolingual dictionaries have not generally
been conceived of as practical for endangered
languages, and sophisticated multilingual dic-

(Zgusta, 1971: 210; Haensch, 1991; Landau,
2001: 11). The tools and methods discussed in
this article, however, make it possible to docu-
ment endangered languages effectively, both by
(a) generating term lists rapidly and in associa-
tion with concepts from related languages, and
(b) incorporating spoken definitions that encap-
sulate the essence of each idea. As mentioned
above, the result will be a useful resource for the
community, something that can be understood by
the segment that does not read the contact lan-
guage and used by younger generations interest-
ed in revitalization. Additionally, the system
produces bridges to many other languages, al-
lowing local knowledge to endure beyond the
boundaries of shrinking linguistic communities.

Kamusi.org has a long task list, with a goal of
providing a full range of lexical resources for
both people and machines. Some of these objec-
tives, such as detection of malicious users and
validation procedures for crowdsourced data, are
informatics challenges. Many other objectives
are technical, and will apply across all lan-
guages—enhancements to the data model for
bridging concepts that are expressed with differ-
ent parts of speech in different languages (e.g.,
where colors act as verbs), and a host of im-
provements to the editing system based on les-
sons learned during the multilingual pilot phase.
A few are noteworthy in this concluding section
because of their specific interest to endangered
languages.
Determining the boundary between a language
and a dialect is frequently problematic. In the
case of two tongues (Kinyarwanda and Kirundi)
that are often considered dialects separated by a
political border, Kamusi discovered in the pro-
cess of creating separate dictionaries that there
are substantial differences between the two
which had not previously been documented.
However, it would be impractical to create full
dictionaries of every dialect of a language when
a large portion of their vocabularies are shared.
We will therefore produce a system to geo-tag
entries based on where a term is known to be in
use. As the map becomes populated with zones
of use, it will be possible to visualize where one
dialect fades into the next, and where one lan-
guage territory ends and the next begins. Similar-
ly, programming is planned for geo-tagging the
specific location where a participating speaker in
a talking dictionary acquired their language (in-

cluding people contributing pronunciations for
well-resourced languages). This will build an
audio portrait of dialect, sociolinguistic, gender,
and other variation. These mapping features,
combined with expanded data collection, will
enhance the possibilities for linguists to study
language contact, spread, and historical change.
Other improvements and new features, such as
an app to upload photos of cultural items directly
to a dictionary entry, or the expansion of audio
features to the existing open-ended cultural notes
field, will allow contributors to flesh out diction-
ary entries with relevant ethnographic infor-
mation that contextualizes a language within the
lives of the people who speak it.
In terms of innovations to the system itself, we
see as a priority the development of offline input
systems, both for contributors who want to use
an interface like the one at www.kamusi.org, as
well as those who wish to use the smartphone
app when not connected to the internet. In fact,
we did release offline software for the bilingual
dictionary between English and Swahili, but the
multilingual model added so many complexities
that the program must be completely rewritten.
Synchronization and the management of large
data sets on small devices are major technical
challenges, which can only be tackled with solid
funding. Similarly, money permitting, we aim to
code the system architecture to include a privacy
system for linguistic groups who wish to docu-
ment but also restrict access to certain lexical
items (e.g., taboo words) or even their entire lan-
guage. In addition, as we discussed in Benjamin
and Radetzky (2014), we are committed to in-
corporating gamification, or games with a pur-
pose, into both mobile and web platforms (Cas-
tellote et al., 2013; Paraschakis, 2013; Hamari et
al., 2014). This will propel the accumulation of
data and its validation by the crowd, pushing the
project along the path toward obtaining as much
open data for as many languages as possible.
Market forces will never support the creation
of widely-available print dictionaries for most
LRLs, and scholarly interest and available fund-
ing for online dictionaries will remain hit-or-
miss, even as languages fade away. The tools
presented in this paper are offered as methods for
rapidly and reliably developing lexicographic
resources for the world’s endangered languages.

As a starting point for endangered languages, many highly-ranked terms are indisputably useful: wind, bird, dry. Other terms, however, do not exist in these languages, nor do their speakers have much need of referencing them: baseball, subway, century. The advantages of a cross-cutting, English-biased concept list certainly outweigh a haphazard butterflycollection approach, but rigid adherence to such a list would foist irrelevant terms on a language documentation team while simultaneously causing them to miss many concepts of local importance.

One of Kamusi’s objectives is to move beyond lists of translations between languages by creating monolingual dictionaries with own-language written and/or spoken definitions for each lexical item. In conjunction with this, we have developed a range of tools designed to support online collection of sophisticated data.15 The Big Data ambitions of this project rely on numerous inputs of very small data, most of which must come directly from a language’s speakers (including through fieldwork), rather than from digitized data sets.16 For reasons discussed in Benjamin and Radetzky (2014), relying only on experts using Kamusi’s advanced online tools will not be a successful strategy for the expedited production of lexicons for many LRLs. Instead, much data collection will occur through crowdsourcing, using validation procedures to 14 The only caveat is that a translation link must be provided to English or another contact language in order for the new term to be understandable by people who do not speak the source language, which may necessitate the additional task of creating a new entry on the contact language side. 15 There do exist online projects for baseline documentatio</context>

Automatic detection of figurative language
is a challenging task in computational lin-
guistics. Recognising both literal and fig-
urative meaning is not trivial for a ma-
chine and in some cases it is hard even
for humans. For this reason novel and
accurate systems able to recognise figura-
tive languages are necessary. We present
in this paper a novel computational model
capable to detect sarcasm in the social
network Twitter (a popular microblogging
service which allows users to post short
messages). Our model is easy to imple-
ment and, unlike previous systems, it does
not include patterns of words as features.
Our seven sets of lexical features aim to
detect sarcasm by its inner structure (for
example unexpectedness, intensity of the
terms or imbalance between registers), ab-
stracting from the use of specific terms.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999797">
Sarcasm is a mode of communication where literal
and intended meanings are in opposition. Sarcasm
is often used to express a negative message using
positive words. Automatic detection of sarcasm is
then very important in the sentiment analysis field,
as a sarcastic phrase that includes positive words
conveys a negative message and can be easily mis-
understood by an automatic system.
A number of systems with the objective of de-
tecting sarcasm have been designed in the past
years (Davidov et al., 2010; Gonz´alez-Ib´a˜nez et
al., 2011; Riloff et al., 2013). All these computa-
tional models have in common the use of frequent
and typical sarcastic expressions as features. This
is of course a good approach as some words are
used sarcastically more often than others.
Our research seeks to avoid the use of words as
features, for two reasons. Firstly, we want to re-
duce the complexity of the computational model,
decreasing drastically the number of features re-
quired for classification. Secondly, typical sarcas-
tic expressions are often culturally specific (an ex-
pression that is considered sarcastic in British En-
glish is not necessary sarcastic in American En-
glish and vice-versa). For these reasons we have
designed a system that aims to detect sarcasm
without the use of words and patterns of words.
We use simple features such as punctuation (Car-
valho et al., 2009) and more sophisticated features,
that for example detect imbalance between regis-
ters (the use of an “out of context” word may sug-
gest sarcastic intentions) or the use of very intense
terms.
We study sarcasm detection in the micro-
blogging platform Twitter1 that allows users to
send and read text messages (shorter than 140
characters) called tweets, which often do not fol-
low the expected rules of the grammar. The dataset
we adopted contains positive examples tagged as
sarcastic by the users (using the hashtag #sarcasm)
and negative examples (tagged with a different
hashtag). This methodology has been previously
used in similar studies (Reyes et al., 2013; Lukin
and Walker, 2013; Liebrecht et al., 2013).
We presented in Barbieri and Saggion (2014) a
model capable of detecting irony, in this paper we
add important features to this model and evaluate
a new corpus to determine if our system is capa-
ble of detecting tweets marked as sarcastic (#sar-
casm). The contributions of this paper are the fol-
lowing:

A standard definition for sarcasm seems not to ex-
ist. Sarcasm is often identified as irony or verbal
irony (?). Irony has been defined in several ways
over the years as for example “saying the opposite
of what you mean” (Quintilien and Butler, 1953),
or by Grice (1975) as a rhetorical figure that vio-
lates the maxim of quality: “Do not say what you
believe to be false”, or as any form of negation
with no negation markers (Giora, 1995). Other
definitions are the ones of Wilson and Sperber
(2002) who states irony is an echoic utterance that
shows a negative aspect of someone’s else opinion,
and as form of pretence by Utsumi (2000) and by
Veale and Hao (2010a). Veale states that “ironic
speakers usually craft their utterances in spite of
what has just happened, not because of it. The
pretence alludes to, or echoes, an expectation that
has been violated”.
Irony and sarcasm has been approached as
computation problem recently by Carvalho et al.
(2009) who created an automatic system for de-
tecting irony relying on emoticons and special
punctuation. They focused on detection of ironic
style in newspaper articles. Veale and Hao (2010b)
proposed an algorithm for separating ironic from
non-ironic similes, detecting common terms used
in this ironic comparison. Reyes et al. (2013) and
also Barbieri and Saggion (2014) have recently
proposed two approaches to detect irony in Twit-
ter. There are also some computational model to
detect sarcasm in Twitter. The systems of Gon-
zalez et al. (2011) and Davidov et al. (2010) de-
tect sarcasm with good accuracy in English tweets
(the latter model is also studied in the Amazon
review context). Lukin and Walker (2013) used
bootstrapping to improve the performance of sar-
casm and nastiness classifiers for Online Dialogue,
and Liebrecht et al. (2013) designed a model to de-
tect sarcasm in Duch tweets. Finally Riloff (2013)
built a model to detect sarcasm with a bootstrap-
ping algorithm that automatically learn lists of
positive sentiments phrases and negative situation
phrases from sarcastic tweet, in order to detect the
characteristic of sarcasm of being a contrast be-
tween positive sentiment and negative situation.
One may argue that sarcasm and irony are the
same linguistic phenomena, but in our opinion the
latter is more similar to mocking or making jokes
(sometimes about ourselves) in a sharp and non-
offensive manner. On the other hand, sarcasm is
a meaner form of irony as it tends to be offensive
and directed towards other people (or products like
in Amazon reviews). Textual examples of sarcasm
lack the sharp tone of an aggressive speaker, so
for textual purposes we think irony and sarcasm
should be considered as different phenomena and
studied separately (Reyes et al., 2013).
Some datasets exist for the study of sarcasm and
irony. Filatova (2012) designed a corpus genera-
tion experiment where regular and sarcastic Ama-
zon product reviews were collected. Also Bosco
et. al (2013) collected and annotate a set of ironic
examples (in Italian) for the study of sentiment
analysis and opinion mining.

3 Data and Text Processing
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99991585">
We adopted a corpus of 60,000 tweets equally
divided into six different topics: Sarcasm, Edu-
cation, Humour, Irony, Politics and Newspaper.
The Newspaper set includes 10,000 tweets from
three popular newspapers (New York Times, The
Economist and The Guardian). The rest of the
tweets (50,000) were automatically selected by
looking at Twitter hashtags #education, #humour,
#irony, #politics and #sarcasm) added by users in
order to link their contribution to a particular sub-
ject and community. These hashtags are removed
from the tweets for the experiments. According to
Reyes et al. (2013), these hashtags were selected
for three main reasons: (i) to avoid manual se-
lection of tweets, (ii) to allow irony analysis be-
yond literary uses, and because (iii) irony hash-
tag may “reflect a tacit belief about what consti-
tutes irony” (and sarcasm in the case of the hash-
tag #sarcasm). Education, Humour and Politics
tweets were prepared by Reyes et al. (2013), we

added Irony, Newspaper and Sarcasm tweets2. We
obtained these data using the Twitter API.
Examples of tweets tagged with #sarcasm are:

<bodyText confidence="0.999786">
Another corpora is employed in our approach to
measure the frequency of word usage. We adopted
the Second Release of the American National Cor-
pus Frequency Data3 (Ide and Suderman, 2004),
which provides the number of occurrences of a
word in the written and spoken ANC. From now
on, we will mean with “frequency of a term” the
absolute frequency the term has in the ANC.
Processing microblog text is not easy because
they are noisy, with little context, and often En-
glish grammar rules are violated. For these rea-
sons, in order to process the tweets, we use the
GATE Plugin TwitIE (Bontcheva et al., 2013) as
tokeniser and Part of Speech Tagger. The POS
tagger (adapted version of the Stanford tagger
(Toutanova et al., 2003)) achieves 90.54% token
accuracy, which is a very good results knowing
the difficulty of the task in the microblogging con-
text. This POS tagger is more accurate and reliable
than the method we used in the previous research,
where the POS of a term was defined by the most
commonly used (provided by WordNet). TwitIE
also includes the best Named Entity Recognitions
for Twitter (F1=0.8).
We adopted also Rita WordNet API (Howe,
2009) and Java API for WordNet Searching (Spell,
2009) to perform operations on WordNet synsets.

<bodyText confidence="0.957518909090909">
as we read in the web site, a massive electronic collection of
American English words (15 million)
(e.g. Naive Bayes) as some of our features are not.
Since we approach the problem as a binary deci-
sion we picked a tree-based classifiers: Decision
Tree. We already studied the performance of an-
other classifier (Random Forest) but even if Ran-
dom Forest performed better in cross validation
experiments, Decision Tree resulted better in cross
domain experiments, suggesting that it would be
more reliable in a real situation (where the nega-
tive topics are several). We use the Decision Tree
implementation of the Weka toolkit (Witten and
Frank, 2005).
Our model uses seven groups of features to rep-
resent each tweet. Some of them are designed
to detect imbalance and unexpectedness, others
to detect common patterns in the structure of the
sarcastic tweets (like type of punctuation, length,
emoticons), and some others to recognise senti-
ments and intensity of the terms used. Below is
an overview of the group of features in our model:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999846">
• Frequency (gap between rare and common
words)
• Written-Spoken (written-spoken style uses)
• Intensity (intensity of adverbs and adjectives)
• Structure (length, punctuation, emoticons)
• Sentiments (gap between positive and nega-
tive terms)
• Synonyms (common vs. rare synonyms use)
• Ambiguity (measure ofpossible ambiguities)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99978525">
To the best of our knowledge Frequency, Written
Spoken, Intensity and Synonyms groups have not
been used before in similar studies. The other
groups have been used already (for example by
Carvalho et al. (2009) or Reyes et al. (2013)) yet
our implementation is different.
In the following sections we quickly describe all
the features we used.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.983712">
4.1 Frequency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999534428571429">
Unexpectedness can be a signal of verbal irony,
Lucariello (1994) claims that irony is strictly con-
nected to surprise, showing that unexpectedness is
the feature most related to situational ironies. In
this first group of features we try to detect it. We
explore the frequency imbalance between words,
i.e. register inconsistencies between terms of the

same tweet. The idea is that the use of many words
commonly used in English (i.e. high frequency in
ANC) and only a few terms rarely used in English
(i.e. low frequency in ANC) in the same sentence
creates imbalance that may cause unexpectedness,
since within a single tweet only one kind of regis-
ter is expected.
Three features belong to this group: frequency
mean, rarest word, frequency gap. The first one
is the arithmetic average of all the frequencies of
the words in a tweet, and it is used to detect the
frequency style of a tweet. The second one, rarest
word, is the frequency value of the rarest word,
designed to capture the word that may create im-
balance. The assumption is that very rare words
may be a sign of irony. The third one is the abso-
lute difference between the first two and it is used
to measure the imbalance between them, and cap-
ture a possible intention of surprise.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984223">
4.2 Written-Spoken
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99999075">
Twitter is composed of written text, but an infor-
mal spoken English style is often used. We de-
signed this set of features to explore the unexpect-
edness created by using spoken style words in a
mainly written style tweet or vice versa (formal
words usually adopted in written text employed in
a spoken style context). We can analyse this aspect
with ANC written and spoken, as we can see us-
ing this corpora whether a word is more often used
in written or spoken English. There are three fea-
tures in this group: written mean, spoken mean,
written spoken gap. The first and second ones are
the means of the frequency values, respectively, in
written and spoken ANC corpora of all the words
in the tweet. The third one, written spoken gap,
is the absolute value of the difference between the
first two, designed to see if ironic writers use both
styles (creating imbalance) or only one of them. A
low difference between written and spoken styles
means that both styles are used.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994765">
4.3 Structure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996823255814">
With this group of features we want to study the
structure of the tweet: if it is long or short (length),
if it contains long or short words (mean of word
length), and also what kind of punctuation is used
(exclamation marks, emoticons, etc.).
The length feature consists of the number of
characters that compose the tweet, n. words is
the number of words, and words length mean is
the mean of the words length. Moreover, we use
the number of verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs
as features, naming them n. verbs, n. nouns, n.
adjectives and n. adverbs. With these last four
features we also computed the ratio of each part
of speech to the number of words in the tweet; we
called them verb ratio, noun ratio, adjective ra-
tio, and adverb ratio. All these features have the
purpose of capturing the style of the writer.
The punctuation feature is the sum of the num-
ber of commas, full stops, ellipsis and exclama-
tion that a tweet presents. We also added a feature
called laughing which is the sum of all the inter-
net laughs, denoted with hahah, lol, rofl, and lmao
that we consider as a new form of punctuation: in-
stead of using many exclamation marks internet
users may use the sequence lol (i.e. laughing out
loud) or just type hahaha.
Inspired by Davidov et al. (2010) and Carvalho
(2009) we designed features related to punctua-
tion. These features are: number of commas, full
stops, ellipsis, exclamation and quotation marks
that a tweet contain.
The emoticon feature is the sum of the emoti-
cons :), :D, :( and ;) in a tweet.
The new features we included are http that sim-
ply says if a tweet includes or not an Internet
link, and the entities features provided by TwitIE
(Bontcheva et al., 2013). These features check if a
tweet contains the following entities: n. organisa-
tion, n. location, n. person, n. first person, n. title,
n job title, n. date. These last seven features were
not available in the previous model, and some of
them work very well when distinguishing sarcasm
from newspaper tweets.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.921959">
4.4 Intensity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872333333334">
In order to produce a sarcastic effect some authors
might use an expression which is antonymic to
what they are trying to describe (saying the op-
posite of what they mean (Quintilien and Butler,
1953)). In the case the word being an adjective
or adverb its intensity (more or less exaggerated)
may well play a role in producing the intended ef-
fect (Riloff et al., 2013). We adopted the intensity
scores of Potts (2011) who uses naturally occur-
ring metadata (star ratings on service and prod-
uct reviews) to construct adjectives and adverbs
scales. An example of adjective scale (and relative
scores in brackets) could be the following: horri-
ble (-1.9) → bad (-1.1) → good (0.2) → nice (0.3)
→ great (0.8).
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997266">
53
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999665">
With these scores we evaluate four features for
adjective intensity and four for adverb intensity
(implemented in the same way): adj (adv) tot,
adj (adv) mean, adj (adv) max, and adj (adv)
gap. The sum of the AdjScale scores of all the ad-
jectives in the tweet is called adj tot. adj mean is
adj tot divided by the number of adjectives in the
tweet. The maximum AdjScale score within a sin-
gle tweet is adj max. Finally, adj gap is the differ-
ence between adj max and adj mean, designed to
see “how much” the most intense adjective is out
of context.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.967364">
4.5 Synonyms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973571428571">
As previously said, sarcasm convey two messages
to the audience at the same time. It follows that the
choice of a term (rather than one of its synonyms)
is very important in order to send the second, not
obvious, message.
For each word of a tweet we get its synonyms
with WordNet (Miller, 1995), then we calculate
their ANC frequencies and sort them into a de-
creasing ranked list (the actual word is part of this
ranking as well). We use these rankings to define
the four features which belong to this group. The
first one is syno lower which is the number of syn-
onyms of the word wi with frequency lower than
the frequency of wi. It is defined as in Equation 1:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.978781">
slwi = |syni,k : f(syni,k) &lt; f(wi) |(1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996247">
where syni,k is the synonym of wi with rank k,
and f(x) the ANC frequency of x. Then we also
defined syno lower mean as mean of slwi (i.e. the
arithmetic average of slwi over all the words of a
tweet).
We also designed two more features: syno
lower gap and syno greater gap, but to define
them we need two more parameters. The first one
is word lowest syno that is the maximum slwi in a
tweet. It is formally defined as:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.524435333333333">
{|syni,k : f(syni,k) &lt; f(wi)|}
The second one is word greatest syno defined as:
{|syni,k : f(syni,k) &gt; f(wi)|}
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999063666666667">
We are now able to describe syno lower gap
which detects the imbalance that creates a com-
mon synonym in a context of rare synonyms. It is
the difference between word lowest syno and syno
lower mean. Finally, we detect the gap of very
rare synonyms in a context of common ones with
syno greater gap. It is the difference between
word greatest syno and syno greater mean, where
syno greater mean is the following:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.903064666666667">
|syni,k : f(syni,k) &gt; f(wi)|
sgmt = (4)
n. words of t
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.999961571428572">
The arithmetic averages of syno greater gap
and of syno lower gap in the Sarcasm corpus are
higher than in the other topics, suggesting that a
very common (or very rare) synonym is often used
out of context i.e. a very rare synonym when most
of the words are common (have a high rank in our
model) and vice versa.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.950821">
4.6 Ambiguity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988833333334">
Another interesting aspect of sarcasm is ambi-
guity. We noticed that sarcastic tweets presents
words with more meanings (more WordNet
synsets). Our assumption is that if a word has
many meanings the possibility of “saying some-
thing else” with this word is higher than in a term
that has only a few meanings, then higher possibil-
ity of sending more then one message (literal and
intended) at the same time.
There are three features that aim to capture
these aspects: synset mean, max synset, and
synset gap. The first one is the mean of the num-
ber of synsets of each word of the tweet, to see if
words with many meanings are often used in the
tweet. The second one is the greatest number of
synsets that a single word has; we consider this
word the one with the highest possibility of being
used ironically (as multiple meanings are available
to say different things). In addition, we calculate
synset gap as the difference between the number
of synsets of this word (max synset) and the av-
erage number of synsets (synset mean), assuming
that if this gap is high the author may have used
that inconsistent word intentionally.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.960585">
4.7 Sentiments
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999564625">
We also evaluate the sentiment of the sarcas-
tic tweets. The SentiWordNet sentiment lexicon
(Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) assigns to each synset
of WordNet sentiment scores of positivity and neg-
ativity. We used these scores to examine what kind
of sentiments characterises sarcasm. We explore
ironic sentiments with two different views: the
first one is the simple analysis of sentiments (to

ond one concerns sentiment imbalances between
words.
There are six features in the Sentiments group.
The first one is named positive sum and it is the
sum of all the positive scores in a tweet, the sec-
ond one is negative sum, defined as sum of all the
negative scores. The arithmetic average of the pre-
vious ones is another feature, named positive neg-
ative mean, designed to reveal the sentiment that
better describe the whole tweet. Moreover, there
is positive-negative gap that is the difference be-
tween the first two features, as we wanted also to
detect the positive/negative imbalance within the
same tweet.
The imbalance may be created using only one
single very positive (or negative) word in the
tweet, and the previous features will not be able
to detect it, thus we needed to add two more. For
this purpose the model includes positive single
gap defined as the difference between most posi-
tive word and the mean of all the sentiment scores
of all the words of the tweet and negative single
gap defined in the same way, but with the most
negative one.

10.000 sarcastic and 10.000 of non-sarcastic ex-

The best results are obtained when our model has
to distinguish Sarcasm from Newspaper tweets.
This was expected as the task was simpler than the

present an internet link, and this aspect can be used
to well distinguish sarcasm as internet links are not
used often. Moreover the Newspaper tweets use a
formal language easily distinguishable from sar-
casm. In Newspaper tweets there are more nouns
(average ratio of 0.5) than in sarcastic tweets (ratio

than sarcasm. Overall Newspaper results are very
good, the F1 is over 0.95.
Education and Politics results are very good as
well, F1 of 0.90 and 0.92. Also in these topics the
internet link is a good feature. Other powerful fea-
tures in these two topics are noun ratio (as News-
paper they present more number of nouns than sar-
casm), question, rarest val. (sarcasm includes
less frequently used words) and syno lower.
Results regarding sarcasm versus Humour are
positive, F-Measure is above 0.87. The most
marked differences between Humour and sar-
casm are the following. Humour includes more
links (http), more question marks are used to
mark jokes like: “Do you know the difference
between...?”, “What is an elephant doing...?”
(question), sarcasm includes rarer terms and more
intense adverbs than Humour (rarest val., adv.
max).
Our model struggles to detect tweets marked as
sarcastic from the ones marked as ironic. Even
if not very powerful, relevant features to detect
sarcasm against irony are two: use of adverbs
(sarcasm uses less but more intense adverbs) and
sentiment scores (as expected sarcastic tweets are
denoted by more positive sentiments than irony).
Poor results in this topic indicate that irony and
sarcasm have similar structures in our model,
and that new features are necessary to distinguish
them.

In this study we evaluate our system to detect sar-
casm in the social network Twitter. We tackle this
problem as binary classification, where the nega-
tive topics are Education, Humour, Irony, News-
paper and Politics. The originality of our system
is avoiding the use of pattern of words as feature to
detect sarcasm. In spite of the good results, there
is much space for improvement. We can still en-
hance our results by including additional features
such as language models. We will also run new ex-
periments with different negative topics and differ-
ent kind of text, for example on Amazon reviews
as Davidov et al. (2010). Finally, a very interesting
but challenging issue will be distinguishing with
better accuracy sarcasm from irony.

Recognising both literal and figurative meaning is not trivial for a machine and in some cases it is hard even for humans. For this reason novel and accurate systems able to recognise figurative languages are necessary. We present in this paper a novel computational model capable to detect sarcasm in the social network Twitter (a popular microblogging service which allows users to post short messages). Our model is easy to implement and, unlike previous systems, it does not include patterns of words as features. Our seven sets of lexical features aim to detect sarcasm by its inner structure (for example unexpectedness, intensity of the terms or imbalance between registers), abstracting from the use of specific terms.</abstract>

We study sarcasm detection in the microblogging platform Twitter1 that allows users to send and read text messages (shorter than 140 characters) called tweets, which often do not follow the expected rules of the grammar. The dataset we adopted contains positive examples tagged as sarcastic by the users (using the hashtag #sarcasm) and negative examples (tagged with a different hashtag). This methodology has been previously used in similar studies (Reyes et al., 2013; Lukin and Walker, 2013; Liebrecht et al., 2013). We presented in Barbieri and Saggion (2014) a model capable of detecting irony, in this paper we add important features to this model and evaluate a new corpus to determine if our system is capable of detecting tweets marked as sarcastic (#sarcasm).

The pretence alludes to, or echoes, an expectation that has been violated”. Irony and sarcasm has been approached as computation problem recently by Carvalho et al. (2009) who created an automatic system for detecting irony relying on emoticons and special punctuation. They focused on detection of ironic style in newspaper articles. Veale and Hao (2010b) proposed an algorithm for separating ironic from non-ironic similes, detecting common terms used in this ironic comparison. Reyes et al. (2013) and also Barbieri and Saggion (2014) have recently proposed two approaches to detect irony in Twitter. There are also some computational model to detect sarcasm in Twitter. The systems of Gonzalez et al. (2011) and Davidov et al. (2010) detect sarcasm with good accuracy in English tweets (the latter model is also studied in the Amazon review context).

Another corpora is employed in our approach to measure the frequency of word usage. We adopted the Second Release of the American National Corpus Frequency Data3 (Ide and Suderman, 2004), which provides the number of occurrences of a word in the written and spoken ANC. From now on, we will mean with “frequency of a term” the absolute frequency the term has in the ANC. Processing microblog text is not easy because they are noisy, with little context, and often English grammar rules are violated. For these reasons, in order to process the tweets, we use the GATE Plugin TwitIE (Bontcheva et al., 2013) as tokeniser and Part of Speech Tagger. The POS tagger (adapted version of the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003)) achieves 90.54% token accuracy, which is a very good results knowing the difficulty of the task in the microblogging context. This POS tagger is more accurate and reliable than the method we used in the previous research, where the POS of a term was defined by the most commonly used (provided by WordNet).

Sarcasm is often used to express a negative message using positive words. Automatic detection of sarcasm is then very important in the sentiment analysis field, as a sarcastic phrase that includes positive words conveys a negative message and can be easily misunderstood by an automatic system. A number of systems with the objective of detecting sarcasm have been designed in the past years (Davidov et al., 2010; Gonz´alez-Ib´a˜nez et al., 2011; Riloff et al., 2013). All these computational models have in common the use of frequent and typical sarcastic expressions as features. This is of course a good approach as some words are used sarcastically more often than others. Our research seeks to avoid the use of words as features, for two reasons. Firstly, we want to reduce the complexity of the computational model, decreasing drastically the number of features required for classification. Secondly, typical sarcastic expressions are often culturally specific (an expression that is considered sarcastic i</context>

The SentiWordNet sentiment lexicon (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) assigns to each synset of WordNet sentiment scores of positivity and negativity.

I think I did really well. • Jeez I just love when I’m trying to eat lunch and someone’s blowing smoke in my face. Yum. I love ingesting cigarette smoke. Another corpora is employed in our approach to measure the frequency of word usage. We adopted the Second Release of the American National Corpus Frequency Data3 (Ide and Suderman, 2004), which provides the number of occurrences of a word in the written and spoken ANC. From now on, we will mean with “frequency of a term” the absolute frequency the term has in the ANC. Processing microblog text is not easy because they are noisy, with little context, and often English grammar rules are violated.

In the following sections we quickly describe all the features we used. 4.1 Frequency Unexpectedness can be a signal of verbal irony, Lucariello (1994) claims that irony is strictly connected to surprise, showing that unexpectedness is the feature most related to situational ironies. In this first group of features we try to detect it. We explore the frequency imbalance between words, i.e. register inconsistencies between terms of the 52 same tweet. The idea is that the use of many words commonly used in English (i.e. high frequency in ANC) and only a few terms rarely used in English (i.e. low frequency in ANC) in the same sentence creates imbalance that may cause unexpectedness, since within a single tweet only one kind of register is expec</context>

The dataset we adopted contains positive examples tagged as sarcastic by the users (using the hashtag #sarcasm) and negative examples (tagged with a different hashtag).

Finally, adj gap is the difference between adj max and adj mean, designed to see “how much” the most intense adjective is out of context. 4.5 Synonyms As previously said, sarcasm convey two messages to the audience at the same time. It follows that the choice of a term (rather than one of its synonyms) is very important in order to send the second, not obvious, message. For each word of a tweet we get its synonyms with WordNet (Miller, 1995), then we calculate their ANC frequencies and sort them into a decreasing ranked list (the actual word is part of this ranking as well). We use these rankings to define the four features which belong to this group. The first one is syno lower which is the number of synonyms of the word wi with frequency lower than the frequency of wi. It is defined as in Equation 1: slwi = |syni,k : f(syni,k) &lt; f(wi) |(1) where syni,k is the synonym of wi with rank k, and f(x) the ANC frequency of x.

The idea is that the use of many words commonly used in English (i.e. high frequency in ANC) and only a few</context>

Poor results in this topic indicate that irony and sarcasm have similar structures in our model, and that new features are necessary to distinguish them. Prec.

Sarcasm corpus is compared to Education, Humour, Irony, Newspaper, and Politics corpora.The classifier used is Decision Tree The comparison with other similar systems is not easy. We obtain better results than Reyes et al. (2013) and than Barbieri and Saggion (2014), but the positive class in their experiments is irony. The system of Davidov et al. (2010) to detect sarcasm seems to be powerful as well, and their results can compete with ours, but in the mentioned study there is no negative topic distinction, the notsarcastic topic is not a fixed domain (and our con56 trolled experiments results show that depending on the negative example the task can be more or less difficult). 7 Conclusion and Future Work In this study we evaluate our system to detect sarcasm in the social network Twitter.

Since we approach the problem as a binary decision we picked a tree-based classifiers: Decision Tree. We already studied the performance of another classifier (Random Forest) but even if Random Forest performed better in cross validation experiments, Decision Tree resulted better in cross domain experiments, suggesting that it would be more reliable in a real situation (where the negative topics are several). We use the Decision Tree implementation of the Weka toolkit (Witten and Frank, 2005). Our model uses seven groups of features to represent each tweet. Some of them are designed to detect imbalance and unexpectedness, others to detect common patterns in the structure of the sarcastic tweets (like type of punctuation, length, emoticons), and some others to recognise sentiments and intensity of the terms used. Below is an overview of the group of features in our model: • Frequency (gap between rare and common words) • Written-Spoken (written-spoken style uses) • Intensity (intensity of adverbs and adjectives) • Structure (length, punctuation, emoticons) • Sentiments (gap between</context>

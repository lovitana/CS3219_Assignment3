This paper describes NaDiR (Naive DIstributional Response generation), a corpus-based system
that, from a set of word stimuli as an input, generates a response word relying on association
strength and distributional similarity. NaDiR participated in the CogALex 2014 shared task on
multiword associations (restricted systems track), operationalizing the task as a ranking problem:
candidate words from a large vocabulary are ranked by their average association or similarity to
a given set of stimuli. We also report on a number of experiments conducted on the shared
task data, comparing first-order models (based on co-occurrence and statistical association) to
second-order models (based on distributional similarity).

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.9999580625">
This paper describes NaDiR, a corpus-based system designed for the reverse association task. NaDiR
is an acronym for Naive Distributional Response generation. NaDiR is naive because it is based on a
very simple algorithm that operationalizes the multiword association task as a ranking problem: candi-
date words from a large vocabulary are ranked by their average statistical association or distributional
similarity to a given set of stimuli, then the highest-ranked candidate is selected as NaDiR’s response.
We compare models based on collocations (first-order models, see Evert (2008) for an overview) to
models based on distributional similarity (second-order models; see Sahlgren (2006), Turney and Pan-
tel (2010), and reference therein for a review). Previous work on this task showed that co-occurrence
models outperform distributional semantic models (henceforth, DSMs), and that using rank measures
improves performance because it accounts for directionality of the association/similarity (e.g., the asso-
ciation from stimulus to response may be larger than the association from response to stimulus). Our
results corroborate both claims.
The paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides an overview of the task and of the problems
we encountered in its implementation; section 3 summarizes related work; section 4 describes NaDiR in
detail; section 5 reports the results of our experiments on the shared task training and test data; section 6
describes ongoing and future work on NaDiR.

2 The Task and its Problems
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922125">
The shared task datasets are derived from the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (Kiss et al., 1973)1. The
Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (henceforth, EAT) contains free associations to approximately 8000
English cue words. For each cue (e.g., visual) EAT lists all associations collected in the survey (e.g., aid,
eyes, aids, see, eye, seen, sight, etc.) sorted according to the number of subjects who responded with the
respective word. The CogALex shared task on multiword association is based on the EAT dataset, and
is in fact a reverse association task (Rapp, 2014). The top five responses for a target word are provided
as stimuli (e.g., aid, eyes, aids, see, eye), and the participating systems are required to generate the
original cue as a response (e.g., visual). The training and the test sets are random extracts of 2000 EAT

items each, with minimal pre-processing (only items containing multiword units and non-alphabetical
characters were discarded).
A key problem we had to tackle while developing our system was the unrestricted set of possible re-
sponses in combination with a discrete association task, which requires the algorithm to pick exactly the
right answer out of tens of thousands of possible responses. This feature makes this task much more dif-
ficult than the multiple-choice tasks often used to evaluate distributional semantic models. The problem
is further complicated by the fact that the response may be an inflected form and only a prediction of the
exact form was accepted as a correct answer. The need for a solution to these issues motivates various
aspects of the NaDiR algorithm, described in section 4.

Previous studies based on free association norms differ considerably in terms of the type of task (regular
free association task – one stimulus, one response vs. multiword association task – many stimuli, one
response), gold standards, and key features of the evaluated models (e.g., source corpora used and choice
of a candidate vocabulary from which responses are selected).
In regular free association tasks (one stimulus, one response), responses are known to contain both
paradigmatically and syntagmatically related words. Rapp (2002) proposes to integrate first-order (co-
occurrence lists) and second-order (bag-of-words DSMs) information to distinguish syntagmatic from
paradigmatic relations by exploiting the comparison of most salient collocates and nearest neighbors.
A task derived from the EAT norms was used in the ESSLLI 2008 shared task2. Results from first-
order co-occurrence data turned out to be much better than those from second-order DSMs, in line with
the findings made by Rapp (2002) and Wettler et al. (2005).
A similar picture emerges from studies on the multiword association task. Models based on first-order
co-occurrence (collocations) outperform models based on vector similarity. This superiority, however, is
not validated via a direct comparison: results were obtained by studies with different features and goals
(see Rapp (2014) for a review; see Griffiths et al. (2007) and Smith et al. (2013) for evaluations of
models based on Latent Semantic Analysis). A specific feature of successful studies on the multiword
association task is that they introduce an element of directionality (Rapp, 2013; Rapp, 2014), which
allows a correct implementation of the directionality of the modeled effects (from stimulus to response).
Our survey of related studies motivated the choice to base NaDiR on first-order or second-order co-
occurrence statistics, and to use collocate or neighbor rank to account for directionality. Our main contri-
bution to research on the reverse association task is a systematic experimental comparison of first-order
and second-order models (using the same gold standard, same source corpus, and same candidate vocab-
ulary), which enables us to give a sound answer to the question whether first-order models are indeed
superior for multiword association tasks.

NaDiR operationalizes the multiword association task as a ranking problem. For each set of stimuli,
the possible response words (“candidates”) are ranked according to their average association strength or
distributional similarity to the stimulus words. The top-ranked candidate is selected as NaDiR’s response.
One advantage of the ranking approach is that it provides additional insights into the experimental results:
if the model prediction is not correct, the rank of the correct answer can be used as a measure how “close”
the model came to the human associations.
Since neither a fixed set of response candidates nor an indication of the source of the training and
test data were available (and we did not google for the training sets), we compiled a large vocabulary of
possible responses. We believe that restricting the vocabulary to the 8,033 cue words in the EAT would
have improved our results considerably. More details concerning the choice of the candidate vocabulary
are reported in section 4.1.

NaDiR uses either first-order or second-order co-occurrence statistics to predict the association
strength between stimuli and responses. In the first case (“collocations”), we apply one of several stan-
dard statistical association measures to co-occurrence counts obtained from a large corpus. In the second
case, association is quantified by cosine similarity in a distributional semantic model built from the same
corpus. Both first-order and second-order statistics were collected from UKWaC in order to compete in
the constrained track of the shared task.
Recent experiments (Hare et al., 2009; Lapesa and Evert, 2013; Lapesa et al., to appear) suggest
that semantic relations are often better captured by neighbour ranks rather than direct use of statistical
association measures or cosine similarity values. Therefore, NaDiR can alternatively quantify association
strength by collocate rank and similarity by neighbour rank. In our experiments (section 5), we compare
the different approaches.
NaDiR is designed for the multiword association task, and it contains additional features related to the
particular design of the CogALex shared task:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9627932">
• We reduce the number of candidates by selecting the most likely response POS with a machine-
learning algorithm (section 4.1);
• NaDiR operates on lemmatized data in order to reduce sparseness. We lemmatize stimuli using a
heuristic method (section 4.1), predict a response lemma, and then use machine-learning techniques
to generate a plausible word form (section 4.3).

4.1 Pre-processing and Vocabulary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997855333333333">
Our experiments were conducted on the UKWaC3 corpus. UKWaC contains 2 billion words, web-
crawled from the .uk domain between 2005 and 2007. The release of UKWaC also contains linguistic
annotation (pos-tagging and lemmatization) performed with Tree Tagger4.
To assign a part-of-speech tag and a lemma to every word in the dataset without relying on external
tools, we adopted the following mapping strategy based on the linguistic annotation already available in
UKWaC:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9120915">
1. We extracted all attested wordform/part of speech/lemma combinations from UKWaC, together
with their frequency;
2. Every word form in the training set was assigned to the most frequent part of speech/lemma combi-
nation attested in UKWaC.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999854333333333">
We believe that the advantages of constructing distributional models based on lemmatized words over-
come the drawbacks of this type of out-of-context lemmatization and part-of-speech assignment.
The part-of-speech information added to every word in the dataset by the mapping procedure was
used to train a classifier that, given the parts of speech of the stimuli, predicts the part of speech of the
response. We trained a support-vector machine, using the svm function from the R package e10715,
with standard settings.
The part-of-speech classifier is based on a coarse part-of-speech tagset with only five tags: N (noun),
J (adjective), V (verb), R (adverb), other (closed-class words). We considered each row of the dataset
as an observation, with the part of speech of the response as predicted value, and the part of speech of
the stimulus words as predictors. Every observation is represented as a bag of tags, i.e., a vector listing
for each of the five tags how often it occurs among the stimuli. For example, if a set of stimuli contains
3 nouns, one verb and one adjective, the corresponding bag-of-tags vector looks as follows: {N = 3; V =
1; J = 1; R = 0; other = 0}. On the training set, the part-of-speech classifier achieves an accuracy of
72%.
The vocabulary of our models only contains lemmatized open-class words (this information is avail-
able in the annotation of the corpus). By inspecting the frequencies of stimuli and response words in the
training dataset, we established a reasonable minimum frequency threshold for candidate words of 100
occurrences in UKWaC. With this threshold, only 10 response words and 16 stimulus words from the

Collocation data are compiled from UKWaC based on the vocabulary described in section 4.1. Both
nodes (rows of the co-occurrence matrix) and collocates (columns of the co-occurrence matrix) are cho-
sen from this vocabulary. Collection of first-order models involved the manipulation of a number of
parameters, briefly summarized below.
We adopted three different window sizes:

Our experiments involved a third parameter, the index of association strength, which determines al-
ternative ways of quantifying the degree of association between targets and contexts in the first-order
model. Given two words a and b represented in a first-order model, we propose two alternative ways of
quantifying the degree of association between a and b. The first option (and standard in corpus-based
modeling) is to compute the association score between a and b. The alternative choice is based on rank
among collocates. Given two words a and b, in our task stimulus and potential response, we consider:

Based on the results of a large-scale evaluation of DSM parameters (Lapesa and Evert, under review)
and the modeling of semantic priming effects (Lapesa and Evert, 2013; Lapesa et al., to appear), we
identified a robust configuration of parameters for second-order models that we decided to adopt in this
study. Second-order models involved in our experiments share the following parameter settings:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99971">
• The target words (rows) are defined by the vocabulary described in section 4.1.
• The context words (columns) are the 50,000 most frequent context words in the respective co-
occurrence matrices. The 50 most frequent words in UKWaC are discarded.
• Co-occurrence vectors are scored with a sparse version of simple-log likelihood, in which negative
values clamped to zero in order to preserve the sparseness of the co-occurrence matrix. Scored
vectors are rescaled by applying a logarithmic transformation.
• We reduce the scored co-occurrence matrix to 1000 latent dimensions using randomized SVD
(Halko et al., 2009).
• We adopt cosine distance (i.e. the angle between vectors) as a distance metric for the computation
of vector similarity.

Our experiments on second-order models involved the manipulation of two parameters: window size
and index of association strength.
The size of the context window quantifies the amount of shared context involved in the computation of
similarity. We expect the manipulation of window size to be crucial in determining model performance,
as different context windows will enable the model to capture different types of relations between re-
sponse and stimulus words (Sahlgren, 2006; Lapesa et al., to appear). In our experiments with NaDiR,
we adopted three different window sizes:

<listItem confidence="0.999137">

<bodyText confidence="0.999749571428571">
The values for index of association strength are the same as for the first-order models, computing ranks
among the nearest neighbors of the stimulus or response word. The use of rank-based measures is of
particular interest, because: (i) it allows us to model directionality (while, for example, cosine distance is
symmetric); (ii) it already proved successful in modeling behavioral data (Hare et al., 2009; Lapesa and
Evert, 2013); (iii) since the vocabulary of first-order and second-order models are identical, rank-based
measures allow a direct comparison between the two classes of models, as well as experiments based on
their combination.

4.3 Response Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997834">
To generate a response for a set of stimuli in the training/test dataset, we apply the following procedure:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.966710692307692">
1. For each set of stimuli, we compute association strengths or similarities between each stimulus and
each response candidate, adopting one of the measures described in section 4.2.
2. From the set of potential responses, we select the words whose POS agrees with the predictions of
the classifier described in section 4.1. Stimulus words are discarded from the potential answers.
3. We compute the average association strength or similarity across all five stimuli; if a stimulus does
not appear in the model, it is simply omitted from the average.
4. The top-ranked candidate is the POS-disambiguated lemma suggested as a response by NaDiR.
5. We generate a suitable word form by inverting the heuristic lemmatization; if the full Penn tag (e.g.,
NNS: noun, common, plural; NN: noun, common, singular or mass, etc.) of the response is known,
this step can be implemented as a deterministic lookup (since a word form is usually determined
uniquely by lemma and Penn tag). We therefore trained a second SVM classifier that predicts the
full Penn tag of the response based on the full tags of the stimuli. On the training set, this part-of-
speech classifier reaches an accuracy of 68%.

Tables 2 to 5 display the results of our experiments on the training data, separately for first-order (tables
2-4) and second-order models (table 5). Parameter configurations are reported in the Parameter column8.
The number of correct responses in the lemmatized version is reported in the column Lemma (showing
how often our system predicted the correct lemma). The column Wordform reports the number of correct
responses for which, before inverting the lemmatization, the inflected form was already identical to the
lemma. As the task of predicting exactly one word is particularly difficult, we further characterize the
performance of our evaluated models by reporting the number of cases in which the correct answer from
the training set was among the first 10 (&lt; 10), 50 (&lt; 50), or 100 (&lt; 100) ranked candidates. In the last
column, we report the average rank of the correct responses (Avg correct).
The results reported in tables 2 to 5 allowed us to identify best parameter configurations for the first-
order (symmetric 2 words window, frequency, backward rank) and second-order models (2 words win-
dow, distance). We evaluated these configurations on the test data (table 6). Table 7 compares the
performance of the best first-order and the best second-order model on the training and test datasets,
both for lemmatized response (Training-Lemma, Test-Lemma) and generation of the correct word form
(Training-Inflected, Test-Inflected).
A considerable portion of the experiments reported in this paper were conducted after the submission
deadline of the CogALex shared task. As a consequence, our submitted results do not correspond to the
best overall configuration found in the evaluation study. The submission was based on a second order
model, a 4-word window, and cosine distance as index of distributional similarity. In this configuration,
NaDiR generated 262 correct responses, corresponding to an accuracy of 13%.

5.1 Discussion
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999618363636364">
The results of our experiments are in line with the tendencies identified in the literature (see section
3). First-order models based on direct co-occurrence (high scores are assigned to words that co-occur),
outperform second-order models based on distributional similarity (smaller distances between words that
occur in similar contexts).
For the first-order models, the best index of association strength is backward rank (the rank of the
stimulus among the collocates of the potential response), fully congruent with the experimental setting
(in the EAT norm, subjects produced the stimuli as free associations of the expected response). Surpris-
ingly, frequency outperforms simple-log likelihood (which is usually considered to be among the best
association measures for the identification of collocations). In line with the results achieved by Rapp
(2014), a symmetric window of 2 words to the left and to the right of the target achieves best results.
For the second-order models, the smallest context window (2 words) achieves the best performance.

Considering the good results from collocation-based models, we would have expected a better perfor-

significant difference between first-order and second-order models is the fact that neighbor rank works
less well than the distance between vectors, while collocate rank outperformed the association scores.

The observation for second-order models contrasts with previous work showing that rank consistently
outperforms distance in modeling priming effects (Lapesa and Evert, 2013; Lapesa et al., to appear) and
also in standard tasks such as prediction of similarity ratings and noun clustering (Lapesa and Evert, un-
der review). Among the standard tasks, the only case in which the use of neighbor rank did not produce
significant improvements with respect to vector distance was the TOEFL multiple-choice synonymy task.
Despite clear differences, the TOEFL task and the reverse association task share the property that they
involve multiple stimuli. The results presented in this paper, together with those achieved on the TOEFL
task, seem to suggest that a better strategy for the use of neighbor rank needs to be developed when
multiple stimuli are involved.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996325">
The results of the evaluation reported in this paper confirmed the tendencies identified in previous studies:
first-order models, based on direct co-occurrence, outperform second-order models, based on distribu-
tional similarity. We consider the experimental results described in this paper as a first exploration into
the dynamics of the reverse association task, and we believe that our systematic evaluation of first- and
second-order models represents a good starting point for future work, which targets improvements of
NaDiR at many levels.
The first point of improvement concerns the size of the vocabulary. We aim at finding a more op-
timal cutoff on the training data, for example by implementing a frequency bias similar to Wettler et
al. (2005). We are confident that NaDiR will significantly benefit from a smaller range of potential
responses (compared to the 155,811 lemmatized candidate words in the current version).
We are also conducting experiments using log ranks instead of plain ranks: since we compute an arith-
metic mean of the rank values, a single very high rank (from a poorly matched stimulus) will dominate
the average. We therefore assume that log ranks will improve results and make NaDiR’s responses more
robust.
An interesting research direction targets the integration of first- and second-order statistics in the pro-
cess of response generation. The evaluation results reported in this paper revealed that a very small
context window achieves the best performance for second-order models: as widely acknowledged in the
literature (Sahlgren, 2006; Lapesa et al., to appear), smaller context windows highlight paradigmatic
relations. First-order models, on the other hand, highlight syntagmatic relations (Rapp, 2002). The best
second-order and first-order models from the evaluation reported in this paper are likely to focus on dif-
ferent types of relations between response and stimulus words: this leads us to believe that an integration
of the two sources may produce improvements in NaDiR’s performance.
At a general level, we plan to make more elaborate use of the training data. In the experiments
presented in this paper, training data were used to set a frequency threshold for potential responses, train
the part-of-speech classifiers, and find the best configuration for first- and second-order models.
A possible new application of NaDiR is the modeling of datasets containing semantic norms or concept
properties, such as the McRae norms (McRae et al., 2005) or BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011). Those
datasets are standard in DSM evaluation, and their modeling can be implemented in terms of a reverse

association task, with the additional advantage that the relations between concepts and properties in those
datasets are labelled with property types for the McRae norms (e.g., encyclopedic, taxonomic, situated)
or semantic relations (e.g., hypernymy, meronymy, event-related) for BLESS. This allows a specific
evaluation for each property type or semantic relation, which will in turn give new insights into the
semantic knowledge encoded in the different corpus-based representations (first order vs. second order
vs. hybrid) and how model parameters affect these representations (e.g., window size in the comparison
of syntagmatic vs. paradigmatic relations).

NaDiR is an acronym for Naive Distributional Response generation. NaDiR is naive because it is based on a very simple algorithm that operationalizes the multiword association task as a ranking problem: candidate words from a large vocabulary are ranked by their average statistical association or distributional similarity to a given set of stimuli, then the highest-ranked candidate is selected as NaDiR’s response. We compare models based on collocations (first-order models, see Evert (2008) for an overview) to models based on distributional similarity (second-order models; see Sahlgren (2006), Turney and Pantel (2010), and reference therein for a review). Previous work on this task showed that co-occurrence models outperform distributional semantic models (henceforth, DSMs), and that using rank measures improves performance because it accounts for directionality of the association/similarity (e.g., the association from stimulus to response may be larger than the association from response to stimulus). Our results corroborate both claims. The paper is structured as follows: secti</context>

Results from firstorder co-occurrence data turned out to be much better than those from second-order DSMs, in line with the findings made by Rapp (2002) and Wettler et al. (2005). A similar picture emerges from studies on the multiword association task. Models based on first-order co-occurrence (collocations) outperform models based on vector similarity. This superiority, however, is not validated via a direct comparison: results were obtained by studies with different features and goals (see Rapp (2014) for a review; see Griffiths et al. (2007) and Smith et al. (2013) for evaluations of models based on Latent Semantic Analysis). A specific feature of successful studies on the multiword association task is that they introduce an element of directionality (Rapp, 2013; Rapp, 2014), which allows a correct implementation of the directionality of the modeled effects (from stimulus to response). Our survey of related studies motivated the choice to base NaDiR on first-order or second-order cooccurrence statistics, and to use collocate or neighbor rank to account for directionality.

In the first case (“collocations”), we apply one of several standard statistical association measures to co-occurrence counts obtained from a large corpus. In the second case, association is quantified by cosine similarity in a distributional semantic model built from the same corpus. Both first-order and second-order statistics were collected from UKWaC in order to compete in the constrained track of the shared task. Recent experiments (Hare et al., 2009; Lapesa and Evert, 2013; Lapesa et al., to appear) suggest that semantic relations are often better captured by neighbour ranks rather than direct use of statistical association measures or cosine similarity values. Therefore, NaDiR can alternatively quantify association strength by collocate rank and similarity by neighbour rank. In our experiments (section 5), we compare the different approaches. NaDiR is designed for the multiword association task, and it contains additional features related to the particular design of the CogALex shared task: • We reduce the number of candidates by select</context>

The values for index of association strength are the same as for the first-order models, computing ranks among the nearest neighbors of the stimulus or response word. The use of rank-based measures is of particular interest, because: (i) it allows us to model directionality (while, for example, cosine distance is symmetric); (ii) it already proved successful in modeling behavioral data (Hare et al., 2009; Lapesa and Evert, 2013); (iii) since the vocabulary of first-order and second-order models are identical, rank-based measures allow a direct comparison between the two classes of models, as well as experiments based on their combination. 4.3 Response Generation To generate a response for a set of stimuli in the training/test dataset, we apply the following procedure: 1. For each set of stimuli, we compute association strengths or similarities between each stimulus and each response candidate, adopting one of the measures described in section 4.2. 2.

For each cue (e.g., visual) EAT lists all associations collected in the survey (e.g., aid, eyes, aids, see, eye, seen, sight, etc.) sorted according to the number of subjects who responded with the respective word. The CogALex shared task on multiword association is based on the EAT dataset, and is in fact a reverse association task (Rapp, 2014).

<context position="8666" citStr="Lapesa and Evert, 2013" startWordPosition="1276" endWordPosition="1279"> NaDiR uses either first-order or second-order co-occurrence statistics to predict the association strength between stimuli and responses. In the first case (“collocations”), we apply one of several standard statistical association measures to co-occurrence counts obtained from a large corpus. In the second case, association is quantified by cosine similarity in a distributional semantic model built from the same corpus. Both first-order and second-order statistics were collected from UKWaC in order to compete in the constrained track of the shared task. Recent experiments (Hare et al., 2009; Lapesa and Evert, 2013; Lapesa et al., to appear) suggest that semantic relations are often better captured by neighbour ranks rather than direct use of statistical association measures or cosine similarity values. Therefore, NaDiR can alternatively quantify association strength by collocate rank and similarity by neighbour rank. In our experiments (section 5), we compare the different approaches. NaDiR is designed for the multiword association task, and it contains additional features related to the particular design of the CogALex shared task: • We reduce the number of candidates by selecting the most likely resp</context>

The alternative choice is based on rank among collocates. Given two words a and b, in our task stimulus and potential response, we consider: • forward rank: the rank of the potential response among the collocates of the stimulus; • backward rank: the rank of the stimulus among the collocates of the potential response; • average rank: the average of forward and backward rank. Second-order Models Based on the results of a large-scale evaluation of DSM parameters (Lapesa and Evert, under review) and the modeling of semantic priming effects (Lapesa and Evert, 2013; Lapesa et al., to appear), we identified a robust configuration of parameters for second-order models that we decided to adopt in this study. Second-order models involved in our experiments share the following parameter settings: • The target words (rows) are defined by the vocabulary described in section 4.1. • The context words (columns) are the 50,000 most frequent context words in the respective cooccurrence matrices. The 50 most frequent words in UKWaC are discarded. • Co-occurrence vectors are scored with a sparse version of simple-log likelihood, in which negative values clamped to ze</context>

The values for index of association strength are the same as for the first-order models, computing ranks among the nearest neighbors of the stimulus or response word. The use of rank-based measures is of particular interest, because: (i) it allows us to model directionality (while, for example, cosine distance is symmetric); (ii) it already proved successful in modeling behavioral data (Hare et al., 2009; Lapesa and Evert, 2013); (iii) since the vocabulary of first-order and second-order models are identical, rank-based measures allow a direct comparison between the two classes of models, as well as experiments based on their combination. 4.3 Response Generation To generate a response for a set of stimuli in the training/test dataset, we apply the following procedure: 1. For each set of stimuli, we compute association strengths or similarities between each stimulus and each response candidate, adopting one of the measures described in section 4.2. 2. From the set of potential responses, we select the words whose POS </context>

Among the standard tasks, the only case in which the use of neighbor rank did not produce significant improvements with respect to vector distance was the TOEFL multiple-choice synonymy task. Despite clear differences, the TOEFL task and the reverse association task share the property that they involve multiple stimuli. The results presented in this paper, together with those achieved on the TOEFL task, seem to suggest that a better strategy for </context>

In the experiments presented in this paper, training data were used to set a frequency threshold for potential responses, train the part-of-speech classifiers, and find the best configuration for first- and second-order models. A possible new application of NaDiR is the modeling of datasets containing semantic norms or concept properties, such as the McRae norms (McRae et al., 2005) or BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011). Those datasets are standard in DSM evaluation, and their modeling can be implemented in terms of a reverse 57 association task, with the additional advantage that the relations between concepts and properties in those datasets are labelled with property types for the McRae norms (e.g., encyclopedic, taxonomic, situated) or semantic relations (e.g., hypernymy, meronymy, event-related) for BLESS. This allows a specific evaluation for each property type or semantic relation, which will in turn give new insights into the semantic knowledge encoded in the differe</context>

In regular free association tasks (one stimulus, one response), responses are known to contain both paradigmatically and syntagmatically related words. Rapp (2002) proposes to integrate first-order (cooccurrence lists) and second-order (bag-of-words DSMs) information to distinguish syntagmatic from paradigmatic relations by exploiting the comparison of most salient collocates and nearest neighbors. A task derived from the EAT norms was used in the ESSLLI 2008 shared task2. Results from firstorder co-occurrence data turned out to be much better than those from second-order DSMs, in line with the findings made by Rapp (2002) and Wettler et al. (2005).

An interesting research direction targets the integration of first- and second-order statistics in the process of response generation. The evaluation results reported in this paper revealed that a very small context window achieves the best performance for second-order models: as widely acknowledged in the literature (Sahlgren, 2006; Lapesa et al., to appear), smaller context windows highlight paradigmatic relations. First-order models, on the other hand, highlight syntagmatic relations (Rapp, 2002). The best second-order and first-order models from the evaluation reported in this paper are likely to focus on different types of relations between response and stimulus words: this leads us to believe that an integration of the two sources may produce improvements in NaDiR’s performance.

The Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (henceforth, EAT) contains free associations to approximately 8000 English cue words. For each cue (e.g., visual) EAT lists all associations collected in the survey (e.g., aid, eyes, aids, see, eye, seen, sight, etc.) sorted according to the number of subjects who responded with the respective word. The CogALex shared task on multiword association is based on the EAT dataset, and is in fact a reverse association task (Rapp, 2014). The top five responses for a target word are provided as stimuli (e.g., aid, eyes, aids, see, eye), and the participating systems are required to generate the original cue as a response (e.g., visual).

For the first-order models, the best index of association strength is backward rank (the rank of the stimulus among the collocates of the potential response), fully congruent with the experimental setting (in the EAT norm, subjects produced the stimuli as free associations of the expected response). Surprisingly, frequency outperforms simple-log likelihood (which is usually considered to be among the best association measures for the identification of collocations). In line with the results achieved by Rapp (2014), a symmetric window of 2 words to the left and to the right of the target achieves best results.

NaDiR is naive because it is based on a very simple algorithm that operationalizes the multiword association task as a ranking problem: candidate words from a large vocabulary are ranked by their average statistical association or distributional similarity to a given set of stimuli, then the highest-ranked candidate is selected as NaDiR’s response. We compare models based on collocations (first-order models, see Evert (2008) for an overview) to models based on distributional similarity (second-order models; see Sahlgren (2006), Turney and Pantel (2010), and reference therein for a review).

The size of the context window quantifies the amount of shared context involved in the computation of similarity. We expect the manipulation of window size to be crucial in determining model performance, as different context windows will enable the model to capture different types of relations between response and stimulus words (Sahlgren, 2006; Lapesa et al., to appear). In our experiments with NaDiR, we adopted three different window sizes: • symmetric window, 2 words to the left and to the right of the target; • symmetric window, 4 words to the left and to the right of the target; • symmetric window, 16 words to the left and to the right of the target.

The first point of improvement concerns the size of the vocabulary. We aim at finding a more optimal cutoff on the training data, for example by implementing a frequency bias similar to Wettler et al. (2005). We are confident that NaDiR will significantly benefit from a smaller range of potential responses (compared to the 155,811 lemmatized candidate words in the current version).

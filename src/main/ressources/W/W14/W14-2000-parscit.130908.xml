The papers in these proceedings were presented at the 5th annual workshop on Cognitive Modeling and
Computational Linguistics (CMCL), held in Baltimore, Maryland on June 26th, 2014. CMCL-2014
followed in the tradition of earlier CMCL meetings, providing a venue for research in mathematical and
computational psycholinguistics. We solicited papers on a broad spectrum of topics which spanned the
formal modeling of language representation, development, and processing, and were very pleased to
receive 17 submissions this year. The program below includes 8 of these papers which were selected
for final presentation at the workshop. We would like to thank all submitting authors for the quality
and variety of the papers we received, and for helping to foster the growth of the field of computational
psycholinguistics. We would also like to thank our program committee for providing expertise in the
evaluation of submitted papers. Finally, our program this year includes invited talks by Dr. Naomi
Feldman of the University of Maryland and Dr. Edward Gibson of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. We extend our appreciation to these researchers for sharing their work with us.

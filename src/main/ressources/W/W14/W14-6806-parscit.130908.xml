<bodyText confidence="0.999529647058824">
In this paper we present a conversational
dialogue system, Ch2R (Chinese Chatter
Robot) for online shopping guide, which
allows users to inquire about information
of mobile phone in Chinese. The purpose
of this paper is to describe our develop-
ment effort in terms of the underlying hu-
man language technologies (HLTs) as
well as other system issues. We focus on a
mixed-initiative conversation mechanism
for interactive shopping guide combining
initiative guiding and question under-
standing. We also present some evalua-
tion on the system in mobile phone shop-
ping guide domain. Evaluation results
demonstrate the efficiency of our ap-
proach.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956389830509">
Spoken dialogue systems are presently available
for many purposes, such as, Airline Travel In-
formation System (ATIS) project in the early
1990s (Price, 1990), customer service (Gorin et
al., 1997), weather inquiry system (Zue et al.,
2000), campus navigation system (Zhang et al.,
2004), bus schedules and route guidance (Raux
et al., 2003), stock information inquiry (Huang et
al., 2004), restaurant recommendation system
(Liu, et al., 2008), drug review system (Liu and
Seneff, 2011), and spoken route instruction
(Pappu and Rudnicky, 2012). These systems
have been well developed for laboratory research,
and some have become commercially viable.
The next generation of intelligent dialogue
systems is expected to go beyond factoid ques-
tion answering and straightforward task fulfill-
ment, by providing active assistance and subjec-
tive recommendations, thus behaving more like
human agents (Liu et al., 2010). For example, in
the scenario that we envision, on online e-
commerce site, an intelligent dialogue system
which roles play a conversational shopping guide
may suggest which digital camera is a better
choice, considering brand, price, pixel, etc.; or
suggest which mobile phone is the most popular
among teenagers or highest rated by users.
In this paper, we describe our development ef-
fort on a Chinese chatter robot, named Ch2R
(Chinese Chatter Robot) for shopping guide
with both intelligent ability and professional
knowledge. The challenges of developing such a
information guiding dialogue system in Chinese
includes: 1) how to provide active assistance and
subjective recommendations; 2) how to deal with
the diversity and flexibility of Chinese language
in question understanding; 3) how to ensure the
system with great adaptability which can be easi-
ly applied to be a shopping guide in a certain
new specialized field.
To tackle the first problem, we propose a
mixed-initiative framework. The proposed
framework is able to take initiative to obtain us-
ers&apos; need, perform passive analysis and under-
standing of users&apos; questions, and switch between
the two modes self-adaptively.
Our solution to the second challenge is to
analysis Chinese questions by combining gram-
mar and semantic (Huang et al., 2014). First,
hand-crafted sentence compression grammar ba-
ses including grammar rules and question type
patterns are added to the robot. By sentence
compression, the diversity and flexibility of Chi-
nese utterances can be recognized and catego-
rized into limited sentence structures. Then, a
question understanding method is proposed by
combining grammar based question type pattern
recognition and semantic based information ex-
traction and organization.

<bodyText confidence="0.999899416666666">
Finally, we address the last problem by using
the design concept of building professional
knowledge based on intelligent ability, which
combines a variety of human language technolo-
gies and intelligent technologies. Such design
enables Ch2R with great adaptability, making it
easily applied to the shopping guide in a new
restricted domain, by adding the semantic
knowledge and the detailed commodity infor-
mation of that specialized field.
An example scenario of Ch2R in mobile
phone domain is shown in Figure 1.

The purpose of this paper is to describe our
development effort, and to present some evalua-
tion results on the system. The remainder of this
paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
the detail framework of Ch2R. The implementa-
tion of the mixed-initiative conversation mecha-
nism combining intelligent guiding and under-
standing within the architecture of our shopping
guide robot is proposed in Section 3. The profes-
sional knowledge kept by the robot is briefly
presented in Section 4. Section 5 shows the
preliminary evaluation results of Ch2R in mobile

concludes by outlining future developments and
possible applications in Section 6.

<bodyText confidence="0.998880188679246">
Figure 2 shows the system framework of Ch2R.
In the sentence preprocessing component,
Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech
tagging are processed by ICTCLAS (Zhang et al.,
2003). Wrongly written characters, internet
language, nickname of a product, etc. , are also
dealt with in this step.
Then, two main parts enclosed by bold dotted
lines denote the initiative guiding (branch ①, e.g.
line (3), (5) and (7) in Figure 1) and the passive
understanding (branch ②, e.g. line (8), (12), and
(14) in Figure 1) modes, remaining the situation
when no valid information exists after the pro-
cess of information extraction component
(branch ③, e.g. line (2), (10), and (16) in Figure
1). In that case, AIML process, a process based
on the Artificial Intelligence Markup Language
(AIML) (Wallace, 2003) is used to handle some
simple conversations beyond domain knowledge,
some cases potentially to switch to initiative
guiding and the state of end. The out of domain
utterance processing based on AIML will be dis-
cussed in detail later in a separate paper.
In the information extraction component, se-
mantic information is extracted from the source
utterance by using with the semantic base. The
extracted semantic information is converted into
well organized semantic knowledge in
knowledge organization component.
For interrogative sentence, i.e. a user question,
we use the hand-crafted sentence compression
grammar rules to perform sentence compression
and employed question type patterns in question
structure recognition component, matching the
only one question type pattern taking along with
information for semantic organization and an-
swering for any input question (Huang et al.,
2014).
The Ch2R architecture embodies the combina-
tion of intelligent ability and professional
knowledge. From the intelligent perspective, sen-
tence compression and question structure recog-
nition components show the ability to understand
and analyze questions, live-table stands for the
ability to memorize, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) to update the sequence of the attributes in
live-table embodies the ability of self-learning,
and Case Based Reasoning (CBR) of AIML pro-
cess provides the capacity for logical reasoning.
From the professional perspective, info-table
provides detailed commodity information of a
certain specialized field. The semantic
knowledge of that field is stored in semantic base.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.996679">
3.1 Initiative Guiding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988980347826087">
One of the major benefits of Ch2R is that it can
provide initiative guiding. We first introduce the
live-table, and then briefly propose the guiding
and recommendation mechanism based on live-
table.
Live-table: the Ability to Memorize
Live-table is the message storage that acts as the
memory of Ch2R. The information of live-table
is live in the sense that it is active during the
whole process of shopping guide. There are three
kinds of active information in live-table, includ-
ing the attribute values, the context of the dia-
logue, and the recommendation list. The meaning
representation of Ch2R is similar to other frame-
based dialogue system, in which frame had pre-
defined slots that were appropriate for task. Un-
derstanding in these systems amounted to ex-
tracting specific fillers for each slot (e.g. Brand).
Figure 3 shows the update process of live-table
according to the example dialogue in mobile
phone shopping guide from Figure 3 (a).
In our current design, we only keep the last
sentences of both chatbot and user to support

answering. The long-term memory is kept by the
attribute values in live-table. So, live-table is the
basis when Ch2R checks the candidate mobile
phones in Information inquiry component.

Guiding and Recommendation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999384">
Effective guiding is achieved by looking up the
unconfirmed attributes in the live-table to present
a question. It is worthwhile to note that the se-
quence of the attributes in live-table is variable,
which means the priority of the attributes used in
initiative guiding can be changed for users’ pref-
erence in shopping. A process of Reinforcement
Learning (RL) (Kaebling et al., 1996) is used to
achieve such flexibility, according to the analysis
of the users’ questions collected in passive un-
derstanding mode.
Ch2R would confirm every attribute, however,
this would lead to too many times of interactions
with user, and it looks a little mechanical. We
address this problem by offering a recommenda-
tion in the initiative guiding process once there
are only limited numbers of candidates, e.g. 1, 2
or 3 candidates. Such recommendation limits the
interactions and can embody the profession of
Ch2R in shopping guide.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998592">
3.2 Passive Understanding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990428571429">
We now turn to the passive understanding mode.
The word passive means that when face to a us-
er’s question, the chatbot has to analyze and an-
swer. Actually, we can simply observed that
human being, even a three-year-old child can
understand many sentences with different
structures and make different responses
according to different structure of the questions.
It reveals that learning and recognition of
sentence type structure is the foundation of the
ability to understand and analyze questions. Af-
ter mastering the grammar sentence type
structure, once learning semantic knowledge of a
certain domain, one can then dialogue in that
specialized field.
Therefore, first, hand-crafted grammar bases
in Chinese including grammar rules for sentence
compression and question type patterns for ques-
tion structure recognition are added to the shop-
ping guide robot, which act as the “language ac-
quisition device” suggested by Chomsky (2005).
And then we simplify a complex sentence leav-
ing only the structure by sentence compression
based on grammar rules. Finally, we employed
question type patterns for question structure
recognition, matching the only one question type
pattern for any input question (Huang et al.,
2014).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.838477">
Sentence Compression
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99868805882353">
For all kinds of languages, sentences are diversi-
fied and innumerable, but the sentence structures
are limited. By sentence compression, the diver-
sity of user inputs can be recognized and catego-
rized into limited sentence structures, i.e. ques-
tion type pattern. Given an input source sentence
of words x = x„ X2, ... x„ , a target compression y is
formed by removing any subset of these words
(Knight and Marcu, 2002). The aim of the sen-
tence compression in our system is to produce a
summary of a single sentence that retains the
most important structure information while re-
maining grammatical.
Tree based representation is used in sentence
compression. The Stanford Chinese Parser 1
(Levy and Manning, 2003) is employed for the
tree-based parsing. In order to get a correct syn-

tax tree from Stanford Parser, we have to formal-
ize the sentence because Stanford Parse can’t
understand some sentence structures. Then, we
use the hand-crafted sentence compression rules,
and rely on recent work in text-to-text generation
methods (Cohn and Lapata, 2009; Cohn and
Lapata, 2013) to perform sentence compression.
Hand-crafted grammar rules for sentence
compression are obtained by analyzing hundreds
of question examples with different sentence
structures. Because our system use tree based
representation in sentence compression, the
grammar rules take the forms like (NP (DNP,
NP1))-&gt;NP(NP1), which states that a NP consist-
ing of a DNP and another NP, denoted as NP1,
can be rewritten as NP just consisting of NP1
(without the DNP). Taking a wh-question ques-
tion, “在你们店有什么 2000 块以下的手机?
(Which mobile phones are less than 2000 RMB
in your store?)”, as example, the sentence com-
pression result is “有什么手机?(Which mobile
phones?)”. Figure 4 illustrates such example
based on the hand-crafted grammar rules base
used in our system.

Question Type Pattern Recognition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999369867924528">
Question type pattern recognition is important
for the later steps in information organization
and answering. However, building an effective
knowledge base of question type patterns is a
challenge, especially in Chinese language, which
is unlike English, in which question word can
basically represents the classification of the inter-
rogative. We design a 4-set question type pattern
as {interrogative sentence type, interrogative
word type, interrogative phrases, sentence struc-
ture}. Taking the compressed sentence, “有什么
手机?(Which mobile phones?)”, as example, its
question type pattern is “(特指问,什么,什么/
哪*,VP+~+NP) (wh-questions, which, which,
VP +—+NP )”, where — stand for the interroga-
tive phrase. Other questions, such as “有哪些手
机?(Which mobile phones?)” and “有哪款手
机? (Which mobile phones?)” will be recog-
nized as this question type pattern. Notice that a
more complex question, such as “有什么 2000
块 以 下 的 大 屏 幕 的 手 机 ? (Which mobile
phones are less than 2000 RMB and with big
screen?)” and an informal user input, such as “有
什么 2000 块左右的?(Which are about 2000
RMB?)”, will be also recognized as the same
question type pattern after sentence compression
and question type pattern recognition, which
shows good robustness of our design. It also
leads to good performance with limited question
type patterns (30 question type patterns in our
current dialogue system) (Huang et al., 2014).
The procedure of question type pattern recog-
nition is shown in Figure 5.
Due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word seg-
mentation in Stanford Parser, to raise the match-
ing rate, we remark the word tags by employing
a more satisfied word segmentation interface in
the first step of question type pattern recognition.
Given a compressed interrogative sentence, IC-
TCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003) is introduced to re-
mark the word tags and get the syntax sequence.
In the 4-set question type pattern, the interrog-
ative word type is not used as recognition factor.
The similarities of interrogative sentence type,
the interrogative phrases and the sentence struc-
ture are taken as the three factors for computing
the similarity between the compressed interroga-
tive sentence and any question type pattern in
question type patterns base.
Figure 6 shows how to calculate the similarity
between the source syntax sequence and the tar-
get syntax sequence, i.e. the sentence structure in
a certain question type pattern.

Semantic base is used for semantic infor-
mation extraction. Taking the source sentence of
“有什么2000块以下的大屏幕的手机?(Which
mobile phones are less than 2000 RMB and with
big screen?)” as example, the extracted semantic
information is “ 价 格 : 2000 块 , 以 下 ; 主 屏 尺
寸 : 屏 幕 , 大 (Price: 2000 RMB, less than;
Screen_size: screen, big)”. Then, the extract-
ed semantic information is converted into well
organized semantic knowledge based on the cor-
responding question type pattern. The extract-
ed semantic information in the above example is
organized as “ ‘价格: 2000块,以下’and ‘主屏尺
寸: 屏幕,大’ (‘Price: 2000 RMB, less than’ and
‘Screen_size: screen, big’)”. Generally,
knowledge organization of the ques-
tion type patterns with the same interrogative
sentence type will be the same or at less similar.

We performed a preliminary system evaluation
by logging the interactions of 6 subjects with the
system. Each evaluator tests 3 times, i.e. total 18
dialogues. All of the evaluators were familiar
with the Ch2R system capabilities, but did not
have a detailed knowledge of how to constitute a
correct reference answer.
The overall statistical results are shown in Ta-

As we can see from Table 3, large gaps be-
tween the maximum and the minimum turns of
both branch ① and ② show the diversity of the
evaluators. Some of them like to ask questions,
while some others enjoy system-initiative.
The results for the initiative guiding mode are
given in Table 4. Our system provided successful
active guiding for 100 of the 105 turns of initia-
tive guiding, and made only 5 cases of failed
guiding. One of the errors was due to the change
of user intent, i.e., the intent of user was changed
but the system failed to catch such change and
update the live-table. The other four errors that
the system made were due to the imperfection of
the current semantic base, which resulted in in-
correctly extracting attribute values in utterances,
and thus affected the later guiding.
The results for question understanding are
given in Table 5. There are total 96 user ques-
tions in the test, 3 of which incorrectly enter the
out of domain utterance processing branch due to
the imperfection of the semantic base. In 93 user
questions that entering branch ②, 90.3% were
correctly understudied (both correctly semantic
information extraction and question type pattern
recognition), including some utterances with typ-
ing mistakes or ellipsis. We also found that the
93 user questions are only distributed within 12
different question type patterns. That means of
the total 30 question type patterns in current sys-
tem, 18 did not exist in the test. This is mainly
because most of the questions in the test are wh-
questions and yes-no questions. In 9 incorrectly
cases, most of them were due to the inaccuracy
brought by part-of-speech tagging and the imper-
fection of the current semantic base. Only 2 er-
rors were due to factors related to the design of
the question type patterns.
The results for out of domain utterance pro-
cessing are given in Table 6. Of the 5 sentences
that provided incorrect answers, 4 were also due
to the imperfection of the semantic base, and
thus incorrectly leading the dialogue process en-
tering out of domain utterance processing branch.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987074074074">
This paper presents the development and prelim-
inary evaluation of a Chinese conversational dia-
logue system named Ch2R with intelligent abil-
ity and professional knowledge for online shop-
ping guide. As we can see from the evaluation
results, it can perform well in the mobile phone
shopping guide in all kinds of situations includ-
ing initiative guiding, passive understanding, and
out of domain utterance processing. Although
still in its primary stage, by combining a variety
of human language technologies and intelligent
technologies into an integrated framework, it can
dialogue like a human being and provide a pro-
fessional service. Moreover, the design concept
of building professional knowledge based on
intelligent ability ensures Ch2R with great adapt-
ability. We can easily apply it to the shopping
guide of other specialized fields.
There are many possible and promising re-
search directions for the near future. We are im-
plementing new and funny interaction, such as
communicate in voice using WeChat. Moreover,
a separate component of dialogue management
with explicit dialogue model will be added to the
system. In addition, we also want to experiment
with a larger number and various types of users
which will make Ch2R more robust.

To tackle the first problem, we propose a mixed-initiative framework. The proposed framework is able to take initiative to obtain users&apos; need, perform passive analysis and understanding of users&apos; questions, and switch between the two modes self-adaptively. Our solution to the second challenge is to analysis Chinese questions by combining grammar and semantic (Huang et al., 2014). First, hand-crafted sentence compression grammar bases including grammar rules and question type patterns are added to the robot. By sentence compression, the diversity and flexibility of Chinese utterances can be recognized and categorized into limited sentence structures. Then, a question understanding method is proposed by combining grammar based question type pattern recognition and semantic based information extraction and organization. 26 Proceedings of the Third CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing, pages 26–34, Wuhan, China, 20-21 October 2014 Finally, we addre</context>

The extracted semantic information is converted into well organized semantic knowledge in knowledge organization component. For interrogative sentence, i.e. a user question, we use the hand-crafted sentence compression grammar rules to perform sentence compression and employed question type patterns in question structure recognition component, matching the only one question type pattern taking along with information for semantic organization and answering for any input question (Huang et al., 2014). The Ch2R architecture embodies the combination of intelligent ability and professional knowledge. From the intelligent perspective, sentence compression and question structure recognition components show the ability to understand and analyze questions, live-table stands for the ability to memorize, Reinforcement Learning (RL) to update the sequence of the attributes in live-table embodies the ability of self-learning, and Case Based Reasoning (CBR) of AIML process provides the capacity for logical reasoning.

Sentence Compression For all kinds of languages, sentences are diversified and innumerable, but the sentence structures are limited. By sentence compression, the diversity of user inputs can be recognized and categorized into limited sentence structures, i.e. question type pattern. Given an input source sentence of words x = x„ X2, ... x„ , a target compression y is formed by removing any subset of these words (Knight and Marcu, 2002). The aim of the sentence compression in our system is to produce a summary of a single sentence that retains the most important structure information while rem</context>
<context position="16637" citStr="Huang et al., 2014" startWordPosition="2573" endWordPosition="2576">机? (Which mobile phones?)” will be recognized as this question type pattern. Notice that a more complex question, such as “有什么 2000 块 以 下 的 大 屏 幕 的 手 机 ? (Which mobile phones are less than 2000 RMB and with big screen?)” and an informal user input, such as “有 什么 2000 块左右的?(Which are about 2000 RMB?)”, will be also recognized as the same question type pattern after sentence compression and question type pattern recognition, which shows good robustness of our design. It also leads to good performance with limited question type patterns (30 question type patterns in our current dialogue system) (Huang et al., 2014). The procedure of question type pattern recognition is shown in Figure 5. Due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation in Stanford Parser, to raise the matching rate, we remark the word tags by employing a more satisfied word segmentation interface in the first step of question type pattern recognition. Given a compressed interrogative sentence, ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003) is introduced to remark the word tags and get the syntax sequence. In the 4-set question type pattern, the interrogative word type is not used as recognition factor. The similarities of interrogative sentence type, t</context>

Example of the update process of live-table. Guiding and Recommendation Effective guiding is achieved by looking up the unconfirmed attributes in the live-table to present a question. It is worthwhile to note that the sequence of the attributes in live-table is variable, which means the priority of the attributes used in initiative guiding can be changed for users’ preference in shopping. A process of Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Kaebling et al., 1996) is used to achieve such flexibility, according to the analysis of the users’ questions collected in passive understanding mode. Ch2R would confirm every attribute, however, this would lead to too many times of interactions with user, and it looks a little mechanical. We address this problem by offering a recommendation in the initiative guiding process once there are only limited numbers of candidates, e.g. 1, 2 or 3 candidates. Such recommendation limits the interactions and can embody the profession of Ch2R in shopping guide. 3.2 Passive Understanding We now turn to the passive understandin</context>

Finally, we employed question type patterns for question structure recognition, matching the only one question type pattern for any input question (Huang et al., 2014). Sentence Compression For all kinds of languages, sentences are diversified and innumerable, but the sentence structures are limited. By sentence compression, the diversity of user inputs can be recognized and categorized into limited sentence structures, i.e. question type pattern. Given an input source sentence of words x = x„ X2, ... x„ , a target compression y is formed by removing any subset of these words (Knight and Marcu, 2002). The aim of the sentence compression in our system is to produce a summary of a single sentence that retains the most important structure information while remaining grammatical.

It also leads to good performance with limited question type patterns (30 question type patterns in our current dialogue system) (Huang et al., 2014). The procedure of question type pattern recognition is shown in Figure 5. Due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation in Stanford Parser, to raise the matching rate, we remark the word tags by employing a more satisfied word segmentation interface in the first step of question type pattern recognition. Given a compressed interrogative sentence, ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003) is introduced to remark the word tags and get the syntax sequence. In the 4-set question type pattern, the interrogative word type is not used as recognition factor. The similarities of interrogative sentence type, the interrogative phrases and the sentence structure are taken as the three factors for computing the similarity between the compressed interrogative sentence and any question type pattern in question type patterns base. Figure 6 shows how to calculate the similarity between the source syntax sequence and the target syntax sequence, i.e. the sentence structure in a certain question</context>

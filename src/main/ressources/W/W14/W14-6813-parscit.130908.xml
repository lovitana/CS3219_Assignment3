Parallel corpora are essential resources for
the construction of bilingual term dictionary
of historical classics. To obtain large-scale
parallel corpora, this paper proposes a sen-
tence alignment method based on mode pre-
diction and term translation pairs. On one
hand, the method rebuilds the sentence
alignment process according to characteris-
tics of the translation of historical classics,
and adds mode prediction into the sentence
alignment. On the other hand, due to the lack
of bilingual ancient Chinese dictionary, the
method exploits the term translation pairs ex-
tracted from manually aligned sentence pairs
to perform alignment. The method first pre-
dicts the alignment mode probability accord-
ing to the character number, punctuation
number and some characters of Chinese sen-
tence, then performs sentence alignment us-
ing length alignment probability, term align-
ment probability and mode probability. Be-
sides, the method selects anchor sentence
pairs based on sentence length and predicted
mode to prevent the spread of alignment er-
rors. The experiment on ”Shi Ji” demon-
strates that mode prediction and term transla-
tion pair both enhance the performance of
sentence alignment obviously.

<bodyText confidence="0.999970347826087">
Translating the classics into English and intro-
ducing them to the world is an important way to
spread Chinese culture. Because of the dynamic
nature of historical development and huge differ-
ences between Chinese and Western languages,
the translation of classics is very difficult. Bilin-
gual term dictionary is very helpful for transla-
tion of historical classics. The term dictionary
can be built by extracting term translation pairs
from bilingual parallel corpora. Aiming at ob-
taining large-scale parallel corpora, we study the
sentence alignment of historical classics. Cur-
rently the bilingual sentence alignment methods
are mainly divided into following four types: (1)
the method based on length(Gale and Church,
1993; Lu et al., 2003), which performs sentence
alignment using the sentence length relation; (2)
the method based on dictionary(Yu et al., 2010),
which performs sentence alignment using the
lexicon translation in bilingual dictionary; (3)the
hybrid method(Moore, 2002; Chen and Lin, 2009;
Tian et al., 2009), which makes use of many
kinds of information including sentence length to
improve the accuracy of alignment; (4) the
method base on mode classification(Fattah et al.,
2007); which regards sentence alignment as a
mode classification problem and exploits classi-
fier to align sentences.
Due to the various meanings of historical clas-
sics, the ratio of the sentence length between his-
torical classics and its English translation is not
uniform. Thus alignment method using sentence
length alone does not have good performance.
Owing to lack of ancient Chinese bilingual dic-
tionary, we exploit the term translation pairs ex-
tracted from the sentence pairs aligned manually
to do sentence alignment. Since the translator
needs to explain the hiding meaning of historical
classics when translating classics into English,
the sentence alignment modes of classics are al-
most all “one-to-many”. The sentence alignment
of historical classics can be considered as finding
corresponding English translation for every Chi-
nese sentence. According to the above character-
istics of historical classics, this paper proposed a
sentence alignment method based on mode pre-

first predicts the alignment mode probability
based on the features of Chinese sentence, then

The &amp;quot;terms&amp;quot; in historical classics refer to the of-
ficial title, posthumous, person name, location
name and other titles. The terms appear frequent-
ly in historical classics. If a term occurs in a Chi-
nese sentence, then its translation should occurs
in the corresponding position of English sentence.

sentence pair (c, e) , the alignment function is
defined as:

2.4 Alignment Mode Probability

<bodyText confidence="0.999558733333333">
The historical classics are translated from Chi-
nese to English. When translator sees a Chinese
sentence, he almost determines how many Eng-
lish sentences should be used to translate the
Chines sentence. Thus, the calculation of align-
ment mode probability can be considered as a
classification problem of mode. We input a Chi-
nese sentence to the classifier, and the classifier
d the charac-
ters selected by feature selection function to pre-
dict the mode probability. We choose Infor-
mation Gain (IG) as the feature function, which
measures the number of bits of information ob-
tained for category prediction by knowing the
presence or absence of a character in a sentence.

find English anchor sentence according to Chi-
nese anchor sentence. To ensure the anchor sen-
tences is correct, Chinese anchor sentence must
satisfy the following four conditions: (1) The
anchor sentence is not the first sentence or the
last sentence of the paragraph; (2) The alignment
modes of the two sentences around the anchor
sentence should be predicted as (1:1); (3) The
length of anchor sentence should be less than the
length threshold Thl; (4) Two sentences around
anchor sentence should have Thi more charac-
ters than anchor sentence. Condition (1) is de-
fined because the anchor sentence has no func-
tion in alignment when it is first or last sentence.
Conditions (2), (3) and (4) guarantee that corre-
sponding sentence of anchor Chinese sentence
has the smallest length in surrounding sentences.
After the Chinese anchor sentence is determined,
the English sentence of highest alignment proba-
bility is selected as English anchor. To enhance
the computation efficiency, we do not search
English anchor sentences in all sentences of the
English paragraph. Instead, we find the anchor
sentence in a window whose size is wind and
whose center is at position pose. Position pose is
the corresponding position of Chinese anchor
sentence, calculated as formula (12).

The bilingual corpora used in the experiment are
composed of Shi Ji and its corresponding English
translations drawn from Records of the Grand
Historian, which is well-recognized authoritative
translation by famous sinologist Burton Watson.
We extract 1233 sentence pairs as test corpora
from 7 hereditary houses, which are The Heredi-
tary House of King Yuan of Ch&apos;u, The Hereditary
Houses of Ching and Yen, The Hereditary House
of King Tao-hui of Ch&apos;I, The Hereditary House
of Prime Minister Hsiao, etc. We aligned manu-
ally 4144 sentence pairs to construct the parallel
corpora as training corpora from five consecutive
basic annals, which are Basic Annals of Qin,
Basic Annals of the First Emperor of the Qin,
Basic Annals of Hsiang Yü, Basic Annals of Em-
peror Kao-tsu and Basic Annals of Empress Lü.
We extract 641 term translation pairs from the
training corpora to calculate term alignment
probability. The parameters of the proposed
method are set as following: weigh parameters
 1 0.55, 2  0.45 , length threshold Thl 12 ,
interval threshold Thi  5.
Since we find corresponding translation for
Chinese sentence one by one, almost all the sen-

our method is nearly the same. We only employ
precision p to test the method, which is as fol-
lows.

Table 1 shows that both the method not using

from table 1 that the use of the anchors signifi-

can effectively prevent the error spread of the

reasonable since long sentences prefer “one-to-
many” mode and short sentences tend to be “one-
to-one” mode. The proposed method extracts the
mode probability for the sentence with different
features based on the training corpora, and em-
ploy different alignment probability according to
features of the aligned sentence, so the precision
of the proposed method is higher. However,
since the model probability prediction is not very
accurate, sometimes wrong mode probability
leads to alignment errors. This is why the role of
model prediction is not as significant as we ex-

Because of the dynamic nature of historical development and huge differences between Chinese and Western languages, the translation of classics is very difficult. Bilingual term dictionary is very helpful for translation of historical classics. The term dictionary can be built by extracting term translation pairs from bilingual parallel corpora. Aiming at obtaining large-scale parallel corpora, we study the sentence alignment of historical classics. Currently the bilingual sentence alignment methods are mainly divided into following four types: (1) the method based on length(Gale and Church, 1993; Lu et al., 2003), which performs sentence alignment using the sentence length relation; (2) the method based on dictionary(Yu et al., 2010), which performs sentence alignment using the lexicon translation in bilingual dictionary; (3)the hybrid method(Moore, 2002; Chen and Lin, 2009; Tian et al., 2009), which makes use of many kinds of information including sentence length to improve the accuracy of alignment; (4) the method base on mode classification(Fattah et al., 2007); which regards sentence alignment as a mode classification problem and exploits classifier to align sentences.

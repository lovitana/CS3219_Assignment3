Recent initiatives in language technology have led to the development of at least minimal language
processing toolkits for all EU-official languages as well as for languages with a large number of speakers
worldwide such as Chinese and Arabic. This is a big step towards the automatic processing and/or
extraction of information, especially from official documents and newspapers, where the standard,
literary language is used.
Apart from those official languages, a large number of dialects or closely-related language variants are
in daily use, not only as spoken colloquial languages but also in some written media, e.g., in SMS, chats,
and social networks. Building language resources and tools for them from scratch is expensive, but the
efforts can often be reduced by making use of pre-existing resources and tools for related, resource-richer
languages.
Examples of closely-related language variants include the different variants of Spanish in Latin America,
the Arabic dialects in North Africa and the Middle East, German in Germany, Austria and Switzerland,
French in France and in Belgium, Dutch in the Netherlands and Flemish in Belgium, etc. Examples
of pairs of related languages include Swedish-Norwegian, Bulgarian-Macedonian, Serbian-Bosnian,
Spanish-Catalan, Russian-Ukrainian, Irish-Gaelic Scottish, Malay-Indonesian, Turkish–Azerbaijani,
Mandarin-Cantonese, Hindi–Urdu, and many other.
The workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in building language technology applications
that make use of language closeness to exploit existing resources in a related language or a language
variant. A previous version of this workshop, organised at RANLP 2013, attracted a lot of research
interest, showing the need for further activities.
We received 20 submissions and we selected 11 papers for presentation. The papers cover the following
general NLP topics: Parsing, Variety and Adaptation, and Machine Translation.
We would like to thank our reviewers for the professional and in-time reviewing!

Date and time descriptors play an important role in cultural record keeping. As part of digi-
tal access and information retrieval on heritage databases it is becoming increasingly important
that date descriptors are not matched as strings but that their semantics are properly understood
and interpreted by man and machine alike. This paper describes a prototype system designed
to resolve temporal expressions from English language cultural heritage records to ISO 8601
compatible date expressions. The architecture we advocate calls for a two stage resolution with
a “semantic layer” between the input and ISO 8601 output. The system is inspired by a similar
system for German language records and was tested on real world data from the National Gallery
of Ireland in Dublin. Results from an evaluation with two senior art and metadata experts from
the gallery are reported.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999712954545455">
Preserving a memory of past events has been central to human culture for millennia and may even be
seen as a defining element of cultural life in general. The practice of specifying locations in time for this
purpose transcends cultural boundaries. The earliest precursors of the Chinese lunisolar calendar can be
traced back to the second millennium before Christ. In ancient Attica the “eponymous archon” lent his
name to the year he ruled in and a similar system was employed by republican Romans. The introduction
of the Julian calendar and its Georgian reform, although haphazardly adopted, has eventually led to a
widely accepted standard for locating events in time (although alternative calendars exist and thrive to
this day). The advent of the computer age has brought with it stricter requirements for such standards, for
instance that of unambiguous machine readability. A number of such standards for encoding the meaning
or extension of temporal expressions have emerged in recent years (ISO 8601, TimeML, VRA core).
However, legacy records in the field of cultural heritage still abound with natural language descriptions
of dates and date ranges that are not expressed in a standardised form, such as &amp;quot;around 1660&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;late
15th century&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1720-30 (?)&amp;quot;. The non-standard nature of such expressions is compounded by inherent
uncertainty about the dates which is expressed through uncertainty markers such as &amp;quot;around&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;(?)&amp;quot; or
similar. While human experts have little difficulty interpreting such expressions these are not amenable
to machine-based processing and thus are not directly useful for querying databases based on dates, for
instance. The latter purpose is much better served by date ranges with a clear beginning and end.
We argue for conceptually splitting the process of “translating”, “converting” or otherwise associating
informal descriptions of dates with concrete date ranges with an unambiguous beginning and end. A first
step should capture the semantics of the original expression including possible uncertainty markers with
as little loss in meaning as possible.1 The target of this step should be a language independent ontology
or semantic standard, such as the VRA core 4.0 date element. A second step should then map from a

1What we mean by minimising “loss in meaning” is essentially that in a first step uncertainty markers should be kept (albeit
in a standardized form) rather then resolved to a date range (i.e. “c.1888” → “c(1888)” instead of “c.1888” → “1878-1898”).

user, institution or context specific preferences, using intelligent defaults in the absence of preferences.
In this paper we describe a prototype system designed to resolve temporal expressions from English
language cultural heritage records to ISO 8601 compatible date expressions. The system is inspired by
a similar system for German language records and was tested on real life data from the National Gallery
of Ireland in Dublin and evaluated by two senior art and metadata experts from the gallery. The default
rules for converting the “meaning” of date expressions to date ranges were found to be superior to the
heuristics currently configured by the National Gallery in their collection management system.

2 Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999359583333333">
The National Gallery of Ireland (NGI) has developed a set of in-house standards for cataloguing date
expressions related to the creation of artworks (Appendix A and B). These standards complement the
editorial guidelines outlined in the NGI house style guide for works of art in the collection and they must
be applied when entering the data into the relevant field on TMS2 (The Museum System), the collection
management system used by the Gallery. These guidelines have been created based on best practice
standards for cataloguing date expressions. There are several authoritative resources that institutions can
consult to draft their own in house cataloguing standards, including date format and epoch descriptors:
AAT3 (Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus), CDWA4 (Categories for the Description of Works of Art) or the
AAE Style Guide5 (Association of Art Editors Style Guide), to mention just a few.
As shown in Appendix A and B, the NGI standards cover a diverse set of date expressions, from
specific dates to more generic ones, giving the opportunity to enter into the system a range of years,
decades or centuries. The date values are expressed as four digit years. More specific dates related to
other events connected to the creation of the art work (for example for published volumes or different
print editions), are recorded in the ‘Historical Dates field’ where the required date can be selected from
a pop up calendar and the type of date can be selected from a drop down list (for example ‘Published’).
The Date label on TMS consists of three main fields: Date, which displays the actual date or range of
dates related to the creation of the art work and which appears on the main object record screen as part
of the basic object tombstone information; Begin Date and End Date, which represent the earliest and
the latest possible years from a range of dates during which the artwork was created (Fig. 1). The Begin
Date and End Date are not displayed in the Date label on the data entry screen of a record, as they are
used for indexing and searching purposes only. Through the Simple Search and the Advanced Search
functionality in the system it is possible to retrieve records with a range of dates, by either searching for
earliest date, latest date or a certain time between these dates, the resulting records being drawn from the
values recorded in the Begin and End Date.

The Begin and End Dates can be inserted automatically by the system either by pressing the ‘Calc’
button or by accepting a suggestion for both Begin Date and End Date which is updated automatically ev-
ery time a new value is inserted in the Date field. The suggestions can be accepted or modified manually
and then saved. A date expression can also be suggested by the system when entering the relevant years
directly into Begin and End Date. In this case the ‘Calc’ button prompts a pop up window with different
date expressions based on the years inserted as beginning and end. For example, by entering ‘1575’ and
‘1578’ in the Begin and End Date, the suggestion box for the Date field will list the following options:
‘1575-1578’; ‘c.1576’; ‘late 16th century’. When date ranges include two specific years (for example in
the case of ‘YYYY/YYYY’ or ‘YYYY-YYYY’) the two year values are automatically suggested in the
Begin and End Date fields. When a single year is inserted in the Date field, the Begin and End Date are
automatically filled with that same year value.
Through the configuration menu it is possible to specify the range of years to be ‘suggested’ in the
Begin and End Date when entering a particular date expression in the Date field. By default this applies
for the circa label (in the NGI case the range is 5 years before and after the specified date) and decades.
Although the automatic suggestions for Begin and End Date are configurable through the back end of
the system, manual input is still necessary for accuracy when entering certain date expressions. Centuries
for example (in all their formats, from ‘xxth century’ to ‘early/mid/late xxth century’) are not recognized
by Begin and End Date, which in these cases need to be filled in manually. However the process works
in reverse: when inserting the correct earliest and latest year that indicate a century span, the suggestion
box for the Date field displays different options, including the correct ‘xxth century’ format.
On the other hand, in the case of decades, the relevant Begin Date and End Date are correctly suggested
when inserting the ‘YYYYs’ format in the Date field, while, when entering the relevant years indicating
the time span of a decade in the Begin and End date, the options listed as suggestions for the Date field do
not include the correct format, giving instead the option of selecting ‘YYYY-YYYY’ as an alternative.
Similarly the Date field does not distinguish between years separated by an ‘or’, a dash or a hyphen
when displaying the suggestions based on years inserted in Begin and End Date: when two different
years are inserted in the Begin and End Date, the only relevant option listed by the system is the range
of years separated by a hyphen. However, when entering the same date expressions in the Date field
whether separated by ‘or’, dash or hyphen, the correct values are inserted in the Begin and End Date.
As the Date field is a free-text field on TMS, the process of manually entering date values, especially
the ones that indicate uncertainty and include a prefix and non-numerical values, gives more room for
error. In addition to this, not every date expression inserted in the Date field is recognised by the Begin
and End Dates, in which case these also have to be entered manually.
At the same time the automatic suggestions given for the Date field when entering Begin Date and End
seem to be more comprehensive and work better and they are helpful in giving the opportunity to select
the correct option without having to manually enter the data, thus reducing the possibility of error. In the
case of the NGI some configuration is further needed to make the most of the automated system already
in place. In particular it would be useful to include in the provided suggestions for the Begin and End
Date, those date expressions that are not currently recognised by the system.

3 Methodology and data set
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999905666666667">
The development of our system is inspired by an earlier system of temporal expression resolution for
German language date expressions, an auxiliary part of a research project concerned with information
retrieval on digital repositories of works of art, (Isemann and Ahmad, 2014). The approach was an
iterative development cycle of successively resolving ever more complex date and time descriptors and
mapping them to unambiguous time spans in ISO 8601 format. The data used were German date entries
in a commercially available digital collection of 40,000 works of art.6 Example expressions from this
data set are: “1707-1712”, “1734/39”, “1790-3”, “12./13. Jh.”, “1. Drittel 16. Jh.”, “1420-1375 v. Chr.”.
These examples represent date ranges that have a fairly well defined beginning and end. One may
perhaps argue whether the 13th century should include the year 1300 or not, but in general the intended

boundaries are reasonably clear. The following examples, however, are compounded by the fact that they
contain uncertainty markers which leave the precise date range that should be assigned to them up to
context and interpretation: “um 1568”, “1642 (?)”, “Vor 1650”, “ab 1486”, “nach 1776-77”.
For the experiments presented here, we obtained a similar although much smaller English language
data set from the National Gallery of Ireland. The data consisted of 939 records from the NGI database,
comprising date expressions such as “1791 to 1794”, “1870/72”, “1740s”, “18th century”, “1st February
1751”, “?c.1893”, “after 1752”, “late 16th century”, “mid-1930s”. Unlike in the German data set, most
date expressions in the NGI data are already associated with a ‘Begin Date’ and ‘End Date’ either calcu-
lated by the NGI collection management system or manually entered by NGI staff (compare Section 2).
These date ranges sanctioned by art experts present a valuable additional resource which may serve as
training data for statistical learning or as a benchmark to compare against.
In contrast to the German language system we are conceptually using a two stage approach in which
we first attempt to represent the intended meaning of a date expression (‘intension’) and only then map
it to a date range for search and retrieval (one might call this range the ‘extension’ of a date expression).
For the representation of date expression semantics (intension) we have chosen the VRA core 4.0 set of
metadata elements and here in particular the ‘date’ element.7 VRA core is a set of categories defined and
maintained by the Data Standards Committee of the Visual Resources Association.8 The latest version
4.0 dates from 2007. The standard has been used for semantic annotation (cf. Hollink et al. (2003) which
use VRA core 3.0) and defines mappings to other metadata schemata, such as Dublin Core,9 CDWA,10
CCO11 (Cataloging Cultural Objects) and its own predecessors (VRA core 2.0 and 3.0). As value ranges
the standard recommends widely used thesauri (AAT12) or controlled vocabularies (ULAN13) or in the
case of dates the ISO 8601 standard. Structurally, the standard prescribes that ‘date’ elements have a
‘type’ attribute (such as ‘creation’, ‘design’, ‘alteration’) and may have an ‘earliestDate’ and ‘latestDate’
subelement, both of which should only take ISO 8601 compatible values and can be modified by a
boolean ‘circa’ attribute.
The semantic representation is the point of departure for the resolution of a date expression to a con-
crete date range. This leaves room for interpretation, especially in cases where a ‘circa’ flag is present.
Ideally this mapping should be governed by preferences at the user and/or institution level (similar to the
guidelines presented in Appendices A and B).
While the interpretation of these dates may vary on a case-by-case basis and even experts may disagree,
we believe that certain default rules will allow at least a rough approximation of the intended time range in
many cases. Analysing the data we noticed that mentions of years are not uniformly distributed in terms
of the digit they end on. Figure 2 shows the relative frequency of year end digits for the German data set
(red line) in expressions involving a ‘circa’ flag (German: “um”). Assuming a uniform distribution of
years the frequencies should be 801.1 throughout. It is statistically extremely unlikely that the observed
deviation from a uniform distribution is due to chance variation (chi squared test, 9 degrees of freedom,
p &lt; 0.001). As it appears equally unlikely that artists over the centuries have had a particular propensity
to be more productive in years ending in 0 and 5, we believe that the natural explanation is that art
historians documenting temporality tend to gravitate to &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; numbers in cases of greater uncertainty.
As an upshot we would like to suggest that all else being equal approximate dates involving years should
be seen as less certain if they end in 0 or 5 than if they end in other digits. Accordingly we add ±10
years to years ending in “0”, ±5 to years ending in “5” and ±1 to years ending in other digits. Table 1
shows a number of the resolutions our system can perform.

<bodyText confidence="0.999973263157895">
We implemented a rule-based date expression resolver for the expressions in the English language Na-
tional Gallery data set (achieving nearly complete coverage) with the set of heuristics outlined in the
previous section (cf. Table 1). Two art history and meta data experts from the National Gallery agreed
to participate in an evaluation of the output of our resolution system compared against the current date
range entry in the National Gallery database. The entries in the NGI database are not a direct feature of
the collection management system, but rather of how the system is currently used.
We observed that our system output agreed with the NGI entries in about half of the cases (58%). In
order not to burden our volunteers’ time too much we did not evaluate on the complete data set, but on
a randomly extracted subset in which we only included cases where our system output differed from
the existing gallery records. We used a random number generator in Java to extract records until we
reached a limit of 50 cases in which the two date interpretations were different. This limit was reached
after selecting a total of 104 entries. The 50 non-trivial cases were compiled into a list comprised of the
original date expression and a choice of two different date ranges each, one from the NGI records and
one from our system. The order of the choices was randomized independently for each individual record.
The two evaluation participants were given this list together with a short introductory text outlining
the background and purpose of the evaluation. They were then instructed to select which of the two
date range alternatives they felt best captured the meaning of the date expression or indicate that they
had no preference. Introductory paragraphs in the evaluation stressed that while individual context may
sometimes enter into such a decision, they should think of the given date expressions as generic examples.

While this may be seen as an encouraging result for our date range recommender system it has to be
said that in their overall preference our two evaluators were leaning different ways. While one over-
whelmingly agreed with our system recommendations (preferring the NGI alternative in just two cases
with nine ties), the other was leaning towards the NGI records (preferring our system in just eleven cases
with twelve ties). Overall the two evaluators agreed in ten of the 50 cases (Cohen’s kappa = -0.048).
We believe that the reason for the differing opinions between our two evaluators may be that one
of them is working closely with the NGI database and is therefore very familiar with the status quo,
including certain agreed in-house standards. The other evaluator, who was leaning towards the rules
implemented in our system, is from the curatorial department and concerned with absolute and relative
dating of works of art in a more theoretical way. A more thorough evaluation is needed in order to
determine if the more flexible rules we are advocating would be appreciated by an expert user community.

The resolution of temporal expressions is an important topic in the information extraction and semantic
web community and employing these methods on cultural heritage texts in particular has been the focus
of research spanning these fields and the emergent discipline of digital humanities.
Context-free grammars (CFG) for the resolution of temporal expressions have been employed by An-
geli et al. (2012) and Kauppinen et al. (2010). Angeli et al. (2012) attempt to learn a probabilistic CFG for
time and date expressions and at the same time an expectation maximation framework for the resolution
of pragmatic ambiguity in time expressions (e.g. ‘Friday’ may refer to last or next Friday, ‘last Friday’
may refer to the previous Friday or the Friday two weeks ago etc.). For training their system they employ
the TempEval-2 Task A dataset.14 Despite the relatively small training set (1052 time expressions) they
report comparable performance of their system with leading rule-based temporal resolvers.
Kauppinen et al. (2010) employ fuzzy sets towards the representation and querying of temporally
disputable periodic expressions from cultural heritage such as ‘late-Roman-era’, ‘Middle Ages’ or ‘be-
ginning of the 1st century BC’, which can vary due to subjectivity or lack of hard records. They define
a date span with a fuzzy beginning and end which encompasses the widest possible bounds for a tem-
poral period and then a more concise beginning and end which encompasses more constrained bounds.
Queries are matched against the fuzzy set using a bespoke querying model which finds the level of over-
lap between the query and the fuzzy set. They test their theories on a set of records from the Ancient
Milan15 project, representing fuzzy date ranges as four RDF triples, one for each of the date points. They
represent definite temporal expressions such as First half of the 1st Century BC in Backus-Naur form.
Research into frameworks for temporal expression extraction in the computational sciences, (Chang
and Manning (2012), Strötgen and Gertz (2010), Sun et al. (2013)) has tended to focus on domains
such as clinical texts and newswire for developing temporal expression resolution systems. We believe,
however, that there is a clear and present need for systems and frameworks which can extract structured
information from cultural heritage text, particularly in the domain of fine art image catalogues. These
methodologies can enable the development of smarter retrieval systems for catalogues of cultural history

resource, il Dizionario geografico, fisico e storico della Toscana16 created by cultural historian Emanuele
Repetti in the early 19th century. They focus on the resolution of temporal expressions’ indeterminancy
and varying granularity in Italian temporal expressions, such as around X, circa. X, near the end of the
X century and others. They represent such indeterminacy using a four category classification of date
expressions and a probabilistic approach from the TSQL2 standard, (Snodgrass et al. (1994)). Lilis and
others (2005) use multidimensional RDF in their representation of cultural artifacts in a museum setting.
Smith (2002) focuses on detecting events in unstructured historical text with dates forming the main
focus of his study. The author investigates the co-occurrence of place names and dates in 19th century text
and extracts a geo-located list of events from the text. He mentions that 98% of numerical tokens in the
texts refer to dates, although in different text genres, date information may be more vaguely expressed.
Furthermore, he finds that certain dates are expressed as a calendar day and others refer merely to the year
an event occurred. These expressions can prove problematic for traditional date processing algorithms,
and often a more complex mapping is required to convert these textual representations to a computational
formalism such as the CIDOC specification. Chang and Manning (2012) focus on generic temporal
expressions with their SUTIME parser, which represents date and temporal information extracted from
text using the TIMEX3 tag format from the TimeML (Boguraev and Ando (2005)) standard.
An emerging trend in date resolution literature encompasses the big data paradigm. Blamey et al.
(2013) develop a probabilistic approach toward modelling everyday natural language date expressions17
using textual data from image descriptions and EXIF18 data from uploaded photos on the flickr website.

We have presented and tested a system specifically designed for the resolution of date expressions in
cultural heritage legacy records and we have argued for a ‘semantic layer’ between the literal expressions
and the date range resolution. Our evaluation, although small scale, suggests that such a system may
potentially be able to improve even records which already incorporate date resolutions, if slightly more
complex rules than are contained in the current system or data entry guidelines are implemented.
A number of possible lines of future work suggest themselves. In order to arrive at an explicit local
grammar for ‘heritage dates’ (cf. Kauppinen et al. (2010) and Angeli et al. (2012)), we have created a
context-free grammar, that accepts roughly the same input as our current rule set. Initial examination
suggests that the non-lexical part of the grammar can cover both English and German language data
given appropriate lexicons. The grammar phrases can be mapped to representations in the semantic layer
thereby in effect creating a system which could process multilingual input and produce consistent output.
A further extension to the system would involve the processing of semantically more complex temporal
period expressions, such as “Victorian”, “Edwardian”, “Gründerzeit”, “Gilded Age” or “Renaissance”.
Examples tied to the reign of a monarch tend towards a more defined scope however wider-ranging
and more culturally-disputed periods such as “the Renaissance” tend to attract a less precise beginning
and end-date than the former examples and may require a more complex set of semantics. Data-driven
approaches could be employed to model the temporal boundaries for temporal expressions of a more
vague nature. Angeli et al. (2012) demonstrate that this may be feasible even on relatively small datasets.
Examples which could benefit from an ontological augmentation involving events and periods include
the practice of dating works of art with implicit reference to such periods based on a believed or pre-
viously confirmed date for a major event such as a battle or war. One example of this practice could
be an artwork dated “after 1453”, with the date actually representing the current dating of the fall of
Constantinople. As historical information is updated or revised, the corresponding date range estimating
the temporal origin of a work could be resolved based on updated information for the reference event.
Similar suggestions were made in (Isemann and Ahmad, 2009). Perhaps the practically most relevant
example of this kind could be cross-referencing the lifespan of an artist associated with the production

<abstract confidence="0.997135818181818">Date and time descriptors play an important role in cultural record keeping. As part of digital access and information retrieval on heritage databases it is becoming increasingly important that date descriptors are not matched as strings but that their semantics are properly understood and interpreted by man and machine alike. This paper describes a prototype system designed to resolve temporal expressions from English language cultural heritage records to ISO 8601 compatible date expressions. The architecture we advocate calls for a two stage resolution with a “semantic layer” between the input and ISO 8601 output. The system is inspired by a similar system for German language records and was tested on real world data from the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin. Results from an evaluation with two senior art and metadata experts from the gallery are reported.</abstract>

A more thorough evaluation is needed in order to determine if the more flexible rules we are advocating would be appreciated by an expert user community. 6 Related Work The resolution of temporal expressions is an important topic in the information extraction and semantic web community and employing these methods on cultural heritage texts in particular has been the focus of research spanning these fields and the emergent discipline of digital humanities. Context-free grammars (CFG) for the resolution of temporal expressions have been employed by Angeli et al. (2012) and Kauppinen et al. (2010). Angeli et al. (2012) attempt to learn a probabilistic CFG for time and date expressions and at the same time an expectation maximation framework for the resolution of pragmatic ambiguity in time expressions (e.g. ‘Friday’ may refer to last or next Friday, ‘last Friday’ may refer to the previous Friday or the Friday two weeks ago etc.). For training their system they employ the TempEval-2 Task A dataset.14 Despite the relatively small training set (1052 time expressions) they report comparable performance of their system with leading rule-based temporal resolvers. </context>

In particular it would be useful to include in the provided suggestions for the Begin and End Date, those date expressions that are not currently recognised by the system. 3 Methodology and data set The development of our system is inspired by an earlier system of temporal expression resolution for German language date expressions, an auxiliary part of a research project concerned with information retrieval on digital repositories of works of art, (Isemann and Ahmad, 2014). The approach was an iterative development cycle of successively resolving ever more complex date and time descriptors and mapping them to unambiguous time spans in ISO 8601 format. The data used were German date entries in a commercially available digital collection of 40,000 works of art.6 Example expressions from this data set are: “1707-1712”, “1734/39”, “1790-3”, “12./13. Jh.”, “1. Drittel 16. Jh.”, “1420-1375 v. Chr.”. These examples represent date ranges that have a fairly well defined beginning and end. One may perhaps argue whether the 13th century should include the year 1300 or not</context>

They represent such indeterminacy using a four category classification of date expressions and a probabilistic approach from the TSQL2 standard, (Snodgrass et al. (1994)).

Smith (2002) focuses on detecting events in unstructured historical text with dates forming the main focus of his study. The author investigates the co-occurrence of place names and dates in 19th century text and extracts a geo-located list of events from the text. He mentions that 98% of numerical tokens in the texts refer to dates, although in different text genres, date information may be more vaguely expressed. Furthermore, he finds that certain dates are expressed as a calendar day and others refer merely to the year an event occurred. These expressions can prove problematic for traditional date proc</context>

Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.99993952">
Depression is typically diagnosed as be-
ing present or absent. However, depres-
sion severity is believed to be continu-
ously distributed rather than dichotomous.
Severity may vary for a given patient daily
and seasonally as a function of many vari-
ables ranging from life events to environ-
mental factors. Repeated population-scale
assessment of depression through ques-
tionnaires is expensive. In this paper we
use survey responses and status updates
from 28,749 Facebook users to develop a
regression model that predicts users’ de-
gree of depression based on their Face-
book status updates. Our user-level pre-
dictive accuracy is modest, significantly
outperforming a baseline of average user
sentiment. We use our model to estimate
user changes in depression across seasons,
and find, consistent with literature, users’
degree of depression most often increases
from summer to winter. We then show the
potential to study factors driving individ-
uals’ level of depression by looking at its
most highly correlated language features.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926380000001">
Depression, a common mental disorder, greatly
contributes to the economic, social, and phys-
ical burden of people worldwide. Along with
other mental disorders it has been related to
early termination of education, unstable mar-
riages, teenage pregnancy, financial problems, role
impairment, heart disease, and other negative out-
comes (Kessler and Bromet, 2013; Lichtman et al.,
2014)
Currently, depression is primarily assessed
through surveys. Diagnoses require a medical or
psychological evaluation, and are typically classi-
fied into discrete categories (absent, mild, moder-
ate, severe). Clinicians rely on retrospective re-
ports by patients to monitor symptoms and treat-
ment. Unobtrusive assessments based on language
use in Facebook and social media usage could
amend both the self-help resources available to pa-
tients as well as repertoire of clinicians with richer
information. Such a tool could allow for more fre-
quent and fine grained (i.e., continuously scored)
assessment and could provide contextualized in-
formation (e.g. specific words and online activi-
ties that are contributing to the user’s depression
score).
Here, we predict and characterize one’s degree
of depression (DDep) based on their language use
in Facebook. Datasets connecting surveyed de-
pression with language in Facebook are rare at
best. To operationalize DDep, we use the depres-
sion facet scores of the “Big 5” item pool (Gold-
berg, 1999) from the MyPersonality dataset. This
provides a continuous value outcome, for which
we fit a regression model based on ngrams, LDA
topics, and lexica usage. By predicting continuous
values, rather than classes, one can track changes
in DDep of varying size across time; we find sig-
nificantly more users’ DDep increases from sum-
mer to winter than vice-versa.
Our primary contribution is the exploration
of predicting continuous-valued depression scores
from individuals’ social media messages. To the
best of our knowledge this has not previously been
studied, with other social media and depression
work focused on discrete classes: present or ab-
sent. We compare our predictive model of DDep
to one derived from a state-of-the-art sentiment
lexicon and look at changes across seasons. Fi-
nally, we characterize DDep by looking at its top
ngram and topic correlates.

2.1 Depression
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99997954">
Depression is generally characterized by persistent
low mood, poor concentration, fatigue, and little
interest in normally enjoyable activities. Depres-
sion can range from mild to severe, and can occur
as an acute episode (major depressive episode),
extend chronically over time (major depressive
disorder, persistent depressive disorder), reoccur
after a period of remission (recurrent depression),
or occur at specific periods (seasonal affective dis-
order, postpartum depression, premenstrual dys-
phoric disorder). Prevalence rates vary; the World
Health Organization estimates that over 350 mil-
lion people worldwide have a depressive disorder,
with many more reporting at least some symptoms
(Organization, 2012). In the U.S., in the World
Health Mental Survey, over half of the respondents
(62%) endorsed at least one diagnostic stem ques-
tions for depression, with 19.2% meeting criteria
for at least one major depressive episode (Kessler
et al., 2010).
Although depression has long been defined as
a single disease with a set of diagnostic criteria,
it often occurs comorbidly with other psycholog-
ical and physical disorders. Anxiety, anger, and
other psychological disorders often co-occur with
depression, and some have suggested that anx-
iety and depression are different manifestations
of the same underlying pathology (Mineka et al.,
1998). An expert panel convened by the Ameri-
can Heart Association recently recommended that
depression be considered a formal risk factor for
heart disease (Lichtman et al., 2014). Depres-
sion has been related to a range of physical con-
ditions, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and chronic pain (Kessler and
Bromet, 2013), although the causal direction is
confounded; it may be that other factors cause
both depression and physical illness (Friedman
and Kern, 2014).
As noted previously, assessing degree of de-
pression as a continuous value allows us to look
at changes in depression across time. There has
been longstanding interest and discussion of sea-
sonal patterns of depression, with observations of
seasonal depressive patterns apparent in ancient
times, and the first systematic description occur-
ring in 1984 (Westrin and Lam, 2007). Com-
monly called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD),
the DSM-V now refers to this pattern as recur-
rent major depressive disorder with a seasonal pat-
tern. A clinical diagnosis of seasonal depression
requires that two major depressive episodes have
occurred in the past two years, with the onset and
remission showing a regular temporal pattern (pre-
dominantly with onset occurring in the fall/winter
and full remission in spring/summer).
Patients with depression often have common
symptoms of low energy, reduced or intensified
psychomotor movements, low concentration, in-
decisiveness, and thoughts of death, as well as
related symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, and
weight gain. A challenge in diagnosis is that it re-
lies on a patient’s historical report, and other pos-
sible causes such as physical illness must be ruled
out. Further, with stigmas against mental illness
and feats about seeking treatment, many cases go
unrecognized, causing considerable burden on the
individual and society as a whole. Prevalence rates
vary, but rigorous reviews suggest a prevalence of
.4% in the U.S., although estimates have been re-
ported as high as 10% (Blazer et al., 1998; Mag-
nusson and Partonen, 2005).
There are a number of different hypotheses
about the pathophysiology of S A D, including cir-
cadian, neurotransmitter, and genetic causes (Lam
and Levitan, 2000). Reviews suggest that light
therapy is an effective and well-tolerated treat-
ment, with effects equal to or larger than antide-
pressants (Golden et al., 2005; Lam and Levitan,
2000; Thompson, 2001; Westrin and Lam, 2007).
Attempts to explain why light therapy is so ef-
fective have included shifting photoperiods (light-
dark cycles, with less light in the winter), changes
in melotonin secretion, and circadian phase shifts
(Lam and Levitan, 2000).
One related explanation for the photoperiod ef-
fect is latitude, with the prevalence of seasonal
depression increasing with growing distance from
the equator. Although there has been some support
for this hypothesis in the U.S. (Rosen et al., 1990),
findings in other countries have been mixed (Mer-
sch et al., 1999). Although latitude may play some
role, other factors such as climate, genetic vulner-
ability, and the sociocultural context may have a
stronger impact.
Altogether, inconsistent results suggest that
there is considerable variation in the magnitude,
causes and manifestations of seasonal depression,
much of which is not fully understood, in part due
to diagnostic issues (Lam and Levitan, 2000). A

weekly or even daily depression assessment tool
would allow us to more fully understand the sea-
sonal and other temporal changes in depression.
We use the “depression facet” scores de-
rived from a subset of the “big-5” personality
items. Specifically, depression is one of sev-
eral facets (e.g. anger, depression, anxiety, self-
consciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability) of
the neuroticism personality factor. Neuroticism
refers to individual differences in the tendency to
experience negative, distressing emotions, and be-
havioral and cognitive styles that result from this
(McCrae and John, 1992). It includes traits such
as tension, depression, frustration, guilt, and self-
consciousness, and is associated with low self-
esteem, irrational thoughts and behaviors, ineffec-
tive coping styles, and somatic complaints.
Various scales have been developed to mea-
sure neuroticism, such as the Eysenck Personality
Questionnaire (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975) and
the NEO-PI-R (Costa and McCrae, 1992). Some
items on these scales overlap with self-reported
items that screen for depression (e.g., personality
item: “I am often down in the dumps”; depression
screening item: “how often have you been feel-
ing down, depressed, or hopeless?”; see Table 1.),
such that the personality items effectively provide
a proxy measure of depressive tendencies.

2.2 Related Work
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878344827586">
Depression has been linked with many online be-
haviors. In fact, even Internet usage itself seems to
vary as a function of being depressed(Katikalapudi
et al., 2012). Other behaviors include social net-
working (Moreno et al., 2011) and differences in
location sharing on Facebook (Park et al., 2013).
Most related to our work, are those using lin-
guistic features to assess various measures of de-
pression. For example, De Choudhury et al.
(2013) used online posting behavior, network
characteristics, and linguistic features when try-
ing to predict depression rather than find its corre-
lates. They used crowdsourcing to screen Twitter
users with the CES-D test (Beekman et al., 1997),
while others analyzed one year of Facebook sta-
tus updates for DSM diagnostic critera of a Major
Depressive Episode (Moreno et al., 2011). In ad-
dition, Park et al. (2013) predicted results of the
Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1961).
While previous works have made major head-
way toward automatic depression assessment tools
from social media, to the best of our knowledge,
none have tried to predict depression as a con-
tinuum rather than a discrete, present or absent,
attribute. For instance, Neuman et al. (2012)
classified blog posts based on whether they con-
tained signs of depression, and De Choudhury et
al. (2013) classified which newfound mothers
would suffer from postpartum depression.

Regression modeling. In order to get a contin-
uous value output from our model, we explored
regression techniques over our training data.
Since this first work exploring regression was
concerned primarily with language content, our
features for predicting depression were based
entirely on language use (other social media
activity and friend networks may be considered in
future work). These features can be broken into
four categories:
ngrams: Ngrams of order to 1 to 3, found via Hap-
pierFunTokenizer, and restricted to those used by
at least 5% of users (resulting in 10,450 ngrams).
The features were encoded as relative frequency of
mentioning each ngram (ng):

lexica: 64 LIWC categories (Pennebaker et al.,
2007) as well as the sentiment lexicon from NRC
Canada (Mohammad et al., 2013).2 Usage of a
lexicon (lex) was calculated similar to the LDA
topics, where w is the weight of the word in the
lexicon in the case of sentiment and always 1 in

We used penalized linear regression to fit our
features to DDep. We experimented with a few pe-
nalization types over the training set and settled on
L2 (“ridge regression”), using Principal Compo-
nents Analysis to first reduce the ngram and topic
features to 10 % of their original size. In order to
ensure users tested provided an adequate amount
of features, we only tested over those with at least
1,000 words. However, we found that including
more users in our training set at the expense of
words per user increased model accuracy. Thus,
we only required our training data users to men-
tion 500 words, essentially allowing more noise in
order to increase the number of training examples.
We also experimented with training models on
two sets of messages: all messages and the sub-
set of messages written in the same three-month
season as the survey administration (season only

vary over time, we reasoned that messages written
closer to survey administration might better reflect
the degree of depression assessed by the survey.
When generating predictions on users in the test

the season only messages model to features from

3.2 Evaluation and Results

<bodyText confidence="0.99992425">
We evaluated accuracy using the Pearson corre-
lation coefficient r between our predictions and
survey-assessed DDep. As a baseline, we built a
regression model simply using the NRC sentiment
(Mohammad et al., 2013) feature.
Accuracies are shown in Table 2. Accuracy was
highest (r = .386) when we trained a model over
all messages from users in the training set and then
applied this model to all messages by users in the
test set. Though our model allows for seasonal
change in depression, we suspect the test across all
messages was more accurate than that of only us-
ing the season in which the users depression was
assessed due to the larger amount messages and
language features provided to the model.
Both models (season-only messages, and all
messages) gave significant (p &lt; 0.05) improve-
ment over the baseline (r = .149) and though
these accuracies may look small, it’s worth not-
ing that a correlation above r = 0.3 is often re-
garded as a strong link between a behavior and a
psychological outcome (Meyer et al., 2001). Still,
we fit many behavior variables (i.e., language use
features) to an outcome and so we might hope

ing more users to train on and taking more fea-
tures into account could improve results. For ex-
ample, people who nearly stopped writing for a
season would be thrown out of our analyses since
it is completely based on language content, even
though they are more likely to be depressed (so-
cial isolation is a common symptom in depres-
sion). Similarly, we do not use demographics in
our models, even though women are more likely
to become depressed than men.
To assess individual seasonal changes in de-
gree of depression, we predicted summer and win-
ter DDep values for each user with at least 1000
words across both summer-only and winter-only
messages, respectively. We then compared the
differences across the seasonal predictions; Fig-

differences across 676 users with sufficient lan-
guage for both seasonal predictions. In line with
the trends seen in survey data, average user-level

= rarely used, blue = moderately used, red = fre-
quently used).
The f-word emerges as both the most correlated
feature (as indicated by the size of the word) and
is highly frequent (indicated by the red color). To-
gether with words such as ‘pissed’ and ‘bloody’,
these curse words suggest hostility or aggression.
Similarly, words such has ‘hate’ and ‘lonely’ sug-
gest negative social relationships.
Perhaps surprisingly, the words ‘depression’
and ‘depressed’ emerge as highly correlated fea-
tures. These face valid features occur infrequently
(as indicated by their grey color), yet are strongly
associated with depressive tendencies, demon-
strating the high statistical power of our approach
applied to this large dataset in identifying signif-
icant but rarely used language features. The both
frequent and highly correlated word ‘why’ hints at
signs of hopelessness and meaninglessness, a core
feature of depressive disorders.
As illustrated in Figure 5, extending the words
and phrase results, automatically derived topics
demonstrate substantial overlap with the major
clinical symptoms of major depressive disorder
(American Psychiatric Association et al., 2013).
Hopelessness and meaninglessness are seemingly
expressed by ‘hopeless’ and ‘helpless’. Perhaps
the most noticable symptom of depression, de-
pressed mood, is expressed in topics mentioning
‘feel’, ‘crap’, ‘sad’, and ‘miserable’.
Depression often affects psychomotor function,
either in terms of fatigue and low energy or in-
versely as insomnia and hyperactivity. Such symp-
toms are reflected in words such as ‘tired’, and
‘sleep’. Depression is often expressed somati-
cally through bodily symptoms, captured through
‘hurt’, ‘my head’ and ‘pain’.
One of the most predictive questions on de-
pressive screening questionnaires asks about sui-
cidal thought, which appears with topics related to
thoughts of death, with words such as ‘kill’, ‘die’,
and ‘dying’.
Topics also reflected hostility, aggression, and
negative relationships with other people. Loneli-
ness has emerged as one of the strongest predic-
tors of physical morbidity and mortality (Hawk-
ley and Cacioppo, 2010), and both ‘lonely’ and
‘alone’ appear as some of the most correlated sin-
gle words. Given such striking descriptive results,
future work might try to detect depression associ-

Depression can be viewed as a continuous con-
struct that changes over time, rather than simply as
being a disease that one has or does not have. We
showed that regression models based on Facebook
language can be used to predict an individual’s de-

development of regression models, many users
write enough on Facebook that we could estimate
changes in their level of depression on a monthly
or even weekly basis. Such estimates, correlated
with word use over time offers potential both for
research at the group-level (“What are the social
and environmental determinants of depression?”,
“How well are talk or medication-based interven-
tions working?”) as well as, eventually, for med-
ical and therapeutic application at the individual
level (“How well am I doing and what depression-
relevant thoughts or behaviors have I disclosed in
the past week?”).

<abstract confidence="0.999678653846154">Depression is typically diagnosed as being present or absent. However, depression severity is believed to be continuously distributed rather than dichotomous. Severity may vary for a given patient daily and seasonally as a function of many variables ranging from life events to environmental factors. Repeated population-scale assessment of depression through questionnaires is expensive. In this paper we use survey responses and status updates from 28,749 Facebook users to develop a regression model that predicts users’ degree of depression based on their Facebook status updates. Our user-level predictive accuracy is modest, significantly outperforming a baseline of average user sentiment. We use our model to estimate user changes in depression across seasons, and find, consistent with literature, users’ degree of depression most often increases from summer to winter. We then show the potential to study factors driving individuals’ level of depression by looking at its most highly correlated language features.</abstract>

For example, De Choudhury et al. (2013) used online posting behavior, network characteristics, and linguistic features when trying to predict depression rather than find its correlates. They used crowdsourcing to screen Twitter users with the CES-D test (Beekman et al., 1997), while others analyzed one year of Facebook status updates for DSM diagnostic critera of a Major Depressive Episode (Moreno et al., 2011). In addition, Park et al. (2013) predicted results of the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1961). While previous works have made major headway toward automatic depression assessment tools from social media, to the best of our knowledge, none have tried to predict depression as a continuum rather than a discrete, present or absent, attribute. For instance, Neuman et al. (2012) classified blog posts based on whether they contained signs of depression, and De Choudhury et al.

A challenge in diagnosis is that it relies on a patient’s historical report, and other possible causes such as physical illness must be ruled out. Further, with stigmas against mental illness and feats about seeking treatment, many cases go unrecognized, causing considerable burden on the individual and society as a whole. Prevalence rates vary, but rigorous reviews suggest a prevalence of .4% in the U.S., although estimates have been reported as high as 10% (Blazer et al., 1998; Magnusson and Partonen, 2005). There are a number of different hypotheses about the pathophysiology of S A D, including circadian, neurotransmitter, and genetic causes (Lam and Levitan, 2000). Reviews suggest that light therapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment, with effects equal to or larger than antidepressants (Golden et al., 2005; Lam and Levitan, 2000; Thompson, 2001; Westrin and Lam, 2007). Attempts to explain why light therapy is so effective have included shifting photoperiods (lightdark cycles, with less light in the winter), changes in melotonin secretion, and circadian</context>

Neuroticism refers to individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions, and behavioral and cognitive styles that result from this (McCrae and John, 1992). It includes traits such as tension, depression, frustration, guilt, and selfconsciousness, and is associated with low selfesteem, irrational thoughts and behaviors, ineffective coping styles, and somatic complaints. Various scales have been developed to measure neuroticism, such as the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975) and the NEO-PI-R (Costa and McCrae, 1992). Some items on these scales overlap with self-reported items that screen for depression (e.g., personality item: “I am often down in the dumps”; depression screening item: “how often have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?”; see Table 1.), such that the personality items effectively provide a proxy measure of depressive tendencies. 2.2 Related Work Depression has been linked with many online behaviors. In fact, even Internet usage itself seems to vary as a function of being depressed(Katikalapudi et al., 2012). Other behaviors include social networking (Moreno et al., 2011) and di</context>

An expert panel convened by the American Heart Association recently recommended that depression be considered a formal risk factor for heart disease (Lichtman et al., 2014). Depression has been related to a range of physical conditions, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic pain (Kessler and Bromet, 2013), although the causal direction is confounded; it may be that other factors cause both depression and physical illness (Friedman and Kern, 2014). As noted previously, assessing degree of depression as a continuous value allows us to look at changes in depression across time. There has been longstanding interest and discussion of seasonal patterns of depression, with observations of seasonal depressive patterns apparent in ancient times, and the first systematic description occurring in 1984 (Westrin and Lam, 2007). Commonly called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), the DSM-V now refers to this pattern as recurrent major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern.

Such a tool could allow for more frequent and fine grained (i.e., continuously scored) assessment and could provide contextualized information (e.g. specific words and online activities that are contributing to the user’s depression score). Here, we predict and characterize one’s degree of depression (DDep) based on their language use in Facebook. Datasets connecting surveyed depression with language in Facebook are rare at best. To operationalize DDep, we use the depression facet scores of the “Big 5” item pool (Goldberg, 1999) from the MyPersonality dataset. This provides a continuous value outcome, for which we fit a regression model based on ngrams, LDA topics, and lexica usage. By predicting continuous values, rather than classes, one can track changes in DDep of varying size across time; we find significantly more users’ DDep increases from summer to winter than vice-versa. Our primary contribution is the exploration of predicting continuous-valued depression scores from individuals’ social media messages.

Users wrote on average of 4,236 words (69,917,624 total word instances), and a subset of 16,507 users provided gender and age, in which 57.0% were female and the mean age was 24.8. The dataset was divided into training and testing samples. In particular, the testing sample consisted of a random set of 1000 users who wrote at least 1000 words and completed the personality measure, while the training set contained the 27,749 remaining users.

One related explanation for the photoperiod effect is latitude, with the prevalence of seasonal depression increasing with growing distance from the equator.

Such symptoms are reflected in words such as ‘tired’, and ‘sleep’. Depression is often expressed somatically through bodily symptoms, captured through ‘hurt’, ‘my head’ and ‘pain’. One of the most predictive questions on depressive screening questionnaires asks about suicidal thought, which appears with topics related to thoughts of death, with words such as ‘kill’, ‘die’, and ‘dying’. Topics also reflected hostility, aggression, and negative relationships with other people. Loneliness has emerged as one of the strongest predictors of physical morbidity and mortality (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010), and both ‘lonely’ and ‘alone’ appear as some of the most correlated single words. Given such striking descriptive results, future work might try to detect depression associFigure 5: Top ten topics most positively correlated with depression (from r = .14 at top to r = .11 at bottom).

Some items on these scales overlap with self-reported items that screen for depression (e.g., personality item: “I am often down in the dumps”; depression screening item: “how often have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?”; see Table 1.), such that the personality items effectively provide a proxy measure of depressive tendencies. 2.2 Related Work Depression has been linked with many online behaviors. In fact, even Internet usage itself seems to vary as a function of being depressed(Katikalapudi et al., 2012). Other behaviors include social networking (Moreno et al., 2011) and differences in location sharing on Facebook (Park et al., 2013). Most related to our work, are those using linguistic features to assess various measures of depression. For example, De Choudhury et al. (2013) used online posting behavior, network characteristics, and linguistic features when trying to predict depression rather than find its correlates. They used crowdsourcing to screen Twitter users with the CES-D test (Beekman et al., 1997), while others analyzed one year of Facebook status updates for DSM diagnostic criter</context>

As noted previously, assessing degree of depression as a continuous value allows us to look at changes in depression across time. There has been longstanding interest and discussion of seasonal patterns of depression, with observations of seasonal depressive patterns apparent in ancient times, and the first systematic description occurring in 1984 (Westrin and Lam, 2007).

Prevalence rates vary; the World Health Organization estimates that over 350 million people worldwide have a depressive disorder, with many more reporting at least some symptoms (Organization, 2012). In the U.S., in the World Health Mental Survey, over half of the respondents (62%) endorsed at least one diagnostic stem questions for depression, with 19.2% meeting criteria for at least one major depressive episode (Kessler et al., 2010).

We use the “depression facet” scores derived from a subset of the “big-5” personality items. Specifically, depression is one of several facets (e.g. anger, depression, anxiety, selfconsciousness, impulsiveness, vulnerability) of the neuroticism personality factor. Neuroticism refers to individual differences in the tendency to experience negative, distressing emotions, and behavioral and cognitive styles that result from this (McCrae and John, 1992). It includes traits such as tension, depression, frustration, guilt, and selfconsciousness, and is associated with low selfesteem, irrational thoughts and behaviors, ineffective coping styles, and somatic complaints. Various scales have been developed to measure neuroticism, such as the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975) and the NEO-PI-R (Costa and McCrae, 1992). Some items on these scales overlap with self-reported items that screen for depression (e.g., personality item: “I am often down in the dumps”; depression screening item: “how often have you been feeling do</context>

In fact, even Internet usage itself seems to vary as a function of being depressed(Katikalapudi et al., 2012). Other behaviors include social networking (Moreno et al., 2011) and differences in location sharing on Facebook (Park et al., 2013). Most related to our work, are those using linguistic features to assess various measures of depression. For example, De Choudhury et al.

(2013) classified which newfound mothers would suffer from postpartum depression. 3 Predicting Degree of Depression 3.1 Method Dataset. We used a dataset of 28,749 nonclinical users who opted into a Facebook application (“MyPersonality”; Kosinski and Stillwell, 2012) between June 2009 and March 2011, completed a 100-item personality questionnaire (an International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) proxy to the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg, 1999), and shared access to their status updates containing at least 50</context>

Depression can range from mild to severe, and can occur as an acute episode (major depressive episode), extend chronically over time (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder), reoccur after a period of remission (recurrent depression), or occur at specific periods (seasonal affective disorder, postpartum depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder). Prevalence rates vary; the World Health Organization estimates that over 350 million people worldwide have a depressive disorder, with many more reporting at least some symptoms (Organization, 2012). In the U.S., in the World Health Mental Survey, over half of the respondents (62%) endorsed at least one diagnostic stem questions for depression, with 19.2% meeting criteria for at least one major depressive episode (Kessler et al., 2010). Although depression has long been defined as a single disease with a set of diagnostic criteria, it often occurs comorbidly with other psychological and physical disorders. Anxiety, anger, and other psychological disorders often co-occur with depression, and some have suggested that anxiety and depression are different manifestations of the same underlyin</context>

In fact, even Internet usage itself seems to vary as a function of being depressed(Katikalapudi et al., 2012). Other behaviors include social networking (Moreno et al., 2011) and differences in location sharing on Facebook (Park et al., 2013). Most related to our work, are those using linguistic features to assess various measures of depression. For example, De Choudhury et al. (2013) used online posting behavior, network characteristics, and linguistic features when trying to predict depression rather than find its correlates. They used crowdsourcing to screen Twitter users with the CES-D test (Beekman et al., 1997), while others analyzed one year of Facebook status updates for DSM diagnostic critera of a Major Depressive Episode (Moreno et al., 2011).

One related explanation for the photoperiod effect is latitude, with the prevalence of seasonal depression increasing with growing distance from the equator.

Although latitude may play some role, other factors such as climate, genetic vulnerability, and the sociocultural context may have a stronger impact. Altogether, inconsistent results suggest that there is considerable variation in the magnitude, causes and manifestations of seasonal depression, much of which is not fully understood, in part due to diagnostic issues (Lam and Levitan, 2000).

As noted previously, assessing degree of depression as a continuous value allows us to look at changes in depression across time. There has been longstanding interest and discussion of seasonal patterns of depression, with observations of seasonal depressive patterns apparent in ancient times, and the first systematic description occurring in 1984 (Westrin and Lam, 2007). Commonly called Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), the DSM-V now refers to this pattern as recurrent major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern. A clinical diagnosis of seasonal depression requires that two major depressive episodes have occurred in the past two years, with the onset and remission showing a regular temporal pattern (predominantly with onset occurring in the fall/winter and full remission in spring/summer). Patients with depression often have common symptoms of low energy, reduced or intensified psychomotor movements, low concentration, indecisiveness, and thoughts of </context>

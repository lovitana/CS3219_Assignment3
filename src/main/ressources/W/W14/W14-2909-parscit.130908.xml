Events are not a discrete linguistic phe-
nomenon. Different verbal and nomi-
nal predicates express different degrees of
eventiveness. In this paper we analyze
the qualities that contribute to the over-
all eventiveness of a predicate, that is,
what makes a predicate an event. We
provide an in-depth analysis of seven key
qualities, along with experimental assess-
ments demonstrating their contributions.
We posit that these qualities are an impor-
tant part of a functional working definition
of events.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.998243185185185">
The problem of event extraction is fundamentally
challenging because many definitions of “event”
exist. Some predicates clearly indicate events, e.g.
“I ran 5 miles to the store”, while others indi-
cate states, e.g. “He is tall”. However, in nat-
ural language text, many predicates fall between
these two extremes, e.g. “He runs frequently”. In
order to successfully extract events, resolve event
coreference across documents, and reason about
the events, we must understand exactly what an
event is. In this paper, we propose a series of qual-
ities that contribute to the overall eventiveness of
a predicate. We define eventiveness as “the degree
to which a predicate is like an event?”.
The concept of “event” is not discrete, but exists
along several dimensions. We identify seven qual-
ities of predicates that lead readers to more readily
consider them to be events. In order to success-
fully utilize events in end applications, we believe
these qualities must be fully understood.
In this paper, we consider the predicate to be the
word (e.g. verb or noun) in the sentence that might
indicate the existence of an event. This is also re-
ferred to as a trigger or anchor in event extraction.
Each of the predicates in the following examples
(indicated by italics) exhibit different degrees of
eventiveness.

<listItem confidence="0.9927835">
1. The tremors have re-awakened bitter memo-
ries of the Asian tsunami that killed 168,000.
2. Indonesia lies in a zone where the plates shift,
sometimes generating tsunamis.
3. Electricity was cut off to the city, where peo-
ple fled their homes fearing a tsunami.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950806451613">
The first example is most clearly an event, refer-
ring to a specific instance of a tsunami. In the sec-
ond sentence, the nominal predicate “tsunamis”
refers to a non-specific event that occurs as a re-
sult a natural occurrence. In the third, a tsunami
has not occurred but is a feared possibility.
Any end application of extracted events must
decide which of these predicates to consider as rel-
evant. An application to “map known tsunamis”
might only consider the first event as relevant. An
application to detect newsworthy or “emerging”
events might only consider the third. An applica-
tion seeking to understand relationships between
events could utilize the second example to deter-
mine that plates shifting causes tsunamis. In or-
der to facilitate a wide range of applications, all of
these predicates should be extracted as “events”,
which can then be separated by the qualities they
possess. Furthermore, consideration of these qual-
ities should reflect human judgment about events.
In this paper, we discuss the different qualities
that contribute to the eventiveness of a predicate.
In Section 2, we describe previous work on defin-
ing events. In Section 3, we describe the quali-
ties that we consider to be most representative of
events. In Section 4, we describe an experiment
we conducted to rate these qualities in terms of
how they contribute to eventiveness. In Section
5, we conclude with a summary of our theory of
events and a description of how this will aid appli-
cations in understanding events.

There have been significant efforts to understand
the idea of “events” in a variety of different com-
munities, including physics, philosophy, psychol-
ogy, and both theoretical and computational lin-
guistics. We draw our qualities of eventiveness
from across this literature in order to form a more
complete view of what an event is.
Quine (1985) considers an event to be a well-
individuated physical object which is clearly de-
fined in space and time. This contrasts with the
TimeML schema (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), which
regards event as a “a cover term for situations that
happen or occur”. Lombard (1986) considers an
event to necessarily be a change. These defini-
tions by themselves do not sufficiently explain the
full boundary between event and non-event, but
are useful in informing our qualities.
In addition to TimeML, a pragmatic definition
of events was also adopted for ACE (2005). ACE
utilized a wide definition of event, though only a
small set of event types were annotated, along with
their specificity, actuality, and arguments. More
recently, TAC KBP (2014) has built on the ACE
definition in order to extract event information to
incorporate into a knowledge base.
Understanding how events are perceived by in-
dividuals has also been researched by psycholo-
gists in order to learn how people construct mental
models of events. Radvansky and Zacks (2011) in-
vestigate the mental representation of an event and
how this encompasses the event’s spatiotemporal
location, the people and objects involved, and the
relations between these elements. A working def-
inition of events should consider these psycholog-
ical conceptions.
The problem of understanding specific events
is closely related to that of event identity, which
considers whether two events mentioned in text
are regarded as the same. Many of the defini-
tions of event identity found in literature (e.g. Be-
jan and Harabagiu, 2010) were established to fa-
cilitate event coreference. Hovy et al. (2013)
move beyond exact event coreference to consider
the notion of quasi-identity. Quasi-identity refers
to events which are the same in some respects,
but not in others. We believe that definitions of
events that restrict certain qualities are not effec-
tive for informing the quasi-identity relationship.
For example, generic events can inform specific
instances of that event type.
In the field of theoretical linguistics, there are
many concepts that contribute to the idea of
eventiveness, including aktionsart and transitiv-
ity. Vendler (1957) introduced the classification
of verbs into different aspectual (aktionsart) cate-
gories, including accomplishments, achievements,
activities, and states. The first three categories
all correspond with the idea of events, though to
varying degrees. In distinguishing between events
and states, Comrie (1976) discusses the important
factor that states do not require energy to main-
tain, while events do. Also, Talmy (2000) and
Croft (2012) discuss at length the related notion
of force-dynamic relations, which deals with the
transmission of force between participants.
Additionally, there exists a significant overlap
between the dimensions of grammatical transitiv-
ity (as a prototypical notion) and the qualities that
define events. The concept of transitivity has been
researched extensively within the linguistics com-
munity, primarily with the goal of understanding
grammatical relationships within clauses.
Hopper and Thompson (1980) propose ten dif-
ferent dimensions intended to measure the notion
of transitivity, which the authors define as a prop-
erty of a clause that communicates how effectively
an action is “transferred” or “carried-over” from
agent to patient. The more effectively the activity
can be carried over, the higher the transitivity.
Although Hopper and Thompson suggest that
there is no single semantic notion that encom-
passes the nature of transitivity, they state that they
have considered terms such as ’activity’ and ’in-
tensity’, both of which are also relevant to the no-
tion of eventiveness. Tsunoda (1981; 1985) adds
several dimensions to the notion of transitivity as
a prototype which we believe further support the
relationship between transitivity and eventiveness,
including genericity, completion, and realization.
Experimental work was conducted by Madnani
et al. (2010) to collect information about subjects’
perception of the various transitivity dimensions
for given actions. However, the authors do not ex-
amine the transitivity dimensions of mode (realis
vs. irrealis), agency, and individuation of the ob-
ject, all of which we regard as also playing a very
important part in a predicate’s measure of “even-
tiveness”. Additionally, they guide the subjects
through the process of measuring transitivity by
prompting them for specific properties, as opposed
to utilizing human intuition.

Given the wide array of definitions and descrip-
tions of events from different perspectives, we be-
lieve that each offers a unique insight into this
multi-faceted problem. We seek to identify the
qualities of eventiveness and determine which are
the most salient. The seven qualities we consider
are listed in Table 1. In this section, we provide a
detailed definition, examples, and justification as
to why each quality is important to eventiveness.
For our examples, we consider predicates with
explicit textual indicators of the qualities. How-
ever, many predicates can possess these qualities
independent of textual evidence. Additionally, al-
though every quality is examined in isolation here,
the interaction between these qualities is an im-
portant consideration. In Section 4, we describe
the experiment we conducted in order to demon-
strate the extent to which each quality contributes
to eventiveness.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994145">
3.1 Occurrence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99280524137931">
Occurrence, the idea of something having hap-
pened, largely coincides with what we believe to
be an event. In fact, the TimeML definition (Puste-
jovsky et al., 2003) of event covers situations that
“happen or occur”. We consider this to be equiv-
alent to the idea of “change in the state of the
world”, because if the final state is the same as
the initial state, then nothing can be said to have
happened or occurred. As such, we contend that
the greater the degree to which an event can be
considered to have “happened” or “occurred”, the
greater the amount of eventiveness it will exhibit.
Note that the determination of ‘state’ here goes
beyond mere appearances: a person who bounces
a ball and catches it appears to be in exactly the
same state as before, but in reality, some energy
has been expended. Most verbs exhibit the qual-
ity of having “occurred”, with the notable excep-
tion of statives1, which are a fairly lexically con-
1Note that TimeML has a special class of events marked
as STATE.
strained category ( copular verbs, many verbs of
cognition, etc.). Thus, for verbal predicates, we
can regard verbs that indicate an action rather than
a state as having “occurred” and being eventive.
In general, the more energy and motion involved
in the predicate, the more eventive it is. In the ex-
ample below, running would be considered more
eventive than sitting.

<listItem confidence="0.9989575">
1. He was running on the track. (high energy)
2. He was sitting in the chair. (low energy)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999878142857143">
For nominal events, the situation is more com-
plicated. We must distinguish the set of nouns that
can indicate an event, such as “earthquake”, from
the set of nouns which cannot, such as “epicen-
ter”. For deverbal nouns, we also must distinguish
between process nouns, such as “the building of
the house”, and result nouns, as in “the building I
work in”. In order to distinguish the quality of oc-
currence, we can use the diagnostic of determining
whether the predicate can be appropriately associ-
ated with words such as “happened”, “took place”,
or “occurred”. For example, a presentation event
can “occur”, but the physical materials also called
the presentation cannot be said to have “occurred”.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999399">
3.2 Spatio-Temporal Grounding
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949071428571">
Spatio-temporal grounding deals with the degree
to which an event is able to be “pinpointed” to
a particular time and place. We hypothesize that
a predicate that is more able to be grounded in
time and/or space will be perceived as being more
eventive than a predicate which is less able to be
grounded spatio-temporally.
Quine (1985) considers events to be individu-
ated by their placement in space and time, which
implies that any given event should be able to be
associated with both a time and a place. Indeed,
the close association of events with their locations
and times manifests itself in our ability to refer
to well-known events by their time or location,

such as Chernobyl or 9/11. Another consequence
of the spatio-temporal grounding of events is that
one can refer to events that happen relative to other
events, e.g. before, after, nearby. Of the following
examples, the last seems most eventive.

3. He fought the law yesterday in court.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999559">
3.3 Lexical Aspect
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998650970588235">
Lexical aspect deals not with when a predicate oc-
curs in relation to time (i.e. tense), but how. It
examines, as Comrie (1976) puts it, “the internal
temporal constituency of a situation”. This covers
both how the event is bounded in time (telicity)
and how long it lasts (durativity). A durative event
can allow for increased eventiveness in that it al-
lows for more changes in the state of the world
simply because it lasts longer. At the same time,
many punctual (instantaneous) events have the po-
tential to be very eventive because they can pro-
duce large amounts of change in a very short time,
therefore producing a more drastic change (e.g. an
assassination or fatal lightning strike). Thus, both
durative and non-durative events seem to be able
to contribute to eventiveness in unique ways.
Regarding telicity, we believe that events which
are bounded in time (i.e. having endpoints) gen-
erally evoke a more pronounced sense of even-
tiveness because they are more easily distinguish-
able from the “backdrop” of other occurrences and
states. In fact, it is by definition that all events
must have a beginning (otherwise, they would not
be able to be referred to as “occurrences”), and we
believe that event endings or markers of comple-
tion move an event even closer to a prototypical
notion of “high eventiveness”.
Vendler (1957) categorizes verbs into four cat-
egories depending on their durativity and telic-
ity: state, achievement (telic, punctual), accom-
plishment (telic, durative), activity (atelic, dura-
tive). Comrie (1976) adds to this the category of
semelfactive (atelic, punctual). Examples of these
categories follow.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99883075">
1. He is building a house. (telic, durative)
2. He is swimming. (atelic, durative)
3. He shot the man. (telic, punctual)
4. He is knocking on the door. (atelic, punctual)
</listItem>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.96986">
3.4 Agency
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9965922">
Agency deals with the amount of control and vo-
lition involved in an event. We regard agency as a
measure of the degree to which a participant will-
fully executes an action and maintains control over
it. As such, we assert that the greater the degree
of agency attributed to the causer or performer of
an predicate, the higher the eventiveness that the
predicate will display. Involved in this idea are
the related notions of frequency/normalcy of oc-
currence and causality. Consider the following.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.982129666666667">
1. The wine aged in a barrel. (no agent)
2. The vintner aged the wine in a barrel. (agent:
vintner)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999974527777778">
The presence of the agent causes the second
predicate to seem more eventive than the first. The
first implies a natural process. The second implies
a volitional effort on the part of the vintner (the
agent) to cause the wine to undergo this process in
a particular location, likely with some control over
when the aging would begin and end before being
bottled. The relevance of these predicates to many
applications is dependent on the existence of the
agent.
Dowty (1991) lists prototypical characteristics
of high and low agency. For high agency, he
lists volition, sentience, effect upon another partic-
ipant, and self-produced mobility. For low agency,
he lists internal change, incremental theme (when
something incrementally disappears or is used up),
and movement induced by another participant.
We can describe “natural processes” as those
occurrences which come about as a result of ac-
tions whose main participants are characterized by
low agency. Most natural processes, such as “ag-
ing”, are not considered very eventive. However,
distinct from these are certain natural occurrences
that do involve movement and great effect on the
world (such as earthquakes, lightning, and land-
slides).
We also hypothesize that the frequency or “nor-
malcy” of predicates is related to the degree to
which they are perceived as eventive. The growth
of grass (low agency) is an extremely frequent and
“normal” type of process (and thus should be seen
as less eventive), whereas an earthquake (higher
agency) is a much rarer occurrence and should
therefore be seen as more eventive. Note that this
factor is also highly relevant to the “newsworthi-
ness” of the predicate.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996317">
62
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922625">
Agency is also intricately linked to causality,
since prototypical agents often cause a change of
state in patients. In many cases, the agent of a par-
ticular event can itself be characterized as an event
(e.g. “The earthquake caused three buildings to
crumble”). In this example, the earthquake - while
formally the agent of the “crumble” event - is itself
considered to be an event.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.881811">
3.5 Affectedness
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9956284">
Affectedness is the degree to which an event af-
fects its participants, most importantly the partic-
ipant in the semantic patient role of the predicate.
We generally hypothesize that the more affected
a patient is by the event it is a participant of, the
greater the eventiveness of that predicate.
The actual manifestation of the notion of “af-
fectedness” can take a variety of forms. First,
we posit that an event can affect its patient to a
greater extent if the patient is more animate. To
this end, we consider a general animacy hierarchy
that is a modification of the hierarchy proposed by
Silverstein (1976): Human Proper Noun &gt; Hu-
man Common Noun &gt; Animate Noun &gt; Inanimate
Noun, e.g. Sheila &gt; woman &gt; bear &gt; rock.
Second, we suggest that an event can affect its
patient to a greater extent if the action that is tak-
ing place is more severe or extreme. For example,
we would consider “He killed the man” to be more
eventive than “He wounded the man”, simply be-
cause of the longer-lasting effect of “kill”.
Both of these notions are grounded in Hop-
per and Thompson’s (1980) transitivity dimen-
sions of Individuation of O and Affectedness of O,
where O generally represents the semantic patient.
They contend that a particular action is able to be
“more effectively transferred” to a highly individ-
uated patient (one that is a proper noun, human
or animate, concrete, singular, count, and referen-
tial/definite) than to a patient that is low in individ-
uation (one that is common, inanimate, abstract,
plural, mass, and non-referential). We believe that
eventiveness has a direct correlation with patient
individuation in all dimensions but one: the sin-
gular vs. plural distinction. We contend that all
other things being equal, the broader the seman-
tic patient role is, the greater the overall effect of
the event (e.g. He killed five men as opposed to
He killed one man), and therefore the greater the
eventiveness.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999561">
1. He punched some pillows. (low individuation)
2. He punched his brother. (high individuation)
3. He bruised the man’s leg. (low affectedness)
4. He broke the man’s leg. (high affectedness)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998765">
Tsunoda (1981) notes that this affectedness is
independent of the amount of agency the agent
possesses: a person killed by a stray bullet is just
as affected as a person who is intentionally killed.
Our experiment in this study tests primarily for
individuation, and further testing is required to
specifically examine Hopper and Thompson’s af-
fectedness of O dimension. Additionally, future
studies could examine Tsunoda’s (1981) claim
that resultative predicates (e.g. break, kill) gener-
ally encode higher transitivity than non-resultative
predicates (e.g. hit, shoot). We believe that such
predicates should exhibit higher eventiveness be-
cause they lexically explicate the change in the
world that has taken place as a result of an ac-
tion. Similarly, future experiments could consider
not only the patient, but also how the agent and/or
other participants are affected by the action.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.973242">
3.6 Specificity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999925142857143">
Specificity can be defined as the degree to which
a predicate refers to a particular instance (or
instances) of an event, where that event must
be well-grounded in time and space and well-
individuated from other events. We believe that
as specificity of a predicate increases, eventive-
ness increases as well. Thus, specific events
should have higher eventiveness than habitual
events (ones that recur but do not have a well-
defined spatio-temporal location and/or number of
occurrences), and generic events (where no spe-
cific instance is in focus).
While both habitual and generic predicates are
less eventive, they differ in several ways. Habitual
events typically imply that instances of the event
have occurred, but with no specific information
about these occurrences, whereas generic predi-
cates refer to events that are treated more as gen-
eral classes of occurrences in the world rather than
individuated events. The following examples il-
lustrate this quality.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997421666666667">

2. The chicken lays two eggs a week. (habitual)

As noted in the example in the introduction, ha-
bitual and generic events are of great value for ac-
quiring world knowledge that can apply to specific

instances of those events. We consider this task to
be very similar to detecting when two events share
quasi-identity (Hovy et al., 2013). In the above ex-
ample, the habitual event gives a likely next date
for egg laying, and the generic event gives us the
knowledge that the chicken is fertile and therefore
able to lay eggs.
We also hypothesize that the more specific
the event (e.g. lays an egg on Tuesdays and
Fridays rather than lays two eggs a week), the
more eventive the predicate will seem. This in-
tuition connects with recent research into detect-
ing the difference between habitual and specific
events (Mathew and Katz, 2009), where the exis-
tence of semantic arguments to the predicate con-
tributes to specificity. Often, arguments missing
from generic events would display other properties
of eventiveness (e.g., agency or spatio-temporal
grounding) if they were present.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.955384">
3.7 Actuality
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999775470588235">
Actuality refers to whether an action is realis or ir-
realis, that is, whether or not it actually occurs. We
regard actualized (realis) predicates as exhibiting
a higher eventiveness than unactualized (irrealis)
predicates, as the former present actual changes in
the state of the world, whereas the latter posit only
potential or hypothetical changes.
The notion of whether or not a predicate is ac-
tualized corresponds to the “Effectiveness Con-
dition” parameter of realization (Tsunoda, 1981)
in transitivity theory. A predicate’s fulfillment of
the Effectiveness Condition generally correlates to
a greater “completeness” of lexical meaning and
also corresponds to a higher degree of affectedness
of the patient.
There are a wide variety of contexts in which
irrealis predicates can occur; among these, pred-
icates may be modified by epistemic modality
(might have), deontic modality (hopes, orders,
promises), abilities (is able to), and negative polar-
ity (didn’t). We also consider future tense events
to be irrealis, as by definition they have not yet oc-
curred. It should be noted that epistemic events
exist between realis and irrealis, and may exhibit
more eventiveness than other forms of modality.
Within the class of negative events, we can con-
trast simple negation events (events modified by
negators such as no and not) with avoided or pre-
vented events. Avoided events involve a conscious
decision (thus requiring agency) to not perpetrate
the event. Prevented events, on the other hand, in-
volve an external agent preventing the event from
occurring. In general, the act of preventing an
event from occurring is itself an event.

Typically, systems which utilize events concen-
trate on realis events only; however, when deal-
ing with events across documents, the information
associated with irrealis predicates is very useful
for establishing quasi-identity relationships. There
are several motivating examples of unactualized
event types that are necessary for deeper under-
standing of events. If a crime occurs, for instance,
a particular suspect’s ability to commit that crime
becomes relevant. Likewise, if some order is given

In order to perform a concrete analysis of the qual-
ities of eventiveness in the real world, we under-
took a small experiment in which human partici-
pants rated the eventiveness of different predicates
in context. We hypothesize that a predicate with an
explicit indicator of one of these qualities would
be considered more eventive than a similar predi-
cate without that indicator.

4.1 Methodology
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996925">
For each quality, we created one sentence with and
one without explicit evidence of that quality. The
two sentences utilize the same predicate and differ
only in their expression of the quality of interest.
For example, “He graduated college” possesses
the positive actuality quality, while “He promised
to graduate college” does not. This allows us to
compare the ratings for these pairs of sentences.
The sentences were placed into example groups
consisting of a pseudo-random sampling of the
sentences, enforced to only have one instance of a
predicate within each group. Each example group

of nine example groups.
We collected the eventiveness ratings from par-
ticipants on Amazon Mechanical Turk, who rated
each predicate in the example group on an inte-
ger scale from one to five. We collected 50 ratings
for each sentence, and participants were allowed
to complete multiple example groups. Overall, we
had 76 unique participants, who completed an av-
erage of 5.9 example groups each. The partic-
ipants spent an average of 9 seconds rating the
predicate in each sentence.
We also included a variety of control “non-
events”, which included result nouns as well as
statives. These exhibited statistically lower even-
tiveness than any of the non-control predicates.

non-events. One of the non-events was a stative

4.2 Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.976841409090909">
For our analysis, we examined the mean, variance,
and ranking of the eventiveness ratings provided
for each predicate by the participants. We com-
pared pairs of sentences2 based on the probabil-
ity that a randomly chosen rating for the sentence
with the quality would be higher than a randomly
chosen rating for the sentence without the quality.
2A complete list is available by request.
The statistical significance of this probability can
be assessed using a Wilcoxin-Mann-Whitney test.
For example, “He played piano” has a mean
eventiveness rating of x=4.56, Q=.80, and “He is
able to play piano” has x=3.82, Q=1.35. A ran-
dom rating for played is 66.3% more likely to be
higher than one for the ability play. This differ-
ence is statistically significant assuming an accept-
able type-I error rate of .05%.
We present in Table 3 results for the pairs of

ties. The &gt; indicates the hypothesis that one value

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999993857142857">
As shown in Table 3, many of the factors that have
been identified in various theoretical descriptions
of eventiveness can be shown experimentally to
affect people’s perception of the eventiveness of
a predicate in a sentence. Below, we discuss the
positive results, where our hypotheses were con-
firmed, as well as the negative results.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998727">

<bodyText confidence="0.999981169491525">
For occurrence, agency, and actuality, we found
strong evidence that these qualities contribute to
eventiveness. For example, “The attack happened
at dawn” was less eventive than “They attacked at
dawn”, “The fire started” was less eventive than
”He started the fire”, and “He hopes to gradu-
ate college” was less eventive than “He graduated
college”. For actuality, realis predicates were al-
ways more eventive than irrealis predicates. An
ANOVA test indicated no significant difference
between the different forms of irrealis (modality,
negation, etc.).
Results for the other qualities were slightly
more mixed. For aspect, we found that activities
were more eventive than achievements, but con-
trary to expectation, accomplishments were not
more eventive than activities. For specificity, there
was a clear distinction between specific and ha-
bitual predicates, but no distinction between spe-
cific and generic predicates. Our example of a
generic predicate, “Football fans watch the Super-
bowl” could be considered either a generic event
or a present tense description, and this might have
confused the results. Also, since the definition
provided for event gave only singular event exam-
ples, this may have biased the results in this case.
For spatio-temporal grounding, there was no
significant effect. We believe that this is due to
the implicit eventive nature of some verbs. We an-
alyzed the predicate “fought”, which was equally
eventive with and without a specified time or lo-
cation. However, such a verb does not require ex-
plicit grounding; the reader can assume that any
given fight happens at a specific time and location.
For affectedness, our examples utilized a verb that
is always highly indicative of affectedness and did
not adequately capture a good distinction between
high and low affectedness. We believe that future
experiments can control for these kinds of cases
and that example predicates can be found that will
isolate the specific qualities.
Another concern is that our design only explic-
itly tested a single predicate for each quality. How-
ever, the nature of the predicates and the sentences
we used allowed for post-hoc analysis of the qual-
ities that existed across more than two sentences.
Empirical testing showed the same pattern of re-
sults across predicates for these qualities.
Overall, the experimental results are extremely
interesting in their congruence with the literature
on events, but further research is required to deter-
mine the exact contribution of each quality. The
current experimental design lacks sufficient power
to reliably rank the qualities due to contrast effects
within example groups. It is likely that the order-
ing/grouping of the examples affected the rating of
individual examples. In future studies, we plan to
control for these effects by controlling the order-
ing of the examples given to each individual.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999950810810811">
Working definitions of events are often ill-defined
and difficult to apply. We have laid out a series
of qualities which contribute to the overall even-
tiveness of a predicate in a sentence. Our find-
ings indicate that the degree to which a predicate
is considered an event is a function of these qual-
ities. Evidence for these qualities was validated
using participant ratings of predicates.
When developing annotated corpora of events,
the decision of whether or not to consider an in-
dividual predicate as an event is difficult. Under-
standing the qualities of eventiveness can explain
why one predicate seems less eventive than an-
other (e.g. irrealis, generic).
Instead of deciding each predicate on the ba-
sis of the individual qualities being exhibited, an-
notation specifications should consider how these
qualities interact. Drawing an explicit boundary
between events and non-events can cause infor-
mation contained in the non-events to be lost for
reasoning. Along the same lines, event extrac-
tion capabilities could be greatly improved by the
labelling of these qualities on annotated corpora.
This would enable event extraction to preserve the
fine-grained distinctions between events that are
shown to be relevant to human understanding.
In this study, we gave examples of how pred-
icates with lesser eventiveness can provide valu-
able insight into problems such as event corefer-
ence and quasi-identity resolution. These qualities
of eventiveness can serve to inform future research
into those areas, providing a deeper understand-
ing of the meaning of event coreference. While
different applications have different needs, under-
standing the qualities that contribute to eventive-
ness will enable applications to more intelligently
utilize event information.

Quine (1985) considers an event to be a wellindividuated physical object which is clearly defined in space and time. This contrasts with the TimeML schema (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), which regards event as a “a cover term for situations that happen or occur”. Lombard (1986) considers an event to necessarily be a change. These definitions by themselves do not sufficiently explain the full boundary between event and non-event, but are useful in informing our qualities. In addition to TimeML, a pragmatic definition of events was also adopted for ACE (2005). ACE utilized a wide definition of event, though only a small set of event types were annotated, along with their specificity, actuality, and arguments. More recently, TAC KBP (2014) has built on the ACE definition in order to extract event information to incorporate into a knowledge base. Understanding how events are perceived by individuals has also been researched by psychologists in order to learn how people construct mental models of events.

Radvansky and Zacks (2011) investigate the mental representation of an event and how this encompasses the event’s spatiotemporal location, the people and objects involved, and the relations between these elements. A working definition of events should consider these psychological conceptions. The problem of understanding specific events is closely related to that of event identity, which considers whether two events mentioned in text are regarded as the same. Many of the definitions of event identity found in literature (e.g. Bejan and Harabagiu, 2010) were established to facilitate event coreference. Hovy et al. (2013) move beyond exact event coreference to consider the notion of quasi-identity. Quasi-identity refers to events which are the same in some respects, but not in others. We believe that definitions of events that restrict certain qualities are not effective for informing the quasi-identity relationship. For example, generic events can inform specific instances of that event type. In the field of theoretical linguistics, there are many concepts that contribute to the idea of eventiveness, including aktionsart and transitivity. Ve</context>

Another consequence of the spatio-temporal grounding of events is that one can refer to events that happen relative to other events, e.g. before, after, nearby. Of the following examples, the last seems most eventive. 1. He fought the law. 2. He fought the law yesterday. 3. He fought the law yesterday in court. 3.3 Lexical Aspect Lexical aspect deals not with when a predicate occurs in relation to time (i.e. tense), but how. It examines, as Comrie (1976) puts it, “the internal temporal constituency of a situation”. This covers both how the event is bounded in time (telicity) and how long it lasts (durativity). A durative event can allow for increased eventiveness in that it allows for more changes in the state of the world simply because it lasts longer. At the same time, many punctual (instantaneous) events have the potential to be very eventive because they can produce large amounts of change in a very short time, therefore producing a more drastic change (e.g. an assassination or fatal lightning strike). Thus, both durative and non-durativ</context>

In fact, it is by definition that all events must have a beginning (otherwise, they would not be able to be referred to as “occurrences”), and we believe that event endings or markers of completion move an event even closer to a prototypical notion of “high eventiveness”. Vendler (1957) categorizes verbs into four categories depending on their durativity and telicity: state, achievement (telic, punctual), accomplishment (telic, durative), activity (atelic, durative). Comrie (1976) adds to this the category of semelfactive (atelic, punctual). Examples of these categories follow. 1. He is building a house. (telic, durative) 2. He is swimming. (atelic, durative) 3. He shot the man. (telic, punctual) 4. He is knocking on the door. (atelic, punctual) 3.4 Agency Agency deals with the amount of control and volition involved in an event.

The vintner aged the wine in a barrel. (agent: vintner) The presence of the agent causes the second predicate to seem more eventive than the first. The first implies a natural process. The second implies a volitional effort on the part of the vintner (the agent) to cause the wine to undergo this process in a particular location, likely with some control over when the aging would begin and end before being bottled. The relevance of these predicates to many applications is dependent on the existence of the agent. Dowty (1991) lists prototypical characteristics of high and low agency. For high agency, he lists volition, sentience, effect upon another participant, and self-produced mobility. For low agency, he lists internal change, incremental theme (when something incrementally disappears or is used up), and movement induced by another participant. We can describe “natural processes” as those occurrences which come about as a result of actions whose main participants are characterized by low agency. Most natural processes, such as “aging”, are not considered very eventive. However, distinct from these are certain </context>

The problem of understanding specific events is closely related to that of event identity, which considers whether two events mentioned in text are regarded as the same. Many of the definitions of event identity found in literature (e.g. Bejan and Harabagiu, 2010) were established to facilitate event coreference. Hovy et al. (2013) move beyond exact event coreference to consider the notion of quasi-identity. Quasi-identity refers to events which are the same in some respects, but not in others. We believe that definitions of events that restrict certain qualities are not effective for informing the quasi-identity relationship. For example, generic events can inform specific instances of that event type.

The following examples illustrate this quality. 1. The chicken laid an egg on Tuesday. (specific) 2. The chicken lays two eggs a week. (habitual) 3. Chickens lay eggs when fertile. (generic) As noted in the example in the introduction, habitual and generic events are of great value for acquiring world knowledge that can apply to specific 63 instances of those events. We consider this task to be very similar to detecting when two events share quasi-identity (Hovy et al., 2013). In the above example, the habitual event gives a likely next date for egg laying, and the generic event gives us the knowledge that the chicken is fertile and therefore able to lay eggs. We also hypothesize that the more specific the event (e.g. lays an egg on Tuesdays and Fridays rather than lays two eggs a week), the more eventive the predicate will seem.

Tsunoda (1981; 1985) adds several dimensions to the notion of transitivity as a prototype which we believe further support the relationship between transitivity and eventiveness, including genericity, completion, and realization.

However, many predicates can possess these qualities independent of textual evidence. Additionally, although every quality is examined in isolation here, the interaction between these qualities is an important consideration. In Section 4, we describe the experiment we conducted in order to demonstrate the extent to which each quality contributes to eventiveness. 3.1 Occurrence Occurrence, the idea of something having happened, largely coincides with what we believe to be an event. In fact, the TimeML definition (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) of event covers situations that “happen or occur”. We consider this to be equivalent to the idea of “change in the state of the world”, because if the final state is the same as the initial state, then nothing can be said to have happened or occurred. As such, we contend that the greater the degree to which an event can be considered to have “happened” or “occurred”, the greater the amount of eventiveness it will exhibit. Note that the determination of ‘state’ here goes beyond mere appearances: a person who bounces a ball and catches it appears to be in exactly the same state as before, but i</context>

Overall, we had 76 unique participants, who completed an average of 5.9 example groups each. The participants spent an average of 9 seconds rating the predicate in each sentence. We also included a variety of control “nonevents”, which included result nouns as well as statives. These exhibited statistically lower eventiveness than any of the non-control predicates. 4.1.1 Instructions We provided instructions to each participant as shown in Table 2. These instructions contain a succinct definition of an event, utilizing the TimeML terminology (Pustejovsky et al., 2003). Additionally, we provided four example sentences, two illustrating events and two illustrating non-events. One of the non-events was a stative (“is”), and the other was a result noun (“Building”). These examples illustrate that not all verbs indicate events, and that words like “building” can be events in some contexts but not others. 4.2 Analysis For our analysis, we examined the mean, variance, and ranking of the eventiveness ratings provided for each predicate by the participants.

The presentation occurred in the boardroom. 2. *The presentation slides occurred. 3.2 Spatio-Temporal Grounding Spatio-temporal grounding deals with the degree to which an event is able to be “pinpointed” to a particular time and place. We hypothesize that a predicate that is more able to be grounded in time and/or space will be perceived as being more eventive than a predicate which is less able to be grounded spatio-temporally. Quine (1985) considers events to be individuated by their placement in space and time, which implies that any given event should be able to be associated with both a time and a place. Indeed, the close association of events with their locations and times manifests itself in our ability to refer to well-known events by their time or location, 61 such as Chernobyl or 9/11. Another consequence of the spatio-temporal grounding of events is that one can refer to events that happen relative to other events, e.g. before, after, nearby.

We generally hypothesize that the more affected a patient is by the event it is a participant of, the greater the eventiveness of that predicate. The actual manifestation of the notion of “affectedness” can take a variety of forms. First, we posit that an event can affect its patient to a greater extent if the patient is more animate. To this end, we consider a general animacy hierarchy that is a modification of the hierarchy proposed by Silverstein (1976): Human Proper Noun &gt; Human Common Noun &gt; Animate Noun &gt; Inanimate Noun, e.g. Sheila &gt; woman &gt; bear &gt; rock. Second, we suggest that an event can affect its patient to a greater extent if the action that is taking place is more severe or extreme. For example, we would consider “He killed the man” to be more eventive than “He wounded the man”, simply because of the longer-lasting effect of “kill”. Both of these notions are grounded in Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) transitivity dimensions of Individuation of O and Affectedness of O, where O generally represents the semantic patient.

We believe that eventiveness has a direct correlation with patient individuation in all dimensions but one: the singular vs. plural distinction. We contend that all other things being equal, the broader the semantic patient role is, the greater the overall effect of the event (e.g. He killed five men as opposed to He killed one man), and therefore the greater the eventiveness. 1. He punched some pillows. (low individuation) 2. He punched his brother. (high individuation) 3. He bruised the man’s leg. (low affectedness) 4. He broke the man’s leg. (high affectedness) Tsunoda (1981) notes that this affectedness is independent of the amount of agency the agent possesses: a person killed by a stray bullet is just as affected as a person who is intentionally killed. Our experiment in this study tests primarily for individuation, and further testing is required to specifically examine Hopper and Thompson’s affectedness of O dimension. Additionally, future studies could examine Tsunoda’s (1981) claim that resultative predicates (e.g. break, kill) generally encode higher transitivity than non-resultative predicates (e.g. hit, shoot).

We regard actualized (realis) predicates as exhibiting a higher eventiveness than unactualized (irrealis) predicates, as the former present actual changes in the state of the world, whereas the latter posit only potential or hypothetical changes. The notion of whether or not a predicate is actualized corresponds to the “Effectiveness Condition” parameter of realization (Tsunoda, 1981) in transitivity theory. A predicate’s fulfillment of the Effectiveness Condition generally correlates to a greater “completeness” of lexical meaning and also corresponds to a higher degree of affectedness of the patient. There are a wide variety of contexts in which irrealis predicates can occur; among these, predicates may be modified by epistemic modality (might have), deontic modality (hopes, orders, promises), abilities (is able to), and negative polarity (didn’t).

In fact, it is by definition that all events must have a beginning (otherwise, they would not be able to be referred to as “occurrences”), and we believe that event endings or markers of completion move an event even closer to a prototypical notion of “high eventiveness”. Vendler (1957) categorizes verbs into four categories depending on their durativity and telicity: state, achievement (telic, punctual), accomplishment (telic, durative), activity (atelic, durative).

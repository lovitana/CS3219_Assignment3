The paper presents a system for tran-
scribing and annotating phonological in-
formation in Brazilian Portuguese, in-
cluding syllabification. An application of
this system for the assessment of lan-

<bodyText confidence="0.999959514285714">
We present an application of a phonological-
prosodic algorithm which converts Brazilian Por-
tuguese graphemes to phonological symbols. For
a better understanding, a brief report about the
origin of the algorithm, altogether with some
theoretical comments are presented, before the
case study of the phonological processes found
in the speech samples of a child. Sessions were
recorded, until the complete acquisition of all
Portuguese phonemes by the child, which oc-
curred in the fifth session.
In 2008, we created the first version of a pho-
nological-prosodic algorithm for Brazilian Por-
tuguese. Actually, it is the functional algorithm
of the grapheme to phoneme converter Nhenhém
(Vasilévski, 2008, 2012a, 2012b). It has all writ-
ten Portuguese spelling rules, and also the entire
Portuguese prosodic system. When that algo-
rithm was built, we kept in mind its usefulness to
different fields deeply related to phonology, such
as speech therapy, allowing the study of children
phonological disorders, and language acquisition.
We focus here on its application to language
acquisition, allowing the study of children pho-
nological acquisition processes. Hence, our ob-
jective is to show the phonological-prosodic al-
gorithm usefulness to language survey, from a
practical point of view, by showing the process
involved in the last stages of the acquisition of
Portuguese phonology.
For a better understanding of the application
and of the case study, the paper starts with some
theory on phonological acquisition, then, some
aspects of Brazilian Portuguese acquisition are
presented.

2 Phonological Development
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999948928571429">
Studies of first language acquisition tend to sup-
port the view that the ability for language is in-
nate in healthy human beings, and that its ap-
pearance can be predicted as part of the normal
development of any child, given the right envi-
ronment (Beaken, 1971).
The greatest expansion of the phonological
system is observed from 1 year and six months
old up to 4 years old, when there is an increase of
the phonetic inventory of most complex syllable
structures and, therefore, a period characterized
by the occurrence of omissions, substitutions, as
well as other phonological processes (Wertzner,
2004).
A phonological process is a mental operation
that applies in speech to substitute, for a class of
sounds or sound sequences presenting a specific
common difficulty to the speech capacity of the
individual, an alternative class identical but lack-
ing the difficult property (Stampe, 1973).
It is worth remembering that, at the richest
stage of normal language development (1 year
and a half to 4 years old, as said), inappropriate
sound gestures are expected phonological proc-
esses that relate to children’s adaptations, until
they automate the adult speech patterns. Thus,
the phonological processes – that are natural and
inborn – guide the facilitation of complex vocal

gestures and their planning, until children reach
the adult performance.
Moreover, the early-acquired competence is
filtered through an increasing number of phono-
logical transformations to produce, finally, a ma-
ture performance. Although the mature phonemic
system is acquired at an early stage, articulation
may not be completely mature until after 7 years.
Even though most children can be said to have
mastered the complete set of potential phonemic
oppositions of adult language by the age of 4
years – in other words, their phonological com-
petence is established – yet, in adult terms, their
performance falls short of their competence, in
that they are unable to produce many of the ges-
tures of mature articulation of the phonemes.
Development after this stage takes place in the
maturing of articulation, and in the acquisition of
the complex transformations which operate on
the basic acquired competence, to produce forms
of speech similar to those heard from mature
speakers (Beaken, 1971).

2.1 Some Aspects of Brazilian Portuguese
Phonological Acquisition
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999832155172414">
Regarding phonemes, Brazilian Portuguese has
21 consonants (/p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /m/, /n/, /t/, /d/, /s/,
/z/, /l/, /�/, /r/, /x/, /f/, /3/, /p/, /k/, /g/, and the ar-
chiphonemes |R|, |S|), and 14 vowels (/a/, /e/, /e/,
/i/, /o/, /o/, /u/, /j/, /w/, /ã/, /6/, /i/, /õ/, /u/) (Scliar-
Cabral, 2003a; Câmara Jr., 1986, 1977; Va-
silévski, 2012a).
Lateral liquid phonemes /l/ and /V and non-
lateral liquid /r/ and /x/ are the latest to be ac-
quired in Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore,
such acquisition is marked by intense use of di-
versified phonological processes. What perhaps
justifies this late acquisition, in Brazilian Portu-
guese as well as in other systems, is that this
class is very complex, both in articulation and
phonological aspects (Lamprecht, 2004).
Within this group of sounds, lateral phonemes
are acquired before the non-lateral ones. The first
lateral phoneme to be stabilized by children is /l/,
which is subdued before the emergence of the
first non-lateral liquid phoneme /x/. This occurs
with the phonemes /V – graphically lh – and /r/,
being the first acquired before the second (Her-
nandorena and Lamprecht, 1997). In Portuguese,
the phoneme /r/ occurs: 1) forming a syllable
with an oral or nasal vowel (simple onset); 2) in
second position of inseparable consonant clus-
ters, preceding oral or nasal vowel (complex on-
set); and 3) in syllable ending (coda, when it is
the archiphoneme |R|). See Tab.1 for examples.
In most cases, the acquisition of the phoneme
/r/ happens initially in the position of simple on-
set (by 4 years old) and then in the position of
complex onset (by 5 years old), the acquisition of
the phoneme /r/ in coda position (that is, |R|) oc-
curs by 4 years old (Lamprecht, 2004) either.
Another linguistic phenomenon to be taken
into account is diphthongization. It happens
when one vowel breaks into two segments,
where the first one matches the original vowel
and the second (/j/ or /w/) is harmonic with the
nature of the triggering vowel. In Brazilian Por-
tuguese, one of the conditions when diphthongi-
zation occurs, and that matters here, is thus de-
fined: a stressed vowel, followed by a devoiced
alveolar fricative [s], in the ending syllable of a
word, becomes diphthongized by the addition of
a second segment, an [i] (Cagliari, 2002). Since
diphthongization is a strengthening process, it
occurs preferentially with strong vowels, and, in
Romance languages, /a/ is the strongest vowel,
and /i/, the weakest (Foley, 1977). The semivow-
els of stressed syllables can be either produced or
not in speech, both options belonging to Portu-
guese language system (Vasilévski, 2012a).
From the linguistic point of view, diphthongiza-
tion is strongly related to the geographical dia-
lectal variation (Leiria, 2000).

3 A Program for Helping Language
Acquisition Research
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999573636363636">
By using Nhenhém phonological-prosodic algo-
rithm, we built Nhenhém Fonoaud – NhFonoaud
–, an application for assisting speech therapy,
and so language acquisition. We began covering
just one phonological process, called “unvoiced-
ness”: a substitution of a voiced sound for an
unvoiced one (e.g. /b/ --). /p/) (Blasi and Va-
silévski, 2011). Soon, we realized that the phono-
logical-prosodic algorithm could cover much
more.
One of the motivations for creating such a
system is that many Brazilian language acquisi-
tion researchers record their collected data using
orthographic representation. As a result, those
transcriptions are idiosyncratic and cannot be
properly generalized, since they lack patterns.
Data must be recorded in a phonologic-phonetic
format, essential for these studies, since they ad-
dress phonological processes.
According to researchers and speech thera-
pists, there is no similar work in Brazilian Portu-
guese. Probably, there are similar initiatives for

other languages, and we expect to make com-
parisons soon.

3.1 The decoder Nhenh6m Phonological-
prosodic Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999809823529412">
Nhenh6m (/p6.&apos;p6j/) is a computational program
that decodes Brazilian’s official writing system
into phonological symbols and marks prosody
(Vasil6vski, 2008, 2012a). In 2010, we aug-
mented its main algorithm, so the system became
able of providing the phonological syllabic divi-
sion and the spelling syllabic division, with at
least 99% of accuracy (see Vasil6vski, 2012a,
2012b for more details). Then we developed an
automatic syllable parsing (Vasil6vski, 2010).
In 2012, we made some adjustments regarding
morphology, and solved the unpredictable situa-
tions brought, for example, by the prefix “trans-”
that can be either decoded as /trãz/ or /trãs/, in
consequence of resyllabification (see Vasil6vski,
2012a). NhFonoaud benefits of all improvements
obtained by the basic algorithm.

3.2 Nhenh6m Fonoaud
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999872645161291">
The application of Nhenh6m phonological-
prosodic algorithm to language acquisition and
speech therapy has been presented (Blasi and
Vasil6vski, 2011, Vasil6vski, 2012a, 2012b), but
this is the first time that a case study is discussed.
The first major challenge of working with
phonemic transcription is the consistency of data.
Different research questions require different
levels of representation (Albert et al., 2013). In
this regard, relying on an orthographic represen-
tation of speech, when dealing with language
acquisition, does not make sense.
The program supports the analysis of proc-
esses that occur in the child’s phonological sys-
tem, through the automatic phonological tran-
scription simultaneously to samples of the child
speech recording. Thus, data relies on a phone-
mic representation of speech, automatically done
by the algorithm, through Nhenh6m Fonoaud.
NhFonoaud is designed for dealing with pho-
nological tests, using words wittingly grouped to
analyze specific aspects of speech and phenom-
ena involved in its development. One of the tools
of the program was the tests battery called Re-
ception and Production of Spoken Language As-
sessment (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b). These tests
were elaborated for assessing overt symptoms of
spoken language reception and production prob-
lems. The first step is assessing phonetic features
perception, namely, the ability of distinguishing
minimal pairs, what means distinguishing Brazil-
ian Portuguese words.
The battery is composed by 81 pictures that
represent specific words in Portuguese. The pic-
tures are grouped into cards of six elements each.
There are 15 cards, and some pictures appear in
more than one. Each card is assembled to address
the perception and production of one specific
phonetic feature: 1) /v/-/f/, /p/-/b/, /t/-/d/; 2) /k/-
/g/, /f/-/3/, /s/-/z/; 3) /m/-/n/, /t/-/d/, /s/-/f/; 4) /b/-
/g/, /f/-/r/, /k/-/p/; 5) /t/-/k/, |R|-/s/, /l/-/V; 6) /t/-
/s/, /k/-|R|, /p/-/f/; 7) /d/-/t/, /t/-/r/, /d/-/s/; 8) /m/-
/b/, /n/-/r/, /z/-/n/; 9) /p/-/V, /d/-/n/, /n/-/l/; 10) /r/-
/l/ (in three different contexts); 11) /E/-/o/, /i/-/u/,
/e/-/o/; 12) /i/-/e/, /i/-/6/, /u/-/o/; 13) /e(j)/-/E/, /o/-
/o/, /o/-/o(w)/; 14) /o/-/a/, /m/-/b/ (in two different
contexts)/; 15) /6/-/e/, /o/-/õ/, /a/-/ã/.
In the reception battery, the speech therapist,
behind the child, says the word and the child
must point to one of the six pictures in each card.
In the production battery, the speech therapist
points to one of the six pictures in each card and
the child must label it.
While the child labels the picture, the re-
searcher can edit the canonical transcription pro-
vided by the program to match the child’s pro-
duction. For example, writing the lateral pho-
neme, when the child produces it, instead of the
vibrating one.
In principle, four situations may happen dur-
ing the assessment (Fig.1): the child does not
recognize the picture (NR); the child gives the

expected response (Correspondeu); the child
gives an unexpected response (deviation – Des-
vio); the child translates the word into his/her
sociolinguistic variety (not deviation – Sócio).
NhFonoaud stores the records and compares
them with the transcription expected, for generat-
ing reports. Hence, it is possible to build a cor-
pus, to retrieve it, grouping it according to date,
situation, child’s age, type of card (test); then it
is possible the conversion into numbers, using
different formats, comparing the phonological
transcription and the correspondent audio, and
the recorded sessions. Therefore, it facilitates
child’s progress monitoring.
In spite of working with words, NhFonoaud
can be adjusted to work with bigger texts,
formed by many sentences. For the purpose of
assessing the child phonemic system, using min-
imal pairs and small sentences is enough.

3.3 Testing Nhenhém Fonoaud
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99981485">
The data analysis that we now present refers to a
child in a clear process of language acquisition.
It is based on oral emissions of a girl that we will
call Inês. The 15 cards (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b)
were applied, covering all the Brazilian Portu-
guese phonemes. Five sessions were recorded,
starting when Inês was 2 years, 11 months, and 8
days; until she was 3 years, 8 months and 29
days.
Inês was born in Curitiba, Brazil, of Brazilian
parents. She was not considered to have signifi-
cant hearing loss. The child had developed some
computer skills. Data was collected by her par-
ents, by showing her the cards at the computer,
during a daily conversation. Inês had already
contact with the pictures, and had learned some
names that were not part of her daily life. The
sessions were recorded by using the audio re-
sources of the same computer, and the records
were clear enough to be used in this study.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997777">
3.3.1 Testing results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999315647058823">
The results reveal the phonological processes
used by Inês. Four were observed in her emis-
sions: two of substitution, one of deletion, and
one of adding. From the reports generated by
Nhenhém Fonoaud, we created Tab 1.
So, at the age of 2y11m8d, three phonological
processes relate to a single phoneme of her
mother tongue, the non-lateral, vibrating /r/, and
another one to diphthongization. Thus, Inês is
only unable to produce the most complex Portu-
guese phoneme, in anyone of the three cases in
which it occurs. The first session reveals that the
child is able to produce all the vowels (14) of her
mother tongue and 20 consonantal phonemes
among the 21 of Brazilian Portuguese. No
changes are observed for about 4 months, but
this is expected, since progress in language is

never regular; it may proceed at a fast rate for
some periods while at others very little seems to
be happening (Beaken, 1971). Then, the sound /r/
is emerging, only in simple onset, and she pro-
duces the cluster, but says /tl/ instead of /tr/
(3y6m25d). One month later (3y7m24d), she
starts producing /r/ in coda position and the clus-
ter /tr/, with some difficult yet. The sound /r/ in
simple onset is naturally produced. One more
month (3y8m29d), and she is able to naturally
produce /r/ in all the contexts it happens in Por-
tuguese, and keeps diphthongization.
Regarding diphthongization, it happens when
the child inserts the semivowel /j/ between a
vowel and the coda |S|, creating a diphthong.
This circumstance advises that the child is ad-
justing her speech according to adult speech,
since the region where Inês lives is where this
phonological phenomenon occurs most, consid-
ering the South of Brazil (Leiria, 2000). It is a
trait of the child’s sociolinguistic variety, de-
pendent upon geographic factor, and so she
keeps saying it.
Hence, this research found that Inês completed
the acquisition of the phonemes of her native
language at 3 years and 8 months approximately,
in normal development.

4 Conclusion and Outlooks

<bodyText confidence="0.999836333333333">
We briefly presented a system for dealing with
phonological information in Brazilian Portu-
guese, and a case study from it, that is, the lon-
gitudinal speech recording of a child – the girl
called Inês. Data allowed to know the last
processes involved in the acquisition of the
phonemes of her mother tongue.
From the preliminary results obtained, it is
possible to conclude that Nhenhém Fonoaud can
be helpful to language acquisition research. Nev-
ertheless, the usefulness of the phonological pro-
sodic algorithm has to be proven, by testing it in
different situations, such as deviant language
acquisition, speech therapy, and also other re-
searches. This will be our next step.

The first major challenge of working with phonemic transcription is the consistency of data. Different research questions require different levels of representation (Albert et al., 2013). In this regard, relying on an orthographic representation of speech, when dealing with language acquisition, does not make sense. The program supports the analysis of processes that occur in the child’s phonological system, through the automatic phonological transcription simultaneously to samples of the child speech recording. Thus, data relies on a phonemic representation of speech, automatically done by the algorithm, through Nhenh6m Fonoaud.

What perhaps justifies this late acquisition, in Brazilian Portuguese as well as in other systems, is that this class is very complex, both in articulation and phonological aspects (Lamprecht, 2004). Within this group of sounds, lateral phonemes are acquired before the non-lateral ones. The first lateral phoneme to be stabilized by children is /l/, which is subdued before the emergence of the first non-lateral liquid phoneme /x/. This occurs with the phonemes /V – graphically lh – and /r/, being the first acquired before the second (Hernandorena and Lamprecht, 1997). In Portuguese, the phoneme /r/ occurs: 1) forming a syllable with an oral or nasal vowel (simple onset); 2) in second position of inseparable consonant clusters, preceding oral or nasal vowel (complex onset); and 3) in syllable ending (coda, when it is the archiphoneme |R|). See Tab.1 for examples. In most cases, the acquisition of the phoneme /r/ happens initially in the position of simple onset (by 4 years old) and then in the position of complex onset (by 5 years old), the acquisition of the phoneme /r/ in coda position (that is, |R|) occurs by 4 years old (Lamprecht, 2004) either.

Regarding diphthongization, it happens when the child inserts the semivowel /j/ between a vowel and the coda |S|, creating a diphthong. This circumstance advises that the child is adjusting her speech according to adult speech, since the region where Inês lives is where this phonological phenomenon occurs most, considering the South of Brazil (Leiria, 2000). It is a trait of the child’s sociolinguistic variety, dependent upon geographic factor, and so she keeps saying it. Hence, this research found that Inês completed the acquisition of the phonemes of her native language at 3 years and 8 months approximately, in normal development. 4 Conclusion and Outlooks We briefly presented a system for dealing with phonological information in Brazilian Portuguese, and a case study from it, that is, the longitudinal speech recording of a child – the girl called Inês.

For a better understanding of the application and of the case study, the paper starts with some theory on phonological acquisition, then, some aspects of Brazilian Portuguese acquisition are presented. 2 Phonological Development Studies of first language acquisition tend to support the view that the ability for language is innate in healthy human beings, and that its appearance can be predicted as part of the normal development of any child, given the right environment (Beaken, 1971). The greatest expansion of the phonological system is observed from 1 year and six months old up to 4 years old, when there is an increase of the phonetic inventory of most complex syllable structures and, therefore, a period characterized by the occurrence of omissions, substitutions, as well as other phonological processes (Wertzner, 2004).

Development after this stage takes place in the maturing of articulation, and in the acquisition of the complex transformations which operate on the basic acquired competence, to produce forms of speech similar to those heard from mature speakers (Beaken, 1971). 2.1 Some Aspects of Brazilian Portuguese Phonological Acquisition Regarding phonemes, Brazilian Portuguese has 21 consonants (/p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /m/, /n/, /t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, /l/, /�/, /r/, /x/, /f/, /3/, /p/, /k/, /g/, and the archiphonemes |R|, |S|), and 14 vowels (/a/, /e/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /o/, /u/, /j/, /w/, /ã/, /6/, /i/, /õ/, /u/) (ScliarCabral, 2003a; Câmara Jr., 1986, 1977; Vasilévski, 2012a).

Lateral liquid phonemes /l/ and /V and nonlateral liquid /r/ and /x/ are the latest to be acquired in Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, such acquisition is marked by intense use of diversified phonological processes. What perhaps justifies this late acquisition, in Brazilian Portuguese as well as in other systems, is that this class is very complex, both in articulation and phonological aspects (Lamprecht, 2004). Within this group of sounds, lateral phonemes are acquired before the non-lateral ones. The first lateral phoneme to be stabilized by children is /l/, which is subdued before the emergence of the first non-lateral liquid phoneme /x/. This occurs with the phonemes /V – graphically lh – and /r/, being the first acquired before the second (Hernandorena and Lamprecht, 1997). In Portuguese, the phoneme /r/ occurs: 1) forming a syllable with an oral or nasal vowel (simple onset); 2) in second position of inseparable consonant clusters, preceding oral or nasal vowel (complex onset); and 3) in sylla</context>

Since diphthongization is a strengthening process, it occurs preferentially with strong vowels, and, in Romance languages, /a/ is the strongest vowel, and /i/, the weakest (Foley, 1977). The semivowels of stressed syllables can be either produced or not in speech, both options belonging to Portuguese language system (Vasilévski, 2012a).

Soon, we realized that the phonological-prosodic algorithm could cover much more. One of the motivations for creating such a system is that many Brazilian language acquisition researchers record their collected data using orthographic representation. As a result, those transcriptions are idiosyncratic and cannot be properly generalized, since they lack patterns. Data must be recorded in a phonologic-phonetic format, essential for these studies, since they address phonological processes. According to researchers and speech therapists, there is no similar work in Brazilian Portuguese. Probably</context>

For a better understanding, a brief report about the origin of the algorithm, altogether with some theoretical comments are presented, before the case study of the phonological processes found in the speech samples of a child. Sessions were recorded, until the complete acquisition of all Portuguese phonemes by the child, which occurred in the fifth session. In 2008, we created the first version of a phonological-prosodic algorithm for Brazilian Portuguese. Actually, it is the functional algorithm of the grapheme to phoneme converter Nhenhém (Vasilévski, 2008, 2012a, 2012b). It has all written Portuguese spelling rules, and also the entire Portuguese prosodic system. When that algorithm was built, we kept in mind its usefulness to different fields deeply related to phonology, such as speech therapy, allowing the study of children phonological disorders, and language acquisition. We focus here on its application to language acquisition, allowing the study of children phonological acquisition processes. Hence, our objective is to show the phonological-prosodic algorithm usefulness to language survey, from a practical point of view, by showing the pr</context>

<bodyText confidence="0.999679034482759">
This paper aims to highlight morphosyntactic
discrepancies encountered in representing the
adjective equivalent in African WordNet, with
reference to Northern Sotho. Northern Sotho is
an agglutinating language with rich and
productive morphology. The language also
features a disjunctive orthographic system. The
orthography determines the attachment
selection of morphemes. The immediate issue,
in this paper, is the absence of a one-to-one
correspondence between the adjective in
English and that in Northern Sotho. The
meaning equivalent of the English adjective
covers more than one morphosyntactic
category in Northern Sotho. In addition, the
categories’ structural diversity has a bearing on
representation considerations. In some of these
categories the stem suffices to represent the
specific category unambiguously while in
others there is a need to incorporate affixes
with the stem. The challenge is to categorize
semantic equivalents of the English adjective
as such, while retaining their separate
morphosyntactic tags in Northern Sotho, in
harmony with the typology of the language.
The present paper proposes morphologically
feasible ways of representing this varied
equivalent of the English adjective in Northern
Sotho.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791694444445">
African WordNet1 seeks to build WordNets for
all indigenous official languages of South Africa,
which will be linked to one another. Northern
Sotho2 is one of the languages in African
WordNet. So far in the project the work covers
the verbs, nouns, and few adjectives. This
presentation is based on the experiences with the
adjective in the project so far. Like many
languages African WordNet is expanded from
the Princeton WordNet3. Being cognisant of
dissimilar typologies of the source and target
languages, as well as language-specific cultural
and historical orientations, African WordNet is
geared towards customisation to the African
context.
The aim of this paper is to highlight
morphosyntactic discrepancies encountered with
the Northern Sotho equivalent of the adjective in
African WordNet. It also proposes
morphologically feasible ways in which the
equivalent can be represented. Synsets are
linked to one another through conceptual-
semantic and lexical relations. WordNet
therefore links together not only lexical items
but, more significantly, the senses that the lexical
items represent. It may be possible for a sense to
be lexicalised in both the source and the target
language without necessarily carrying the same
morphosyntactic tag. This presentation will not
go into the broad theoretical issues attending
adjectives; rather the focus will be on the
meaning equivalent of the English adjective in
Northern Sotho, which is the target language,
given typological differences between the two
languages and differences in morphological
structures of the equivalents in the target

language. Each morphosyntactic category in
Northen Sotho will be discussed separately and
will conclude with a proposed representation in
the database.
2 Semantic function of the adjective
English will be used as springboard here because
it is the source language for the expand approach
adopted for African WordNet. The semantic
function of the English adjective, be it attributive
or relational (Miller, 1978), is universal, namely
to modify the noun. Morphologically, apart from
the core adjectives which may also be
morphologically affected through inflection,
English adjectives include denominals and
deverbals (Peters and Peters, 2000). Furthermore,
there are also other different morphosyntactic
constructions that are used in modifying the
noun, such as the genitive and relative clause.
For the purpose of this presentation and in
context with African WordNet, the discussion
will be confined to the English lexical entry with
POS tag adjective, such as purple, murdered,
cute and little and how they are rendered in the
African WordNet.
The immediate issue, first of all, is the
absence of a one-to-one correspondence between
the adjective in English and that in Northern
Sotho (Poulos and Louwrens, 1994). Northern
Sotho has a limited number of adjectival stems,
which is by no means a reflection of the
language’s capacity to produce qualifications for
the noun. It is not always possible to use an
adjective to convey a concept in Northern Sotho
that is expressed by an English adjective.
Traditional Northern Sotho grammars identify
four morphosyntactic categories (the adjective,
descriptive possessive [genitive], relative and
enumerative) to perform this semantic function
(Ziervogel et al., 1969; Poulos and Louwrens
1994). Moreover, each of these equivalents of
the English adjective assumes a different prefix
depending on the class of the noun it modifies.
Some of the stems are unambiguous without
affixes and some need affixes to make sense or
to identify them with the relevant functional
category. The issue is that a lexicalised
equivalent of the sense expressed by an English
adjective cannot be ignored on the grounds that it
is not an adjective, nor can it be categorized as
an adjective while it is not. It remains a
challenge, specifically in this word category, that
the source and target language differ on
structural level. The next sections explore the
ways in which each of the morphosyntactic
categories can be represented, given their
dynamic structures.

Some English concepts expressed by adjectives
are also expressed by adjectives in Northern
Sotho. The structure of a Northern Sotho
adjective is sketched as follows:

The following example has a class 1 noun as
head:
Monna [yo motelele]
CL1-man CL1-Dem CL1-Pref-tall
/man that is tall/
‘A tall man’
The head noun is given consideration in
the structure because it influences the
morphological structure of the adjective as a
whole. For example, both parts of the adjectival
agreement (in bold italics) agree with the head
noun and will therefore change every time a
noun from a different class is being modified.
For this reason only the basic adjectival stem is
captured as equivalent of the English adjective.
The following examples illustrate the point
made:

‘A tall man’
Monna [yo mošweu]

example, can be used to qualify nouns from
various classes, as illustrated below:

3.2 Descriptive possessive/genitive
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999427">
The genitive or possessive construction in
general serves two semantic functions. It can be
used for direct possession or ownership, and for
describing the feature or quality of the noun
(Poulos and Louwrens, 1994). It is the latter that
is under discussion here. The descriptive
possessive or genitive construction may serve as
the cognitive-semantic equivalent of the English
adjective. The general genitive/possessive
structure is as follows:
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.9964318">
(Head Genitive
noun)
genitive agreement Noun
subject genitive
agreement a

<figureCaption confidence="0.999995">

<bodyText confidence="0.9845386">
The following example of a possessive
construction has a class 1 noun as head:

/man of strong individual/
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.476267">
‘A strong man’
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999576235294118">
The first issue with the genitive is that the
agreement comprises two components which
behave differently. The subject agreement
component is dependent on the head noun while
genitive a is invariant. Secondly, the complement
is a noun phrase, which is just another noun
without the genitive agreement. To encode it
unambiguously we need to include the invariant
part of the genitive agreement with the
complement, which is the descriptive part
serving as equivalent to the English adjective.
First, the invariant part of the genitive agreement
is applicable to every head noun and, secondly, it
makes the complement noun phrase duly
interpreted as a descriptive. The first part of the
genitive agreement will thus be unreliable as
illustrated below (in italics):

3.3 The relative
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998885">
Traditional Northern Sotho grammars (and those
of other Sotho languages) distinguish between
the verbal and nominal relative (Poulos and
Louwrens, 1994; Ziervogel, Lombard and
Mokgokong, 1969). What is traditionally known
as a nominal relative is called a ‘new attributive
adjective’ by Creissels (2011) based on
differentiation between word level and phrase
level. The reason for this difference or overlap is
that the Northern Sotho relative (both verbal and
nominal) can also be a conceptual-semantic
equivalent of the English adjective.
The verbal relative is further divided into
the direct and indirect forms.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.869402">
Verbal relative
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993586941176471">
A class 5 noun serves as head in the following
examples:
Direct: Lephodisa [le le thuntšhago]
CL5-policeman CL5-Dem CL5-SM shoot-
SUFF-go
/Policeman that shoots/
Indirect: Lephodisa [le ba le thuntšhago]
CL5-policeman CL5-Dem CL1-SM CL5-OC
shoot-SUFF-go
/Policeman that they shoot/
‘Policeman that is being shot’
For illustration we shall use only the direct
relative clause, given that the same principles
apply to the indirect relative. Figure 8 illustrates
the structure of the direct verbal relative in
Northern Sotho, as equivalent of the English
adjective:

agreement depend on the head noun. Northern
Sotho has two variant suffixes for the verbal
relative, namely -go and -ng. The affixes -go
and -ng on the verb stem indicate that its
function is not to be a verb, but to qualify the
noun. Both suffixes are equally recognised in
Northern Sotho. Exclusion of variant parts of the
verbal relative is not problematic because they
are written disjunctively from the stem.
Therefore only the verb stem, with the attached
suffix, is recorded.
The Northern Sotho verbal relative as
equivalent of the English adjective appears in
African WordNet as follows:

morphosyntactic challenges to sort
out along the way
Concepts such as worse (232954-a) and worst
(2309979-a) are not easy to represent without
including that which is ‘worse or worst’, or an
adverb. Selection restrictions also have a bearing
on this point as ‘their meaning is determined ...
by the headnoun that they modify’ (Fellbaum,
1998).
Other strategies used in the language to
extend or refine a qualifying concept include the
diminutive affix and reduplication. For example,
yo motelelenyana/yo moteleletgana (diminutive)
and yo moteleletelele (reduplication), which
normally serve for gradability of various
adjectival concepts as is the case with English
degrees of comparison. While it is generally not
necessary to include degrees of comparison in
the database, some English concepts are
perceived as being at various points on a
continuum, where reduplication and adverbs are
employed to differentiate them from others.
Other challenges attending these forms include
the frequent case that the diminutive involves
phonological processes; whereas in reduplication
there is no limit to the number of times the
adjectival stem can be repeated, and for
reduplication involving monosyllabic stems the
adjectival prefix has to interfere repeatedly, for
example:
Adjectival stem -so (black; dark):
borokgo bjo boso (A pair of black
trousers): borokgo bjo bosobosoboso (for
intensity)

5 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99996162962963">
The lack of one-to-one correspondence between
the adjective in English and in Northern Sotho
results in the English adjective equivalent being
represented by various morphosyntactic
categories in Northern Sotho. Given their
structural differences, these Northern Sotho
equivalents require distinctive consideration in
representing them in a manner that will be
consistent with the language system. The
proposal is that while it is understandable that
only stems be considered, invariant parts that are
separate from the stem but that will help to
disambiguate it be retained (for example, a in the
descriptive possessive construction). The suffix
go or ng of the verbal relative also marks it as
different from the verb. The challenge with the
representation in African WordNet is that while
they are all meaning equivalents of the same
English word category, they straddle a number of
morphosyntactic categories in Northern Sotho,
which nevertheless share a semantic function.
While the nominal relative base is a noun,
it selects nouns from classes 11 and 14 and is
unlikely to be problematic. The enumerative has
been left out of the discussion because their
occurrence is not as wide as that of the categories
discussed.

It is not always possible to use an adjective to convey a concept in Northern Sotho that is expressed by an English adjective. Traditional Northern Sotho grammars identify four morphosyntactic categories (the adjective, descriptive possessive [genitive], relative and enumerative) to perform this semantic function (Ziervogel et al., 1969; Poulos and Louwrens 1994). Moreover, each of these equivalents of the English adjective assumes a di</context>

It can be used for direct possession or ownership, and for describing the feature or quality of the noun (Poulos and Louwrens, 1994). It is the latter that is under discussion here. The descriptive possessive or genitive construction may serve as the cognitive-semantic equivalent of the English adjective. The general genitive/possessive structure is as follows: (Head Genitive noun) genitive agreement Noun subject genitive agreement a Figure 6: The genitive/possessive construction The following example of a possessive construction has a class 1 noun as head: Monna [wa senatla] CL1-man CL1-Dem CL7-strong individual /man of strong individual/ ‘A strong man’ The first issue with the genitive is that the agreement comprises two</context>

What is traditionally known as a nominal relative is called a ‘new attributive adjective’ by Creissels (2011) based on differentiation between word level and phrase level. The reason for this difference or overlap is that the Northern Sotho relative (both verbal and nominal) can also be a conceptual-semantic equivalent of the English adjective. The verbal relative is further divided into the direct and indirect forms. Verbal relative A class 5 noun serves as head in the following examples: Direct: Lephodisa [le le thuntšhago] CL5-policeman CL5-Dem CL5</context>

Some of the stems are unambiguous without affixes and some need affixes to make sense or to identify them with the relevant functional category. The issue is that a lexicalised equivalent of the sense expressed by an English adjective cannot be ignored on the grounds that it is not an adjective, nor can it be categorized as an adjective while it is not. It remains a challenge, specifically in this word category, that the source and</context>

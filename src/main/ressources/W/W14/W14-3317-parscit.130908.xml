This paper describes the statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT) systems devel-
oped at RWTH Aachen University for the
German—*English translation task of the
ACL 2014 Eighth Workshop on Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (WMT 2014).
Both hierarchical and phrase-based SMT
systems are applied employing hierarchi-
cal phrase reordering and word class lan-
guage models. For the phrase-based sys-
tem, we run discriminative phrase training.
In addition, we describe our preprocessing
pipeline for German—*English.

<bodyText confidence="0.999943461538462">
For the WMT 2014 shared translation task1
RWTH utilized state-of-the-art phrase-based and
hierarchical translation systems. First, we describe
our preprocessing pipeline for the language pair
German—*English in Section 2. Furthermore, we
utilize morpho-syntactic analysis to preprocess the
data (Section 2.3). In Section 3, we give a survey
of the employed systems and the basic methods
they implement. More details are given about the
discriminative phrase training (Section 3.4) and
the hierarchical reordering model for hierarchical
machine translation (Section 3.5). Experimental
results are discussed in Section 4.

were categorized. In 2013 they were just handled
as normal words which leads to a higher number of
out-of-vocabulary words. For German—*English,
in most cases for numbers like ’3,000’ or ’2.34’
the decimal mark ’,’ and the thousands separator
’.’ has to be inverted. As the training data and also
the test sets contain several errors for numbers in
the source as well as in the target part, we put more
effort into producing correct English numbers.

The WMT German—*English corpus contains
some bilingual sentence pairs with non-German
source or/and non-English target sentences. For
this WMT translation task, we filtered all non-
matching language pairs (in terms of source lan-
guage German and target language English) from
our bilingual training set.
First, we filtered languages which contain non-
ascii characters. For example Chinese, Arabic or
Russian can be easily filtered when deleting sen-
tences which contain more than 70 percent non-
ascii words. The first examples of Table 1 was
filtered due to the fact, that the source sentence
contains too many non-ascii characters.
In a second step, we filtered European lan-
guages containing ascii characters. We used the
WMT monolingual corpora in Czech, French,
Spanish, English and German to filter these lan-
guages from our bilingual data. We could both
delete a sentence pair if it contains a wrong source
language or a wrong target language. That is the
reason why we even search for English sentences
in the source part and for German sentences in
the target part. For each language, we built a
word count of all words in the monolingual data
for each language separately. We removed punc-
tuation which are no indicator of a language. In
our experiments, we only considered words with
frequency higher than 20 (e.g. to ignore names).
Given the word frequency, we removed a bilingual

side of our bilingual training data while the OOV
rate kept the same. Our experiments showed, that
the translation quality is the same with or with-
out removing wrong sentences. Nevertheless, we
reduced the training data size and also the vocabu-
lary size without any degradation in terms of trans-
lation quality.

2.3 Morpho-syntactic Analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.9999255">
In order to reduce the source vocabulary size for
the German→English translation further, the Ger-
man text is preprocessed by splitting German com-
pound words with the frequency-based method de-
scribed in (Koehn and Knight, 2003). To reduce
translation complexity, we employ the long-range
part-of-speech based reordering rules proposed by
Popovi´c and Ney (2006).

In this evaluation, we employ phrase-based trans-
lation and hierarchical phrase-based translation.
Both approaches are implemented in Jane (Vilar et
al., 2012; Wuebker et al., 2012), a statistical ma-
chine translation toolkit which has been developed
at RWTH Aachen University and is freely avail-
able for non-commercial use.2 In the newest inter-
nal version, we use the KenLM Language Model
Interface provided by (Heafield, 2011) for both de-
coders.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897857142857">
In the phrase-based decoder (source cardinality
synchronous search, SCSS, Wuebker et al. (2012)),
we use the standard set of models with phrase
translation probabilities and lexical smoothing in
both directions, word and phrase penalty, distance-
based distortion model, an n-gram target language
model and three binary count features. Additional
models used in this evaluation are the hierarchical
reordering model (HRM) (Galley and Manning,
2008) and a word class language model (wcLM)
(Wuebker et al., 2013). The parameter weights
are optimized with minimum error rate training
(MERT) (Och, 2003). The optimization criterion
is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99998">
3.2 Hierarchical Phrase-based System
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857055555555">
In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang,
2007), a weighted synchronous context-free gram-
mar is induced from parallel text. In addition to
contiguous lexical phrases, hierarchical phrases
with up to two gaps are extracted. The search is
carried out with a parsing-based procedure. The
standard models integrated into our Jane hierar-
chical systems (Vilar et al., 2010; Huck et al.,
2012) are: Phrase translation probabilities and lex-
ical smoothing probabilities in both translation di-
rections, word and phrase penalty, binary features
marking hierarchical phrases, glue rule, and rules
with non-terminals at the boundaries, three binary
count features, and an n-gram language model.
We utilize the cube pruning algorithm for decod-
ing (Huck et al., 2013a) and optimize the model
weights with MERT. The optimization criterion is
BLEU.

3.4 Discriminative Phrase Training
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999075">
In our baseline translation systems the phrase ta-
bles are created by a heuristic extraction from
word alignments and the probabilities are esti-
mated as relative frequencies, which is still the
state-of-the-art for many standard SMT systems.
Here, we applied a more sophisticated discrimi-
native phrase training method for the WMT 2014
German→English task. Similar to (He and Deng,
2012), a gradient-based method is used to opti-
mize a maximum expected BLEU objective, for
which we define BLEU on the sentence level with
smoothed 3-gram and 4-gram precisions. To that
end, the training data is decoded to generate 100-
best lists. We apply a leave-one-out heuristic
(Wuebker et al., 2010) to make better use of the
training data. Using these n-best lists, we itera-
tively perform updates on the phrasal translation
scores of the phrase table. After each iteration,
we run MERT, evaluate on the development set
and select the best performing iteration. In this
work, we perform two rounds of discriminative
training on two separate data sets. In the first
round, training is performed on the concatenation
of newstest2008 through newstest2010 and an au-
tomatic selection from the News-commentary, Eu-
roparl and Common Crawl corpora. The selec-
tion is based on cross-entropy difference of lan-
guage models and IBM-1 models as described by
Mansour et al. (2011) and contains 258K sentence
pairs. The training took 4.5 hours for 30 iterations.
On top of the final phrase-based systems, a second
round of discriminative training is run on the full
news-commentary corpus concatenated with new-
stest2008 through newstest2010.

3.5 A Phrase Orientation Model for
Hierarchical Machine Translation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999926142857143">
In Huck et al. (2013b) a lexicalized reorder-
ing model for hierarchical phrase-based machine
translation was introduced. The model scores
monotone, swap, and discontinuous phrase ori-
entations in the manner of the one presented by
(Tillmann, 2004). Since improvements were re-
ported on a Chinese→English translation task, we
investigate the impact of this model on a European
language pair. As in German the word order is
more flexible compared with the target language
English, we expect that an additional reordering
model could improve the translation quality. In
our experiments we use the same settings which
worked best in (Huck et al., 2013b).

4.1 Experimental Results
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985333333333">
The results of the phrase-based system (SCSS)
as well as the hierarchical phrase-based system
(HPBT) are summarized in Table 3.
The phrase-based baseline system, which in-
cludes the hierarchical reordering model by (Gal-
ley and Manning, 2008) and is tuned on new-
stest2012, reaches a performance of 25.9% BLEU
on newstest2013. Adding the word class language
model improves performance by 0.4% BLEU ab-
solute and the first round of discriminative phrase
training by 0.5% BLEU absolute. Next, we
switched to tuning on a concatenation of new-
stest2011 and newstest2012, which we expect to
be more reliable with respect to unseen data. Al-
though the BLEU score does not improve and TER
goes up slightly, we kept this tuning set in the sub-
sequent setups, as it yielded longer translations,
which in our experience will usually be preferred
by human evaluators. Switching from the inter-
polated language model to the unpruned language
model trained with KenLM on the full concate-
nated monolingual training data in a single pass
gained us another 0.3% BLEU. For the final sys-
tem, we ran a second round of discriminative train-
ing on different training data (cf. Section 3.4),
which increased performance by 0.1% BLEU to
the final score 27.2.
For the phrase-based system, we also exper-
imented with weighted phrase extraction (Man-
sour and Ney, 2012), but did not observe improve-
ments.
The hierarchical phrase-based baseline without
any additional model is on the same level as the
phrase-based system including the word class lan-
guage model, hierarchical reordering model and
discriminative phrase training in terms of BLEU.
However, extending the system with a word class
language model or the additional reordering mod-
els does not seem to help. Even the combination
of both models does not improve the translation
quality. Note, that the hierarchical system was
tuned on the concatenation newstest2011 and new-
stest2012. The final system employs both word
class language model and hierarchical reordering
model.
Both phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-
based final systems are used in the EU-Bridge sys-
tem combination (Freitag et al., 2014).

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999893071428571">
For the participation in the WMT 2014 shared
translation task, RWTH experimented with both
phrase-based and hierarchical translation systems.
For both approaches, we applied a hierarchical
phrase reordering model and a word class lan-
guage model. For the phrase-based system we em-
ployed discriminative phrase training. Addition-
ally, improvements of our preprocessing pipeline
compared to our WMT 2013 setup were described.
New introduced categories lead to a lower amount
of out-of-vocabulary words. Filtering the corpus
for wrong languages gives us lower vocabulary
sizes for source and target without loosing any per-
formance.

However, extending the system with a word class language model or the additional reordering models does not seem to help. Even the combination of both models does not improve the translation quality. Note, that the hierarchical system was tuned on the concatenation newstest2011 and newstest2012. The final system employs both word class language model and hierarchical reordering model. Both phrase-based and hierarchical phrasebased final systems are used in the EU-Bridge system combination (Freitag et al., 2014). 5 Conclusion For the participation in the WMT 2014 shared translation task, RWTH experimented with both phrase-based and hierarchical translation systems. For both approaches, we applied a hierarchical phrase reordering model and a word class language model. For the phrase-based system we employed discriminative phrase training. Additionally, improvements of our preprocessing pipeline compared to our WMT 2013 setup were described. New introduced categories lead to a lower amount of out-of-vocabulary words. Filtering the corpus for wrong languages gives us lower vocabulary sizes for source an</context>

The phrase-based baseline system, which includes the hierarchical reordering model by (Galley and Manning, 2008) and is tuned on newstest2012, reaches a performance of 25.9% BLEU on newstest2013. Adding the word class language model improves performance by 0.4% BLEU absolute and the first round of discriminative phrase training by 0.5% BLEU absolute. Next, we switched to tuning on a concatenation of newstest2011 and newstest2012, which we expect to be more reliable with respect to unseen data. Although the BLEU score does not improve and TER goes up slightly, we kept this tuning set in the subsequent setups, as it yielded longer translations, which in our experience will usually be preferred by human ev</context>

Here, we applied a more sophisticated discriminative phrase training method for the WMT 2014 German→English task. Similar to (He and Deng, 2012), a gradient-based method is used to optimize a maximum expected BLEU objective, for which we define BLEU on the sentence level with smoothed 3-gram and 4-gram precisions. To that end, the training data is decoded to generate 100- best lists. We apply a leave-one-out heuristic (Wuebker et al., 2010) to make better use of the training data. Using these n-best lists, we iteratively perform updates on the phrasal translation scores of the phrase table. After each iteration, we run MERT, evaluate on the development set and select the best performing iteration. In this work, we perform two rounds o</context>

Our experiments showed, that the translation quality is the same with or without removing wrong sentences. Nevertheless, we reduced the training data size and also the vocabulary size without any degradation in terms of translation quality. 2.3 Morpho-syntactic Analysis In order to reduce the source vocabulary size for the German→English translation further, the German text is preprocessed by splitting German compound words with the frequency-based method described in (Koehn and Knight, 2003). To reduce translation complexity, we employ the long-range part-of-speech based reordering rules proposed by Popovi´c and Ney (2006). 3 Translation Systems In this evaluation, we employ phrase-based translation and hierarchical phrase-based translation. Both approaches are implemented in Jane (Vilar et al., 2012; Wuebker et al., 2012), a statistical machine translation toolkit which has been developed at RWTH Aachen University and is freely available for non-commercial use.2 In the newest internal version, we use the KenLM Language Model Interface provided by (Heafield, 2011) for both decode</context>

Switching from the interpolated language model to the unpruned language model trained with KenLM on the full concatenated monolingual training data in a single pass gained us another 0.3% BLEU. For the final system, we ran a second round of discriminative training on different training data (cf. Section 3.4), which increased performance by 0.1% BLEU to the final score 27.2. For the phrase-based system, we also experimented with weighted phrase extraction (Mansour and Ney, 2012), but did not observe improvements. The hierarchical phrase-based baseline without any additional model is on the same level as the phrase-based system including the word class language model, hierarchical reordering model and discriminative phrase training in terms of BLEU. However, extending the system with a word class language model or the additional reordering models does not seem to help. Even the combination of both models does not improve the translation quality. Note, that the hierarchical system was tuned on the concatenation newstest2011 and newstest2012. The final system employs bo</context>

After each iteration, we run MERT, evaluate on the development set and select the best performing iteration. In this work, we perform two rounds of discriminative training on two separate data sets. In the first round, training is performed on the concatenation of newstest2008 through newstest2010 and an automatic selection from the News-commentary, Europarl and Common Crawl corpora. The selection is based on cross-entropy difference of language models and IBM-1 models as described by Mansour et al. (2011) and contains 258K sentence pairs. The training took 4.5 hours for 30 iterations. On top of the final phrase-based systems, a second round of discriminative training is run on the full news-commentary corpus concatenated with newstest2008 through newstest2010. 3.5 A Phrase Orientation Model for Hierarchical Machine Translation In Huck et al.

To that end, the training data is decoded to generate 100- best lists. We apply a leave-one-out heuristic (Wuebker et al., 2010) to make better use of the training data. Using these n-best lists, we iteratively perform updates on the phrasal translation scores of the phrase table. After each iteration, we run MERT, evaluate on the development set and select the best performing iteration. In this work, we perform two rounds of discriminative training on two separate data sets. In the first round, training is performed on the concatenation of newstest2008 through newstest2010 and an automatic selection from the News-commentary, Europarl and Common Crawl corpora. The selection is based on cross-entropy difference of langu</context>

To reduce translation complexity, we employ the long-range part-of-speech based reordering rules proposed by Popovi´c and Ney (2006). 3 Translation Systems In this evaluation, we employ phrase-based translation and hierarchical phrase-based translation. Both approaches are implemented in Jane (Vilar et al., 2012; Wuebker et al., 2012), a statistical machine translation toolkit which has been developed at RWTH Aachen University and is freely available for non-commercial use.2 In the newest internal version, we use the KenLM Language Model Interface provided by (Heafield, 2011) for both decoders. 2http://www.hltpr.rwth-aachen.de/jane/ 3.1 Phrase-based System In the phrase-based decoder (source cardinality synchronous search, SCSS, Wuebker et al.

(2012)), we use the standard set of models with phrase translation probabilities and lexical smoothing in both directions, word and phrase penalty, distancebased distortion model, an n-gram target language model and three binary count features. Additional models used in this evaluation are the hierarchical reordering model (HRM) (Galley and Manning, 2008) and a word class language model (wcLM) (Wuebker et al., 2013). The parameter weights are optimized with minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003). The optimization criterion is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). 3.2 Hierarchical Phrase-based System In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2007), a weighted synchronous context-free grammar is induced from parallel text. In addition to contiguous lexical phrases, hierarchical phrases with up to two gaps are extracted. The search is carried out with a parsing-based procedure. The standard models integrated into our Jane hierarchical systems (Vilar et al., 2010; Huck et al., 2012) are: Phrase trans</context>

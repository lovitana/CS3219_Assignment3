Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999755375">
Opinion inference arises when opinions
are expressed toward states and events
which positive or negatively affect entities,
i.e., benefactive and malefactive events.
This paper addresses creating a lexicon of
such events, which would be helpful to in-
fer opinions. Verbs may be ambiguous,
in that some meanings may be benefac-
tive and others may be malefactive or nei-
ther. Thus, we use WordNet to create a
sense-level lexicon. We begin with seed
senses culled from FrameNet and expand
the lexicon using WordNet relationships.
The evaluations show that the accuracy of
the approach is well above baseline accu-
racy.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999513225806452">
Opinions are commonly expressed in many kinds
of written and spoken text such as blogs, reviews,
new articles, and conversation. Recently, there
have been a surge in reserach in opinion analy-
sis (sentiment analysis) research (Liu, 2012; Pang
and Lee, 2008).
While most past researches have mainly ad-
dressed explicit opinion expressions, there are a
few researches for implicit opinions expressed via
implicatures. Deng and Wiebe (2014) showed
how sentiments toward one entity may be prop-
agated to other entities via opinion implicature
rules. Consider The bill would curb skyrocketing
health care costs. Note that curb costs is bad for
the object costs since the costs are reduced. We
can reason that the writer is positive toward the
event curb since the event is bad for the object
health care costs which the writer expresses an ex-
plicit negative sentiment (skyrocketing). We can
reason from there that the writer is positive toward
the bill, since it is the agent of the positive event.
These implicature rules involve events that pos-
itively or negatively affect the object. Such events
are called malefactive and benefactive, or, for ease
of writing, goodFor (gf) and badFor (bf) (here-
after gfbf). The list of gfbf events and their polari-
ties (gf or bf) are necessary to develop a fully auto-
matic opinion inference system. On first thought,
one might think that we only need lists of gfbf
words. However, it turns out that gfbf terms may
be ambiguous – a single word may have both gf
and bf meanings.
Thus, in this work, we take a sense-level ap-
proach to acquire gfbf lexicon knowledge, lead-
ing us to employ lexical resources with fine-
grained sense rather than word representations.
For that, we adopt an automatic bootstrapping
method which disambiguates gfbf polarity at the
sense-level utilizing WordNet, a widely-used lex-
ical resource. Starting from the seed set manually
generated from FrameNet, a rich lexicon in which
words are organized by semantic frames, we ex-
plore how gfbf terms are organized in WordNet via
semantic relations and expand the seed set based
on those semantic relations.
The expanded lexicon is evaluated in two ways.
First, the lexicon is evaluated against a corpus that
has been annotated with gfbf information at the
word level. Second, samples from the expanded
lexicon are manually annotated at the sense level,
which gives some idea of the prevalence of gfbf
lexical ambiguity and provides a basis for sense-
level evaluation. Also, we conduct the agreement
study. The results show that the expanded lexi-
con covers more than half of the gfbf instances
in the gfbf corpus, and the system’s accuracy, as
measured against the sense-level gold standard, is
substantially higher than baseline. In addition, in
the agreement study, the annotators achieve good
agreement, providing evidence that the annotation
task is feasible and that the concept of gfbf gives
us a natural coarse-grained grouping of senses.

2 The GFBF Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999929384615385">
A corpus of blogs and editorials about the Afford-
able Care Act, a controversial topic, was manu-
ally annotated with gfbf information by Deng et
al. (2013)1. This corpus provides annotated gfbf
events and the agents and objects of the events. It
consists of 134 blog posts and editorials. Because
the Affordable Health Care Act is a controversial
topic, the data is full of opinions. In this corpus,
1,411 gfbf instances are annotated, each including
a gfbf event, its agent, and its object (615 gf in-
stances and 796 bf instances). 196 different words
appear in gf instances and 286 different words ap-
pear in bf instances; 10 words appear in both.

3 Sense-Level GFBF Ambiguity
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9891024">
A word may have one or more meanings. For
that, we use WordNet2, which is a large lexical
database of English (Miller et al., 1990). In Word-
Net, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are or-
ganized by semantic relations between meanings
(senses). We assume that a sense is exactly one
of gf, bf, or neither. Since words often have more
than one sense, the polarity of a word may or may
not be consistent, as the following WordNet exam-
ples show.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.996683466666667">
• A word with only gf senses: encourage
S1: (v) promote, advance, boost, further, en-
courage (contribute to the progress or growth
of)
S2: (v) encourage (inspire with confidence;
give hope or courage to)
S3: (v) encourage (spur on)
• A word with only bf senses: assault
S1: (v) assail, assault, set on, attack (attack
someone physically or emotionally)
S2: (v) rape, ravish, violate, assault, dis-
honor, dishonour, outrage (force (someone)
to have sex against their will)
S3: (v) attack, round, assail, lash out, snipe,
assault (attack in speech or writing)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994433833333333">
All senses of encourage are good for the object,
and all senses of assault are bad for the object.
The polarity is always same regardless of sense.
In such cases, for our purposes, which particular
sense is being used does not need to be determined
because any instance of the word will be good for

(bad for); that is, word-level approaches can work
well. However, word-level approaches are not ap-
plicable for all the words. Consider the following:
• A word with gf and neutral senses: inspire
S3: (v) prompt, inspire, instigate (serve as the
inciting cause of)
S4: (v) cheer, root on, inspire, urge, barrack,
urge on, exhort, pep up (spur on or encourage
especially by cheers and shouts)
S6: (v) inhale, inspire, breathe in (draw in
(air))
• A word with bf and neutral senses: neutral-
ize
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.989070375">
S2: (v) neutralize, neutralise, nullify, negate
(make ineffective by counterbalancing the ef-
fect of)
S6: (v) neutralize, neutralise (make chemi-
cally neutral)
The words inspire and neutralize both have 6
senses (we list a subset due to space limitations).
For inspire, while S3 and S4 are good for the ob-
ject, S6 doesn’t have any polarity, i.e., it is a neu-
tral (we don’t think of inhaling air as good for the
air). Also, while S2 of neutralize is bad for the
object, S6 is neutral (neutralizing a solution just
changes its pH). Thus, if word-level approaches
are applied using these words, some neutral in-
stances may be incorrectly classified as gf or bf
events.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997503666666667">
• A word with gf and bf senses: fight
S2: (v) fight, oppose, fight back, fight down,
defend (fight against or resist strongly)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998524125">
S4: (v) crusade, fight, press, campaign, push,
agitate (exert oneself continuously, vigor-
ously, or obtrusively to gain an end or engage
in a crusade for a certain cause or person; be
an advocate for)
As mentioned in Section 2, 10 words are ap-
peared in both gf and bf instances. Since only
words and not senses are annotated in the corpus,
such conflicts arise. These 10 words account for
9.07% (128 instances) of all annotated instances.
One example is fight. In the corpus instance fight
for a piece of legislation, fight is good for the ob-
ject, a piece of legislation. This is S4. However,
in the corpus instance we need to fight this repeal,
the meaning of fight here is S2, so fight is bad for
the object, this repeal.

of word-level promise to have higher precision.

<bodyText confidence="0.9998975">
In this section, we develop a sense-level gfbf lex-
icon by exploiting WordNet. The method boot-
straps from a seed lexicon and iteratively follows
WordNet relations. We consider only verbs.

4.1 Seed Lexicon
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999980307692308">
To preserve the corpus for evaluation, we created
a seed set that is independent from the corpus. An
annotator who didn’t have access to the corpus
manually selected gfbf words from FrameNet3 in
the light of semantic frames. The annotator found
592 gf words and 523 bf words. Decomposing
each word into its senses in WordNet, there are
1,525 gf senses and 1,154 bf senses. 83 words ex-
tracted from FrameNet overlap with gfbf instances
in the corpus. For independence, those words were
discarded. Among the senses of the remaining
words, we randomly choose 200 gf senses and 200
bf senses.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.982976">
4.2 Expansion Method
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992841217391304">
In WordNet, verb senses are arranged into hier-
archies, that is, verb senses towards the bottom
of the trees express increasingly specific manners.
Thus, we can follow hypernym relations to more
general senses and troponym relations to more spe-
cific verb senses. Since the troponym relation
refers to a specific elaboration of a verb sense, we
hypothesized that troponyms of a synset tends to
have its same polarity (i.e., gf or bf). We only con-
sider the direct troponyms in a single iteration. Al-
though the hypernym is a more general term, we
hypothesized that direct hypernyms tend to have
the the same or neutral polarity, but not the oppo-
site polarity. Also, the verb groups are promising;
even though the coverage is incomplete, we expect
the verb groups to be the most helpful.
WordNet Similarity4, is a facility that provides a
variety of semantic similarity and relatedness mea-
sures based on information found in the Word-
Net lexical database. We choose Jiang&amp;Conrath
(1997) (jcn) method which has been found to be
effective for such tasks by NLP researchers. When
two concetps aren’t related at all, it returns 0. The

more they are related, the higher the value is re-
tuned. We regarded words with similarity values
greater than 1.0 to be similar words.
Beginning with its seed set, each lexicon (gf and
bf) is expanded iteratively. On each iteration, for
each sense in the current lexicon, all of its direct
troponyms, direct hypernyms, and members of the
same verb group are extracted and added to the
lexicon for the next iteration. Similarity, for each
sense, all words with above-threshold jcn values
are added. For new senses that are extracted for
both the gf and bf lexicons, we ignore such senses,
since there is conflicting evidence (recall that we
assume a sense has only one polarity, even if a
word may have senses of different polarities).

4.3 Corpus Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999653176470588">
In this section, we use the gfbf annotations in the
corpus as a gold standard. The annotations in the
corpus are at the word level. To use the annota-
tions as a sense-level gold standard, all the senses
of a word marked gf (bf) in the corpus are con-
sidered to be gf (bf). While this is not ideal, this
allows us to evaluate the lexicon against the only
corpus evidence available.
The 196 words that appear in gf instances in
the corpus have a total of 897 senses, and the 286
words that appear in bf instances have a total of
1,154 senses. Among them, 125 senses are con-
flicted: a sense of a word marked gf in the corpus
could be a member of the same synset as a sense
of a word marked bf in the corpus. For a more reli-
able gold-standard set, we ignored these conflicted
senses. Thus, the gold-standard set contains 772 gf
senses and 1,029 bf senses.
Table 1 shows the results after five iterations of
lexicon expansion. In total, the gf lexicon contains
4,157 senses and the bf lexicon contains 5,071
senses. The top half gives the results for the gf
lexicon and the bottom half gives the results for
the bf lexicon. In the table, gfOverlap means the
overlap between the senses in the lexicon in that
row and the gold-standard gf set, while bfOverlap
is the overlap between the senses in the lexicon in
that row and the gold-standard bf set. That is, of
the 772 senses in the gf gold standard, 449 (58%)
are in the gf expanded lexicon while 105 (14%)
are in the bf expanded lexicon.
Accuracy (Acc) for gf is calculated as #gfOver-
lap / (#gfOverlap + #bfOverlap) and bf is calcu-
lated as #bfOverlap / (#gfOverlap + #bfOverlap).

Overall, accuracy is higher for the bf than the
gf lexicon. The results in the table are broken
down by semantic relation. Note that the individ-
ual counts do not sum to the totals because senses
of different words may actually be the same sense
in WordNet. The results for the bf lexicon are con-
sistently high over all semantic relations. The re-
sults for the gf lexicon are more mixed, but all re-
lations are valuable.
The WordNet Similarity is advantageous be-
cause it detects similar senses automatically, so
may provide coverage beyond the semantic rela-
tions coded in WordNet.
Overall, the verb group is the most informative
relation, as we suspected.
Although the gf-lexicon accuracy for the tro-
ponym relation is not high, it has the advantage
is that it yields the most number of senses. Its
lower accuracy doesn’t support our original hy-
pothesis. We first thought that verbs lower down in
the hierarchy would tend to have the same polar-
ity since they express specific manners character-
izing an event. However, this hypothesis is wrong.
Even though most troponyms have the same polar-
ity, there are many exceptions. For example, pro-
tect#v#1, which means the first sense of the verb
protect, has 18 direct troponyms such as cover
for#v#1, overprotect#v#2, and so on. protect#v#1
is a gf event because the meaning is “shielding
from danger” and most troponyms are also gf
events. However, overprotect#v#2, which is one
of troponyms of protect#v#1, is a bf event.
For the hypernym relation, the number of de-
tected senses is not large because many were al-
ready detected in previous iterations (in general,
there are fewer nodes on each level as hypernym
links are traversed).

4.4 Sense Annotation Evaluation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999877">
For a more direct evaluation, two annotators, who
are co-authors, independently annotated a sample
of senses. We randomly selected 60 words among
the following classes: 10 pure gf words (i.e., all
senses of the words are classified by the expan-
sion method, and all senses are put into the gf lex-
icon), 10 pure bf words, 20 mixed words (i.e., all
senses of the words are classified by the expan-
sion method, and some senses are put into the gf
lexicon while others are put into the bf lexicon),
and 20 incomplete words (i.e., some senses of the
words are not classified by the expansion method).
The total number of senses is 151; 64 senses
are classified as gf, 56 senses are classified as bf,
and 31 senses are not classified. We included more
mixed than pure words to make the results of the
study more informative. Further, we wanted to in-
cluded non-classified senses as decoys for the an-
notators. The annotators only saw the sense en-
tries from WordNet. They didn’t know whether
the system classified a sense as gf or bf or whether
it didn’t classify it at all.
Table 2 evaluates the lexicons against the man-
ual annotations, and in comparison to the ma-
jority class baseline. The top half of the table
shows results when treating Anno1’s annotations
as the gold standard, and the bottom half shows
the results when treating Anno2’s as the gold stan-
dard. Among 151 senses, Anno1 annotated 56
senses (37%) as gf, 51 senses (34%) as bf, and
44 senses (29%) as neutral. Anno2 annotated 66
senses (44%) as gf, 55 senses (36%) as bf, and
30 (20%) senses as neutral. The incorrect cases
are divided into two sets: incorrect opposite con-
sists of senses that are classified as the opposite
polarity by the expansion method (e.g., the sense
is classified into gf, but annotator annotates it as
bf), and incorrect neutral consists of senses that
the expansion method classifies as gf or bf, but the
annotator marked it as neutral. We report the accu-
racy and the percentage of cases for each incorrect
case. The accuracies substantially improve over
baseline for both annotators and for both classes.
In Table 3, we break down the results into gfbf
classes. The gf accuracy measures the percentage
of correct gf senses out of all senses annotated as
gf according to the annotations (same as bf accu-
racy). As we can see, accuracy is higher for the
bf than the gf. The conclusion is consistent with
what we have discovered in Section 4.3.

<page confidence="0.994751">

<bodyText confidence="0.999590428571429">
By Anno1, 8 words are detected as mixed
words, that is, they contain both gf and bf senses.
By Anno2, 9 words are mixed words (this set in-
cludes the 8 mixed words of Anno1). Among
the randomly selected 60 words, the proportion of
mixed words range from 13.3% to 15%, according
to the two annotators. This shows that gfbf lexical
ambiguity does exist.
To measure agreement between the annotators,
we calculate two measures: percent agreement and
κ (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). κ measures the
amount of agreement over what is expected by
chance, so it is a stricter measure. Percent agree-
ment is 0.84 and κ is 0.75.

5 Related Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995015625">
Lexicons are widely used in sentiment analysis
and opinion extraction. There are several previ-
ous works to acquire or expand sentiment lexi-
cons such as (Kim and Hovy, 2004), (Strapparava
and Valitutti, 2004), (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006),
(Gyamfi et al., 2009), (Mohammad and Turney,
2010) and (Peng and Park, 2011). Such senti-
ment lexicons are helpful for detecting explicitly
stated opinions, but are not sufficient for recog-
nizing implicit opinions. Inferred opinions often
have opposite polarities from the explicit senti-
ment expressions in the sentence; explicit senti-
ments must be combined with benefactive, male-
factive state and event information to detect im-
plicit sentiments. There are few previous works
closest to ours. (Feng et al., 2011) build con-
notation lexicons that list words with connotative
polarity and connotative predicates. Goyal et al.
(2010) generate a lexicon of patient polarity verbs
that imparts positive or negative states on their pa-
tients. Riloff et al. (2013) learn a lexicon of nega-
tive situation phrases from a corpus of tweets with
hashtag “sarcasm”.
Our work is complementary to theirs in that
their acquisition methods are corpus-based, while
we acquire knowledge from lexical resources.
Further, all of their lexicons are word level while
ours are sense level. Finally, the types of entries
among the lexicons are related but not the same.
Ours are specifically designed to support the au-
tomatic recognition of implicit sentiments in text
that are expressed via implicature.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987425">
In this paper, we developed a sense-level gfbf
lexicon which was seeded by entries culled from
FrameNet and then expanded by exploiting se-
mantic relations in WordNet. Our evaluations
show that such lexical resources are promising for
expanding such sense-level lexicons. Even though
the seed set is completely independent from the
corpus, the expanded lexicon’s coverage of the
corpus is not small. The accuracy of the expanded
lexicon is substantially higher than baseline accu-
racy. Also, the results of the agreement study are
positive, providing evidence that the annotation
task is feasible and that the concept of gfbf gives
us a natural coarse-grained grouping of senses.
However, there is still room for improvement.
We believe that gf/bf judgements of word senses
could be effectively crowd-sourced; (Akkaya et
al., 2010), for example, effectively used Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for similar coarse-
grained judgements. The idea would be to use au-
tomatic expansion methods to create a sense-level
lexicon, and then have AMT workers judge the
entries in which we have least confidence. This
would be much more time- and cost-effective.
The seed sets we used are small - only 400 total
senses. We believe it will be worth the effort to
create larger seed sets, with the hope to mine many
additional gfbf senses from WordNet.
To exploit the lexicon to recognize sentiments in
a corpus, the word-sense ambiguity we discovered
needs to be addressed. There is evidence that the
performance of word-sense disambiguation sys-
tems using a similar coarse-grained sense inven-
tory is much better than when the full sense inven-
tory is used (Akkaya et al., 2009; Akkaya et al.,
2011). That, coupled with the fact that our study
suggests that many words are unambiguous with
respect to the gfbf distinction, makes us hopeful
that gfbf information may be practically exploited
to improve sentiment analysis in the future.

<abstract confidence="0.982647882352941">Opinion inference arises when opinions are expressed toward states and events which positive or negatively affect entities, i.e., benefactive and malefactive events. This paper addresses creating a lexicon of such events, which would be helpful to infer opinions. Verbs may be ambiguous, in that some meanings may be benefactive and others may be malefactive or neither. Thus, we use WordNet to create a sense-level lexicon. We begin with seed senses culled from FrameNet and expand the lexicon using WordNet relationships. The evaluations show that the accuracy of the approach is well above baseline accuracy.</abstract>

Even though the seed set is completely independent from the corpus, the expanded lexicon’s coverage of the corpus is not small. The accuracy of the expanded lexicon is substantially higher than baseline accuracy. Also, the results of the agreement study are positive, providing evidence that the annotation task is feasible and that the concept of gfbf gives us a natural coarse-grained grouping of senses. However, there is still room for improvement. We believe that gf/bf judgements of word senses could be effectively crowd-sourced; (Akkaya et al., 2010), for example, effectively used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for similar coarsegrained judgements. The idea would be to use automatic expansion methods to create a sense-level lexicon, and then have AMT workers judge the entries in which we have least confidence. This would be much more time- and cost-effective. The seed sets we used are small - only 400 total senses. We believe it will be worth the effort to create larger seed sets, with the hope to mine many additional gfbf senses from WordNet. To exploit the lexicon to recognize sentiments in a corpus, the word-sense ambiguity we discovered</context>

The conclusion is consistent with what we have discovered in Section 4.3. 110 By Anno1, 8 words are detected as mixed words, that is, they contain both gf and bf senses. By Anno2, 9 words are mixed words (this set includes the 8 mixed words of Anno1). Among the randomly selected 60 words, the proportion of mixed words range from 13.3% to 15%, according to the two annotators. This shows that gfbf lexical ambiguity does exist. To measure agreement between the annotators, we calculate two measures: percent agreement and κ (Artstein and Poesio, 2008). κ measures the amount of agreement over what is expected by chance, so it is a stricter measure.

Note that curb costs is bad for the object costs since the costs are reduced. We can reason that the writer is positive toward the event curb since the event is bad for the object health care costs which the writer expresses an explicit negative sentiment (skyrocketing).

Since words often have more than one sense, the polarity of a word may or may not be consistent, as the following WordNet examples show. • A word with only gf senses: encourage S1: (v) promote, advance, boost, further, encourage (contribute to the progress or growth of) S2: (v) encourage (inspire with confidence; give hope or courage to) S3: (v) encourage (spur on) • A word with only bf senses: assault S1: (v) assail, as</context>

Thus, we use WordNet to create a sense-level lexicon. We begin with seed senses culled from FrameNet and expand the lexicon using WordNet relationships. The evaluations show that the accuracy of the approach is well above baseline accuracy. 1 Introduction Opinions are commonly expressed in many kinds of written and spoken text such as blogs, reviews, new articles, and conversation. Recently, there have been a surge in reserach in opinion analysis (sentiment analysis) research (Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008). While most past researches have mainly addressed explicit opinion expressions, there are a few researches for implicit opinions expressed via implicatures. Deng and Wiebe (2014) showed how sentiments toward one entity may be propagated to other entities via opinion implicature rules. Consider The bill would curb skyrocketing health care costs. Note that curb costs is bad for the object costs since the costs are reduced. We can reason that the writer is positive toward the event curb since the event is bad for the object health care costs which the writer expresses an explicit negative sentim</context>

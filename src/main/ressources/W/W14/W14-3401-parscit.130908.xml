Abstract
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999817973684211">
Zoonotic viruses, viruses that are trans-
mittable between animals and humans,
represent emerging or re-emerging patho-
gens that pose significant public health
threats throughout the world. It is there-
fore crucial to advance current surveil-
lance mechanisms for these viruses
through outlets such as phylogeography.
Phylogeographic techniques may be ap-
plied to trace the origins and geographical
distribution of these viruses using se-
quence and location data, which are often
obtained from publicly available data-
bases such as GenBank. Despite the abun-
dance of zoonotic viral sequence data in
GenBank records, phylogeographic anal-
ysis of these viruses is greatly limited by
the lack of adequate geographic metadata.
Although more detailed information may
often be found in the related articles refer-
enced in these records, manual extraction
of this information presents a severe bot-
tleneck. In this work, we propose an auto-
mated system for extracting this infor-
mation using Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP) methods. In order to vali-
date the need for such a system, we first
determine the percentage of GenBank rec-
ords with “insufficient” geographic
metadata for seven well-studied zoonotic
viruses. We then evaluate four different
named entity recognition (NER) systems
which may help in the automatic extrac-
tion of information from related articles
that can be used to improve the GenBank
geographic metadata. This includes a
novel dictionary-based location tagging
system that we introduce in this paper.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999651230769231">
Zoonotic viruses, viruses that are transmittable
between animals and humans, have become in-
creasingly prevalent in the last century leading to
the rise and re-emergence of a variety of diseases
(Krauss, 2003). In order to enhance currently
available surveillance systems for these viruses, a
better understanding of their origins and transmis-
sion patterns is required. This need has led to a
greater amount of research in the field of phylo-
geography, the study of geographical lineages of
species (Avise, 2000). Population health agencies
frequently apply phylogeographic techniques to
trace the evolutionary changes within viral line-
ages that affect their diffusion and transmission
among animal and human hosts (Ciccozzi et al.,
2013; Gray and Salemi, 2012; Weidmann et al.,
2013). Prediction of virus migration routes en-
hances the chances of isolating the viral strain for
vaccine production. In addition, if the source of
the strain is identified, intervention methods may
be applied to block the virus at the source and
limit outbreaks in other areas.
Phylogeographic analysis depends on the utili-
zation of both the sequence data and the location
of collection of specific viral sequences. Re-
searchers often use publicly available databases
such as GenBank for retrieving this information.
For instance, Wallace and Fitch (2008) used data
from GenBank records to study the migration of
the H5N1 virus in various animal hosts over Eu-
rope, Asia and Africa, and were able to identify
the Guangdong province in China as the source of
the outbreak. However, the extent of phylogeo-
graphic modeling is highly dependent on the spec-
ificity of available geospatial information and the
lack of geographic data more specific than the
state or province level may limit phylogeographic
analysis and distort results. In the previous exam-
ple, Wallace and Fitch (2008) had to use town-
level information to identify the source of the
H5N1 outbreak; without specific location data,
they would not have been able to identify the
Guangdong province as the source. Unfortu-
nately, while there is an abundance of sequence
data in GenBank records, many of them lack suf-
ficient geographic metadata that would enable
specific identification of the isolate’s location of
collection. A prior study conducted by Scotch et
al. (2011) showed that the geographic information
of 80% of the GenBank records associated with
single or double stranded RNA viruses within tet-
rapod hosts is less specific than 1st level adminis-
trative boundaries (ADM1) such as state or prov-
ince.
Though many of the records lack specific geo-
graphic metadata, more detailed information is of-
ten available within the journal articles referenced
in them. However, manual extraction of this infor-
mation is time-consuming and cumbersome and
presents a severe bottleneck on phylogeographic
analysis. In this work, we investigate the potential
of NLP techniques to enhance the geographic data
available for phylogeographic studies of zoonotic
viruses using NER systems. In addition to geo-
graphic metadata and sequence information, Gen-
Bank records also contain several other forms of
metadata such as host, collection date and gene for
each isolate. Journal articles that are referenced in
these records often mention the location of isola-
tion for the viral sample in conjunction with re-
lated metadata (Figure 1 provides an example of
such a case). Therefore, by allowing identification
of location mentions along with mentions of re-
lated GenBank metadata in these articles, we be-
lieve that NER systems may help to accurately
link each GenBank record to its corresponding lo-
cation of isolation and distinguish it from other lo-
cation mentions.
Previously Scotch et al. (2011) evaluated the
performance of BANNER (Leaman and Gonza-
lez, 2008) and the Stanford NER tool (Finkel et
al., 2005) for automated identification of gene and
location mentions respectively, in 10 full-text
PubMed articles, each related to a specific Gen-
Bank record. They were both found to achieve f-
scores of less than 0.45, thereby establishing the
need for NER systems with better performance
and/or a larger test corpus (Scotch et al, 2011). In
this study, we start by evaluating the state of geo-
graphic insufficiency for zoonotic viruses in Gen-
Bank records using a new automated approach.
Next, we further expand upon the work done by
Scotch et al. (2011) by building our own diction-
ary-based location-tagging system and evaluating
its performance on a larger corpus corresponding
to over 8,500 GenBank records for zoonotic vi-
ruses. In addition, we also evaluate the perfor-
mance of three other state-of-the-art NER tools
for tagging gene, date and species mentions in this
corpus. We believe that identification of these en-
tities will be useful for the future development of
a system for extracting the location of collection
of viral isolates from articles related to their re-
spective GenBank records.

The process undertaken to complete this study can
be divided into three distinct stages: selection of
the zoonotic viruses and extraction of relevant
GenBank data related to each virus, computation
of “sufficiency” statistics on the extracted data,
and development/evaluation of NER systems for
tagging location, gene, date and species mentions
in full-text PubMed Central articles. A detailed
description of each phase is given below.

<bodyText confidence="0.969014533333333">
Database Integration: The data extracted from
Genbank was used to compute the percentage of
GenBank records that had insufficient geographic
information for each of the selected viruses. In or-
der to perform this computation, we used data
from the ISO 3166-1 alpha-21 table and the
GeoNames database. The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 is
the International Standard for representing coun-
try names using two-letter codes. The GeoNames2
database contains a variety of geospatial data for
over 10 million locations on earth, including the
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the country of each
location and a feature code that can be used to de-
termine the administrative level of each location.
To allow for efficient querying, we downloaded
the main GeoNames table and the ISO alpha-2
country codes table from their respective websites
and stored them in a local SQL database. Prior to
adding the ISO data to the database, some com-
monly used country names and their correspond-
ing country codes were added to the table since it
only included a single title for each country. For
example, the ISO table included the country name
“United States” but not alternate names such as
“USA”, “United States of America”, or “US”. Us-
ing the created database in conjunction with a par-
ser written in Java, we were able to retrieve most

<bodyText confidence="0.999647545454545">
Sufficiency Criteria: For the purpose of this
project, we considered any geographical bound-
ary more specific than ADM1 to be “sufficient”.
Based on this criterion, a feature code in
GeoNames was categorized as sufficient only if it
was absent from the following list of feature
codes: ADM1, ADM1H, ADMD, ADMDH, PCL,
PCLD, PCLF, PCLH, PCLI and PCLS. Evalua-
tion of the geographical sufficiency of a GenBank
record was dependent upon whether the record in-
cluded a country name. A GenBank record with a
country mention was called sufficient if the geo-
graphic information extracted from that record in-
cluded another place mention whose feature code
fell within the class of sufficient feature codes and
whose ISO country code matched that of the re-
trieved country. For instance, a GenBank record
with the geographic metadata “Orange County,
United States” will be called sufficient since the
place “Orange County” has a sufficient feature
code of “ADM2” and a country code of “US”
which matches the country code of the retrieved
country, “United States”. Place mentions with
matching country codes often had several differ-
ent feature codes in GeoNames. Such places were
only called sufficient if all feature codes corre-
sponding to the given pair of place name and
country code were classified as sufficient. In cases
where the GenBank record had no country men-
tion, the record was called sufficient only if all
matching GeoNames entries for any of the places
mentioned in it had sufficient feature codes. The
sufficiency criteria were designed to ensure that a
geographic location is only called sufficient if its
administrative level was found to be more specific
than ADM1 without any form of ambiguity. Fig-
ure 3 illustrates the pathways of geographical suf-
ficiency for GenBank records in a diagram.
Sufficiency Computation: In order to obtain
the geographic information for each Genbank rec-
ord, we used a Java parser which automatically
extracted data from the “country” field of each
record. Since the “country” field typically con-
tained multiple place mentions divided by a set of
delimiters consisting of comma, colon and hy-
phen, we first split this field using these delimit-
ers. We then checked each string obtained
through this process against the ISO country code
table to determine whether it was a potential coun-
try name for the record’s location. If the query
returned no results, then the locally stored
GeoNames table was searched and for each match
found, the corresponding ISO country code and
feature code were extracted. Figure 4 shows a di-
agram of this process.

<bodyText confidence="0.999989277777778">
In cases where no sufficient location data was
found from the “country” field of a GenBank rec-
ord, the Java parser searched through its “strain”
field. This was done because some viral strains
such as influenza include their location of origin
integrated into their names. For example, the in-
fluenza strain “A/duck/Alberta/35/76” indicates
that the geographic origin of the strain is Alberta.
The different sections of a strain field are sepa-
rated by either forward slash, parenthesis, comma,
colon, hyphen or underscore and so we used a set
of delimiters consisting of these characters to split
this field. Each string thus retrieved was queried
as before on the ISO country code table and the
GeoNames table. GeoNames often returned
matches for strings like ‘raccoons’ and ‘chicken’
which were actually meant to be names of host
species within the “strain” field, and so a list of

some of the most frequently seen host name men-
tions in these records was manually created and
filtered out before querying GeoNames.
Some of the place mentions contained very spe-
cific location information which resulted in
GeoNames not finding a match for them. A list
was created for strings like ‘north’, ‘south-east’,
‘governorate’ etc. which when removed from a
place mention may produce a match. In cases of
potential place mentions which contained any one
of these strings and for which GeoNames returned
no matching result, a second query was performed
after removal of the string.
Evaluation of Sufficiency Computation: We
manually annotated 10% of all influenza records
in GenBank which reference at least one PubMed
Central article as sufficient or insufficient based
on our sufficiency criteria (5731 records). We
then ran our program on these records and com-
pared system results with annotated results.

Creation of Gold Standard Corpus: We created
a gold standard corpus consisting of twenty-seven
manually-annotated full-text PubMed Central ar-
ticles in order to evaluate the performance of NER
systems for tagging location, gene, species and
date mentions in text. The articles corresponded to
over 8,500 GenBank records and were randomly
sampled using the subset of extracted GenBank
records which contained a link to PubMed Central
articles and had insufficient geographic metadata.
Three annotators tagged the following four en-
tities in each article using the freely available an-
notation tool, BRAT (Stenetorp et al., 2012): gene
names, locations, dates and species. Figure 4 pro-
vides an example of the manual annotation in
BRAT. We annotated all mentions of each entity
type, not only those relevant to zoonotic viruses,
in order to evaluate system performance. A total
of over 19,000 entities were annotated within this
corpus. The number of tokens annotated was
about 24,000. A set of annotation guidelines was
created for this process (available upon request).
Before creating the guidelines, each annotator in-
dividually annotated six common articles and
compared and discussed their results to devise a
reasonable set of rules for annotating each entity.
After discussion, the annotators re-annotated the
common articles based on the guidelines and di-
vided the remaining articles amongst themselves.
The inter-annotator agreement was calculated for
each pair of annotators. The annotated corpus will
be made available at diego.asu.edu/downloads.
Development of Automated Location Tag-
ger: We developed a dictionary-based NER sys-
tem using the GeoNames database for automated
identification of location mentions in text. The
dictionary used by this system, which we will
hereby refer to as GeoNamer, was created by re-
trieving distinct place names from the GeoNames
table and filtering out commonly used words from
the retrieved set. Words filtered out include stop
words such as ‘are’ and ‘the’, generic place names
such as ‘cave’ and ‘hill’, numbers like ‘one’ and
‘two’, domain specific words such as ‘biology’
and ‘DNA’, most commonly used surnames like
‘Garcia’, commonly used animal names such as
‘chicken’ and ‘fox’ and other miscellaneous
words such as ‘central’. This was a crucial step
since the GeoNames database contains a wide ar-
ray of commonly used English words which may
cause a large volume of false positives if not re-
moved. The final dictionary consists of 5,396,503
entries. In order to recognize place mentions in a
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.999983428571429">
given set of text files, GeoNamer first builds a Lu-
cene index on the contents of the files. It then con-
structs a phrase query for every entry in the
Geonames dictionary and runs each query on the
Lucene index. The document id, query text, start
offset and end offset for every match found is
written to an output file. We chose this approach
because of its simplicity and efficiency.
Evaluation of NER Systems: Four different
NER systems for identifying species, gene, date
and location mentions in text were evaluated us-
ing the created gold standard. The evaluated sys-
tems include LINNEAUS (Gerner et al., 2010),
BANNER, Stanford SUTime (Chang and Man-
ning, 2012) and GeoNamer. LINNEAUS, BAN-
NER and Stanford SUTime are widely-used,
state-of-the-art open source NER systems for
recognition of species, gene and temporal expres-
sions respectively. GeoNamer is the system we
developed in this work for the purpose of tagging
locations, as described earlier.

Based on our analysis, at least half of the Gen-
Bank records for each of the studied zoonotic vi-
ruses lack sufficient geographic information, and
the proportion of insufficient records can be as
high as 90%. Our automated system for classify-
ing records as insufficient or sufficient was found
to have an accuracy of 72% with 98% of the errors
being a result of insufficient records being called
sufficient. Therefore, our computed estimate of
insufficiency is very likely to be an underestima-
tion of the actual problem. The virus with the
highest level of sufficiency, EEE, had a large
number of records with county level information
in the “country” field. However, the insufficient
records for this virus typically contained no place
mention, not even at the country level. A key rea-
son for our calculated percentage of sufficient
GenBank records being higher for these seven vi-
ruses than what has been previously computed by
Scotch et al. (2011) was the inclusion of the
“strain” field. The “strain” field often contained
specific location information which, when com-
bined with place mentions present within the
“country” field, made the record geographically
sufficient. The virus for which the inclusion of
“strain” field had the greatest impact on boosting
the sufficiency percentage was influenza. Most of
the GenBank records associated with this virus
had structured “strain” fields from which the par-
ser could easily separate place mentions using
GeoNames.
Although the sufficiency classifications pro-
duced by our system were correct most of the
time, there were a few cases where a record got
incorrectly labeled as insufficient even when it
contained detailed geographic information. This
typically happened because GeoNames failed to
return matching results for these places. For in-
stance, the country field “India: Majiara,WB” was
not found to be sufficient even though Majiara is
a city in India because GeoNames has no entry for
it. In some cases the lack of matching result was
due to spelling variations of the place name. For
instance the country field “Indonesia: Yogjakarta”
was called insufficient since “Yogjakarta” is
spelled as “Yogyakarta” in GeoNames. Some-
times the database simply did not contain the ex-
act string present in the GenBank record. For in-
stance, it does not have any entry for the place
“south Kalimantan” but it contains the place name
“kalimantan”. The number of sufficient records
which were called insufficient by our system due
to inexact matching were greatly mitigated by re-
moving strings such as “south” from the place
mention, as described in the “Methods” section.
Most of the NER systems performed signifi-
cantly better with overlap measures than with ex-
act-match measures. This is because our annota-
tion guidelines typically involved tagging the
longest possible match for each entity and the au-
tomated systems frequently missed portions of
each annotation. Stanford SUTime had the best
overlap f-measure of 0.785, closely followed by
LINNEAUS with an overlap f-measure of 0.781.
Although Stanford SUTime was fairly effective at
finding date mentions in text, it tagged all four-
digit-numbers such as “1012” and “2339” as
years, leading to a number of false positives. The
poor recall of LINNEAUS was mostly caused be-
cause the dictionary used by LINNEAUS tagged
only species mentions in text while we tagged ge-
nus and family mentions as well. It also missed a
lot of commonly used animal names such as mon-
key, bat, badger and wolf. GeoNamer was the
third best performer with the highest recall but
second lowest precision. This is because the
GeoNames dictionary contains an extensively
large list of location names, many of which are
commonly used words such as “central”. Even
though we filtered out a vast majority of these
words, it still produced false positives such as
“wizard”. However, its performance was consid-
erably better than that of the Stanford location tag-
ger used by Scotch et al. (2011) which was found
to have a recall, precision and f-score of 0.26, 0.81
and 0.39 respectively. The improved performance
was achieved because of the higher recall of our
system. The GeoNames dictionary provides an
extensive coverage of all location mentions in the
world and the Stanford NER system, which is a
CRF classifier trained on a different dataset, was
not able to recognize many of the place mentions
present in full-text PMC articles related to Gen-
Bank records.
BANNER showed the poorest performance
amongst all the entity taggers evaluated in this pa-
per. In fact, the f-score we achieved for BANNER
in this study was much lower that its past f-score
of 0.42 within the domain of articles related to
GenBank records for viral isolates (Scotch et al.,
2011). As mentioned by Scotch et al. (2011), a
key reason for BANNER’s poor performance in
this domain is the difference between the data set
used to train the BANNER model and the annota-
tion corpus used to test this system. The version
of BANNER used in these two studies was trained
on the training set for the BioCreative 2 Gene

Mention task, which comprised of 15,000 sen-
tences from PubMed abstracts. These abstracts of-
ten contained the full names for gene and protein
mentions while the full-text articles we used
mostly contained the abbreviated forms of gene
names, which BANNER tended to miss. The arti-
cles also contained abbreviated forms of several
entities such as viral strain name (e.g. H1N1) and
species name (e.g. VEEV) which look similar to
abbreviated gene names. Therefore, BANNER of-
ten misclassified these entities as gene mentions.
A possible reason for BANNER having a much
lower performance in this study than in the previ-
ous study conducted by Scotch et al (2011) is the
presence of a large number of tables in the journal
articles we selected. BANNER is a machine learn-
ing system based on conditional random fields
which uses orthographic, morphological and shal-
low syntax features extracted from sentences to
identify gene mentions in text. Such features do
not help greatly for extraction from tables. There-
fore, BANNER was often not able to identify the
gene mentions in the tables present within our cor-
pus, thereby producing false negatives. Moreover,
it tagged several entries within the table as a single
gene name, thereby producing false positives as
well. This reduced both the recall and precision of
BANNER.
Although this study explores the problem of in-
sufficient geographic information in GenBank
more thoroughly than past studies, the number of
papers annotated as the gold standard is still lim-
ited. Thus, the performance of the taggers re-
ported can be construed as a preliminary estimate
at best. The set of taggers and their performance
seem to be adequate for a large-scale application,
with the exception of BANNER. However, we did
not make any changes to the BANNER system
(specifically, re-training) since changes to it are
not possible until sufficient data is annotated for
retraining.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999985108695652">
It can be concluded that the majority of Gen-
Bank records for zoonotic viruses do not contain
sufficient geographic information concerning
their origin. In order to enable phylogeographic
analysis of these viruses and thereby monitor their
spread, it is essential to develop an efficient mech-
anism for extracting this information from pub-
lished articles. Automated NER systems may help
accelerate this process significantly. Our results
indicate that the NER systems LINNEAUS, Stan-
ford SUTime and GeoNamer produce satisfactory
performance in this domain and thus can be used
in the future for linking GenBank records with
their corresponding geographic information.
However, the current version of BANNER is not
well-suited for this task. We will need to train
BANNER specifically for this purpose before in-
corporating it within our system.
We are currently altering the component of our
program which classifies records as sufficient or
insufficient in order to reduce the number of errors
due to insufficient records being called sufficient.
We are also manually looking through GenBank
records for zoonotic viruses with insufficient geo-
graphic metadata and linking them to the location
mentions in related articles which we deem to be
the most likely location of collection for the given
viral isolate. The resulting annotated corpus will
be used to train and evaluate an automated system
for populating GenBank geographic metadata.
We have already covered all GenBank records re-
lated to Encephalitis viruses and close to 10% of
all records related to Influenza which are linked to
PubMed Central articles. The annotation process
has revealed that a large proportion of the infor-
mation allowing linkage of GenBank records to
geographic metadata is often present in tables
within the articles in addition to textual sentences.
Therefore, we have developed a Python parser for
automatically linking GenBank records to loca-
tion mentions using tables from the HTML ver-
sion of the PubMed Central articles. Future work
will include further expansion of this annotation
corpus and the development of an integrated sys-
tem for enhancing GenBank geographic metadata
for phylogeographic analysis of zoonotic viruses.

<abstract confidence="0.999896769230769">Zoonotic viruses, viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans, represent emerging or re-emerging pathogens that pose significant public health threats throughout the world. It is therefore crucial to advance current surveillance mechanisms for these viruses through outlets such as phylogeography. Phylogeographic techniques may be applied to trace the origins and geographical distribution of these viruses using sequence and location data, which are often obtained from publicly available databases such as GenBank. Despite the abundance of zoonotic viral sequence data in GenBank records, phylogeographic analysis of these viruses is greatly limited by the lack of adequate geographic metadata. Although more detailed information may often be found in the related articles referenced in these records, manual extraction of this information presents a severe bottleneck. In this work, we propose an automated system for extracting this information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. In order to validate the need for such a system, we first determine the percentage of GenBank recwith geographic metadata for seven well-studied zoonotic viruses. We then evaluate four different named entity recognition (NER) systems which may help in the automatic extraction of information from related articles that can be used to improve the GenBank geographic metadata. This includes a novel dictionary-based location tagging system that we introduce in this paper.</abstract>

The document id, query text, start offset and end offset for every match found is written to an output file. We chose this approach because of its simplicity and efficiency. Evaluation of NER Systems: Four different NER systems for identifying species, gene, date and location mentions in text were evaluated using the created gold standard. The evaluated systems include LINNEAUS (Gerner et al., 2010), BANNER, Stanford SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) and GeoNamer. LINNEAUS, BANNER and Stanford SUTime are widely-used, state-of-the-art open source NER systems for recognition of species, gene and temporal expressions respectively. GeoNamer is the system we developed in this work for the purpose of tagging locations, as described earlier. 3 Results 3.1 Sufficiency Analysis The system for classifying records as sufficient or insufficient was found to have an accuracy of 72% as compared to manual annotation. 98% of the errors was due to insufficient records being called sufficient.

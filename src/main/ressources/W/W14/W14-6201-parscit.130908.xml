Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999948818181818">
Ontologies have proven to be useful to enhance NLP-based applications such as information ex-
traction. In the biomedical domain rich ontologies are available and used for semantic annotation
of texts. However, most of them have either no or only few non-English concept labels and can-
not be used to annotate non-English texts. Since translations need expert review, a full translation
of large ontologies is often not feasible. For semantic annotation purpose, we propose to use the
corpus to be annotated to identify high occurrence terms and their translations to extend respec-
tive ontology concepts. Using our approach, the translation of a subset of ontology concepts is
sufficient to significantly enhance annotation coverage. For evaluation, we automatically trans-
lated RadLex ontology concepts from English into German. We show that by translating a rather
small set of concepts (in our case 433), which were identified by corpus analysis, we are able to
enhance the amount of annotated words from 27.36 % to 42.65 %.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96439696">
Ontologies offer a powerful way to represent a shared understanding of a conceptualization of a domain
(Gruber, 1993a). They define concepts and relations between them. Further linguistic information, such
as labels, synonyms, abbreviations or definitions, can be attached. This is how ontologies provide a con-
trolled vocabulary for the respective domain. In Information Extraction (IE), the controlled vocabulary
of ontologies is used to recognize ontology concepts in text (also referred to as semantic annotation) and
combine the textual information and the ontological knowledge to allow a deeper understanding of the
text’s semantics.
The problem, however, is that most of the available ontologies are not multilingual, i.e., they have ei-
ther no or only few non-English concept labels. To make ontologies applicable for IE-based applications
dealing with non-English texts, one has to translate at least some of the concept labels. Since high quality
translations need expert review, a full translation of big ontologies is often not feasible. In the biomedical
domain, ontologies have a long tradition and many well designed, large and semantically rich ontologies
exist. At the time of writing, the BioPortal (Noy et al., 2008), an ontology repository for the biomedical
domain, contains 370 ontologies, where 49 have more than 10,000 concepts. Their complete translation
would be very costly.
In many application scenarios, only a subset of ontology concepts is of relevance. This is especially
true for IE: If we consider, e.g., the semantic annotation of medical records in the context of a specific
disease, the translation of a subset of ontology concept labels can be sufficient to increase the number
of ontology concepts found. Thus, the translation of a small set of labels, which is relevant for the
application scenario, is sufficient to increase the ontology’s applicability for IE from non-English texts.
That is why we propose a translation approach that identifies the most relevant concepts for the ap-
plication scenario and adds their translations to the ontology. The application scenario is represented
by the corpus, a ‘large set of domain-specific text’. In the context of IE, the main goal is to achieve a

high annotation coverage, i.e., a high amount of words are semantically annotated with the correlating
ontology concepts. Therefore, we define the terms with high frequency in the corpus as most relevant for
translation, as the translation of high frequency terms increases the annotation coverage significantly. To
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we use the RadLex ontology (Langlotz, 2006) and a corpus
of German radiology reports of lymphoma patients.

Ontology-based IE is a commonly used technique in the biomedical domain. (Meystre et al., 2008) give
a detailed overview of recent research activities. However, most projects focus on English texts. The
ontology translation problem was first described by (Gruber, 1993b) and further formalized by (Espinoza
et al., 2009b). The subproblem we are dealing with is ontology localization, which (Su´arez-figueroa and
G´omez-P´erez, 2008) refers to as ‘the adaptation of an ontology to a particular language and culture’. The
challenges of ontology localization are analyzed in (Espinoza et al., 2009b) and a general methodology
for guiding the localization process is presented. By (Cimiano et al., 2010), ontology localization can
affect two different layers: the lexical layer (labels, definitions and accompanying documentation in
natural language) and the conceptualization itself. Thus, the translation of concept labels we conduct
can be seen as a subtask of ontology localization targeting only the lexical layer. The focus of our
work does not lie in the machine translation task itself but in the intelligent use of existing resources for
multilingual extension of ontologies with the aim to enhance the annotation coverage for a certain corpus.
(Espinoza et al., 2009a) focus on sense disambiguation as major problem in ontology localization, while
we investigate how to increase the efficiency by incorporating a corpus.

3 Overview of the approach
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9955755">
As explained, our main goal is to enhance the annotation coverage of a given non-English corpus by on-
tology translation. Using the corpus to be annotated within the translation process has three advantages:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998716">
• The translation is conducted more efficiently, since we reduce the number of translations that require
a review. This is because only concepts that actually occur in the corpus are proposed as translations.
• The process results in high quality translations, because the corpus can be used to disambiguate the
correct (target) translation candidate for a concept automatically.
• By facilitating a corpus, we make sure that the terms extracted as (target) translation candidates
result in semantic text annotations in the end.

lation to the ontology concept with RID38780. Now, the corpus term can be annotated, which was not
possible before.

quency terms. Using this resource allows us to customize our approach for the required application
scenario. Its content is used to digest the most relevant concepts for translation and determine the
correct translation option. The processing incorporates linguistic and statistical NLP techniques to
extract terms in target language with high frequency from the corpus.
2 Concept Filtering As the list of extracted terms still includes terms without semantic importance,
we introduce this step in order to reduce the list. This includes the removal of terms with certain
technical characters but also those with special linguistic structures, which makes the approach more
efficient.
3 Mapping Corpus Terms to Ontology Concepts Our approach is targeted to translate only existing
ontology concepts. Thus, we need a mechanism to map the terms of the corpus to the ontology
concepts. We do this by employing state-of-the-art dictionary lookups: The English dictionary
equivalences of the German corpus terms are used to find ontology concepts with the same English
labels. Then, the (corpus) term is added as translation to the matching ontology concept as non-
English label. The resulting translated ontology can be used in subsequent NLP-based applications
and is able to serve the need for non-English texts.
In the end, the ontology will be extended with translations. In our case, the RadLex ontology currently
maintains translations as synonyms, but we propose the usage of rdfs:label and language tags as shown
in Figure 3. The introduced steps are described in detail in the following sections.

semantic annotation target, which is annotated with ontology terms. The language-specific translations
used for semantic annotation were found before with the help of the corpus itself. For the study, we use
a corpus of 2,713 radiology reports (from 27 different readers1) of lymphoma patients containing the

<bodyText confidence="0.999738923076923">
This initial analysis includes several steps that enable a statistical analysis of the textual context. Each of
the processing steps is implemented as a single UIMA annotator and integrated into an overall pipeline.
First, semantic information units such as dates and measurements are recognized using regular ex-
pressions. Medical language is rich in abbreviations. Particularly radiologists make use of them, because
they allow an efficient reporting. Therefore, as second step, we build an abbreviation recognition and
extension algorithm on a simple dictionary. The third linguistic task is the determination of the basic
processing units: (1) tokens and (2) sentences. Tokens are split employing the spaces and ‘-’ in the
text, hence no compound splitting is conducted. While token splitting is a rather simple task, sentence
splitting requires disambiguation facilities. Indicators like ‘?’,‘!’,‘;’,‘.’ are used to determine sentence
ends. However, the full stop determines sentence ends only if they are not part of a measurement, date or
abbreviation. As a fourth step, stopwords are removed from the documents to reduce the content to only
relevant tokens. Available language-dependent stopword lists are employed. Finally, each of the tokens
in the text is stemmed with the German version of the Porter stemmer. (Porter, 1997)

4.3 Semantic Annotation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999485">
Since most ontologies are already partially translated, we make use of this fact and semantically annotate
concepts and exclude them in the subsequent filter process (Section 4.6). The annotator implementation
is based on the UIMA ConceptMapper (Tanenblatt et al., 2010). The annotation dictionary is built
from the preferred names and synonyms in the RadLex ontology (as shown in Figure 3). Our concept
mapper combines the stems of the dictionary terminology and the stems of the text tokens and annotates
the matches with the ontology information. If a dictionary term consists of more than one token, an
annotation is created if all of its stems are contained in a single sentence of the corpus. That is also how
single tokens can be assigned more than one annotation.

After the linguistic processing of the preceding steps, the actual term extraction can be performed. In
this initial work, we limit the length of n-grams to three because of performance reasons. Furthermore,
we define that the individual tokens of an n-gram have to co-occur within the same sentence. The output
of this step is a list of terms in target language that are candidates for ontology translation.

The n-grams relevant for translation are determined by their frequency in the corpus. Based on the

(co-)occurrence count of the terms is used for ordering of the terms, whereas the most frequent occurring
term is ranked top.

should be added as translations to the ontology, we remove occurrences of these information units that

2. Concept Mapping The list of English lookup options from the first step is used to find ontology

with RID38780 is assigned the given preferred name “lesion”. If a match is found, the German n-
gram that resulted in the match (“L¨asion”) is regarded as probable translation. In order to increase
the quality of the translation, an expert review is conducted at this time. This is the only manual
step in the whole translation process. After the review, the n-gram is inserted as new RDF triple
for the respective ontology concept. In RadLex translations are currently maintained as synonyms.
However, as this modeling of translations as synonyms does not represent the correct semantics and
misses the important language information, we propose to use rdfs:label for translations added by a
corresponding language tag. Thus, for the example we insert “L¨asion” as additional German label
to the ontology concept (see Figure 3).

6.1 Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999911105263158">
The evaluation of our system is based on the RadLex ontology and a corpus of 2,713 radiology reports of
lymphoma patients. We use the OWL DL version of RadLex3.9.1 from NCBO BioPortal. This version
contains 42,321 concepts, which all have an assigned (English) preferred name and few additionally syn-
onyms. The German translations are represented as synonyms. Most of the German labels were added in
2009, when a first German version was created. Even though the number of concepts is growing signif-
icantly (RadLex3.9 contained 34,899), the number of concepts with non-English labels is not evolving
the same way. Thus, in RadLex3.9.1 less than 25% of the 42,321 concepts have German labels.
Proposed translations for ontology concepts - as output of the described automatic approach - are
evaluated by a clinical expert. We restricted the corpus terms translated to those occurring at least
two times. The whole process results in a list of 742 German labels proposed for ontology extension.
The expert classified these translations as correct or incorrect. In order to assist the expert in better
understanding of the ontology concept to be extended, we provide information on the preferred name,
synonyms as well as preferred names of the next two super classes.
This list of evaluated translations is analyzed in detail using three dimensions: First, we analyze how
the choice of the dictionary influences the translation outcome. Second, we figure out how the term length
and the processing of multi-word terms influences the translation results. Third, the correct translations
are added to an extended RadLex ontology. We compare the annotation results using the initial and
extended RadLex version. We apply accuracy as evaluation measure, which is the proportion of correct
translations in the system-proposed set.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.99993">
6.2 Evaluation of the Translation Services
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999784">
As described in Section 5.1, we use two different dictionaries. As expected, the accuracy of the medical
dictionary is significantly higher than the accuracy of the general dictionary (see Table 1(a)). This is
because in many cases only the domain-specific dictionary contains the correct lookup entry for the
terms. Nevertheless, the general dictionary is necessary, because RadLex contains also general language
terms like ‘increased’ or ‘normal’. Combining the two dictionaries accuracy reaches 75.2%.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999861">
6.3 Evaluation of the N-Gram Length
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999988444444444">
If we take a closer look at n-gram distribution of terms, we see that we translate mainly single words (1-
grams), while 2-grams and 3-grams are translated less often. However, the accuracy of 3-grams reaches
excellent values (see Table 1(b)). Nevertheless, the translation of n-grams is of high importance, as
most of the ontology concepts in the biomedical domain have multiword labels. In particular, labels of
anatomical entities are multiword terms; in RadLex they can grow to 10-grams. Consider for example
‘Organ component of lymphatic tree organ’ or ‘Tendon of second palmar interosseous of left hand’.
Thus, a more sophisticated multiword translation is needed to enhance the number of translations for
n-grams. For us, the improved handling of stopwords is the main focus in future work: While we remove
stopwords in the n-grams, ontology concepts that contain stopwords prevent a match.

6.4 Extension of RadLex and Evaluation of Annotation Coverage
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999990461538462">
From Table 1(a), one can see that we correctly translated 558 RadLex concept labels using both dictio-
naries. After the expert review, we added the (German) terms of these correct matches as labels to 433
distinct RadLex concepts. I.e., some concepts were assigned more than one additional German label.
We refer to the new ontology as the extended RadLex. For the analysis of how the added translations
influence the number of annotations, we conducted two annotation processes. Both the original and the
extended RadLex versions were used to semantically annotate the corpus using the annotator described
in Section 4.3. The measure to indicate the annotation success is annotation coverage, which denotes
the relative amount of tokens for which at least one annotation exists. Table 2 shows that we are able to
enhance the annotation coverage by about 56% by adding only 558 translations. This shows the effec-
tiveness of the approach. A comparison indicator of these numbers deliver English texts: In (Woods and
Eng, 2013) an annotation rate of 62 % was observed for English chest radiography reports. Despite the
restrictiveness of the comparison, we see that an annotation coverage of 42.65 % is high considering that
only about 25 % of the extended RadLex’s concepts have a German label.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.962627">
6.5 Limitations
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999959">
Due to the characteristics of our approach, the outcome of the increased annotation coverage is specific
for the corpus used: Even though the reports come from 27 different readers, the vocabulary of the
evaluated corpus is specific to one disease and thus limited to a certain degree. Because the vocabulary
differentiates in other corpora, the application of the translation added for texts describing other diseases
or reports may not result in increases of the annotation coverage as shown. For other corpora, one has
to run our approach a second time using the new corpus and add further concepts to obtain a similar
annotation coverage. However, we expect the additional effort needed to get smaller over time.

We propose a method to make ontologies usable for multilingual semantic annotation of texts by auto-
matically extending them with translations, without the need to invest much effort in a full translation.
We believe that our approach is able to unlock the high potential of existing ontologies also for low re-

sourced languages. We address the key problem of identifying those concepts that are worth translating
by defining the increase of annotation coverage for a given corpus as the main target. Although it might
seem intuitive to apply an English corpus to identify the most frequent terms and their (source) ontology
concepts to translate, we do not pursue this approach. Especially when dealing with a domain-specific
language, translations are often ambiguous. As the English corpus does not help picking the correct
(target) translation candidate, we decided to start the other way around and facilitate a corpus in target
language. We show the high quality and efficiency of the approach by translating medical terms from
English to German. According to the evaluation results, a better treatment of n-grams shows the biggest
potential for enhancement of the approach. Sophisticated linguistic algorithms for the translation, which
incorporate the ontology context, can increase the matching of the multi-word terms. In future work, we
plan to evaluate our approach using other ontologies from the BioPortal.

<abstract confidence="0.9958275">Ontologies have proven to be useful to enhance NLP-based applications such as information extraction. In the biomedical domain rich ontologies are available and used for semantic annotation of texts. However, most of them have either no or only few non-English concept labels and cannot be used to annotate non-English texts. Since translations need expert review, a full translation of large ontologies is often not feasible. For semantic annotation purpose, we propose to use the corpus to be annotated to identify high occurrence terms and their translations to extend respective ontology concepts. Using our approach, the translation of a subset of ontology concepts is sufficient to significantly enhance annotation coverage. For evaluation, we automatically translated RadLex ontology concepts from English into German. We show that by translating a rather small set of concepts (in our case 433), which were identified by corpus analysis, we are able to enhance the amount of annotated words from 27.36 % to 42.65 %.</abstract>

The problem, however, is that most of the available ontologies are not multilingual, i.e., they have either no or only few non-English concept labels. To make ontologies applicable for IE-based applications dealing with non-English texts, one has to translate at least some of the concept labels. Since high quality translations need expert review, a full translation of big ontologies is often not feasible. In the biomedical domain, ontologies have a long tradition and many well designed, large and semantically rich ontologies exist. At the time of writing, the BioPortal (Noy et al., 2008), an ontology repository for the biomedical domain, contains 370 ontologies, where 49 have more than 10,000 concepts. Their complete translation would be very costly. In many application scenarios, only a subset of ontology concepts is of relevance. This is especially true for IE: If we consider, e.g., the semantic annotation of medical records in the context of a specific disease, the translation of a subset of ontology concept labels can be sufficient to increase the number of ontology concepts found.

The measure to indicate the annotation success is annotation coverage, which denotes the relative amount of tokens for which at least one annotation exists. Table 2 shows that we are able to enhance the annotation coverage by about 56% by adding only 558 translations. This shows the effectiveness of the approach. A comparison indicator of these numbers deliver English texts: In (Woods and Eng, 2013) an annotation rate of 62 % was observed for English chest radiography reports. Despite the restrictiveness of the comparison, we see that an annotation coverage of 42.65 % is high considering that only about 25 % of the extended RadLex’s concepts have a German label. 6.5 Limitations Due to the characteristics of our approach, the outcome of the increased annotation coverage is specific for the corpus used: Even though the reports come from 27 different readers, the vocabulary of the evaluated corpus is specific to one disease and thus limited to a certain degree. Because the vocabulary differ</context>

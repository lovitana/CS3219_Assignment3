<bodyText confidence="0.999979">
We report on an experimental study of the processing of noun-noun compounds by native and
non-native speakers of English, based on Event-Related Potentials recorded during a mask-
primed lexical decision task. Analysis was by generalised linear mixed-effect modelling and
generalised additive mixed modelling. Non-native processing is found to display headedness
effects induced by the mothertongue. The frequency of the constituent nouns and of the in-
tended compounds are also shown to have an effect on processing.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962615384616">
This study examines the processing of noun-noun compounds by native and non-native speakers of
English. Compounds have been extensively studied in the past 40 years from a myriad of viewpoints
(Libben and Jarema, 2006; Lieber and Štekauer, 2009). A key concern has been whether the pro-
cessing of compounds consists in retrieving entities listed in the mind (Butterworth, 1983) or requires
decomposition into constituents listed separately (Semenza et al., 1997; Libben, 1998). Dual-routes
theories contend that the two processes exist side by side (Sandra, 1990). It is now widely accepted
that both constituents are activated during processing, at least in non-lexicalised compounds (Jarema,
2006; Zhang et al., 2012). Noun-noun compounds have also been shown to be processed differently
to non-compounds of similar morphological complexity and length, with compounds yielding longer
reaction times and different electrophysiological correlates (El Yagoubi et al., 2008).
Endocentric compounds contain a head element (dust in (1)) whose lexical category and interpretive
features are inherited by the compound and contribute the core of its meaning (e.g. a kind of dust).
The other element acts as a modifier of that head.

<bodyText confidence="0.999675">
Here we focus on endocentric noun-noun compounds (henceforth NNCs), which have been argued to
embody an underlying structure (Libben, 2006) that is hierarchical, involving the (possibly recursive)
subordination of a modifier to a grammatical head (or a modifier-head compound, as in (2)), with head-
directionality that mirrors that of other noun-complement structures in the same language (Zipser,
2013).

Headedness plays a specific role in the processing of NNCs, as demonstrated by research on Italian
(which crucially features the two word orders in NNCs). Based on a lexical decision task, El Yagoubi
et al. (2008) found priming effects induced by the head, independently of its position in the NNC.
Headedeness effects are not distinguishable from position-in-the-string effects in languages such as
English. For instance, Jarema et al. (1999) observed no difference in the priming of NNCs by the head
or the modifier. Here we take this line of research further, by investigating whether headedness in the
mothertongue affects the processing of transparent, irreversible NNCs in highly advanced second
language learners of English.
Event-related potentials (ERPs) can provide insight into the neural activity associated with the pro-
cessing of compounds. Functional interpretations can be inferred from the temporal and spatial char-
acteristics of electromagnetic activity, and ERP components can sometimes reveal the engagement of
the cognitive processes involved. Our approach is this paper is exploratory (Otten and Rugg, 2005)
and will focus on identifying differences in the amplitude of the EEG signal that can be traced back
to properties of the participants (such as their language background) and properties of the compounds
(such as their frequency of occurrence, and the frequencies of occurrence of their constituents). Infer-
ences based on previously identified ERP components will be drawn in the discussion as appropriate.
Our research questions are: (i) Does non-native processing of NNCs result in different ERP signatures
to native processing? (ii) Is non-native processing of NNCs affected by headedness effects from the
mothertongue?

The participant groups differed in mothertongue: English (control group), Spanish or German (exper-
imental groups). Like English, German features productive compounding, with a head-last structure.
Whereas in Spanish, compounds are essentially head-first, and not productive.

<bodyText confidence="0.999979428571429">
Ten native British English speakers (4 female, mean age 22;11 years; STD 3;3 years), ten native
German learners of English (7 female, mean age 26;5 years; STD 5;7 years) and ten native Spanish
learners of English (3 female, mean age 26;11 years; STD 5;3 years) took part in the study. Partic-
ipants all had initial second-language exposure after 8 years of age, and all scored above 60% on a
cloze test from the Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English. All were right-handed based on the
Briggs and Nebes inventory (Briggs and Nebes, 1975), had no speech or language difficulties and had
normal or corrected-to normal vision.

Experimental stimuli consisted of prime-target pairs, presented in 4 experimental conditions in a 3
(Group) x 2 (Prime Condition) x 2 (Word Order) design. The prime was either the head (e.g. dust in
(3)) or the modifier (e.g. coal in (3)) of the intended compound.
The Word Order factor had 2 levels: licit (modifier - head, as in (3-a)) or reversed (head - modifier,
as in (3-b)). All the NNCs were endocentric and featured a transparent, modification relationship. All

items were tested for irreversibility on an independent group of 30 native speakers. The frequency
of the licit compounds and their constituent nouns was estimated from the post-1990 data in Google
N-grams. To avoid lexicalisation effects, only compounds with very low frequencies were included
(i.e. below 3,300 — mean = 359.5, compared with a mean of 279,300 for the constituent nouns).
There was a total of 480 test items (based on 120 compounds), of which 240 are included in the
present study (as we focus on the Head Prime condition only). The items were pseudo-randomised
into 8 different orders (assigned randomly to participants) and presented in 4 blocks, with a rest in
between.

2.3 Procedure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999782363636364">
Participants were tested individually in a single session lasting approximately 1.5 hours. Stimuli
were presented visually in light grey text on a black background. Each trial began with the visual
presentation of a series of exclamation marks (!!!) for 1000 ms, which was a signal for the participant
to rest their eyes and blink After a delay of 100 ms a fixation point (+) was presented for 250 ms to
signal that the trial was about to begin. After a 100 ms mask (#######), the prime was presented for
100 ms followed by a second mask (for 50 ms) and the target (for 1000 ms). After a delay of 500 ms a
question mark (?) appeared for 2000 ms during which time participants had to make a lexical decision
about the target (as acceptable or not) by pressing (with their right hand) one of two buttons on a
hand-held button box (counterbalanced across participants). Participants were instructed to respond
as accurately as possible; accuracy and reaction times (in ms from the onset of the “?&amp;quot;) were recorded.
After the response (or at the end of 2000 ms if the participant did not respond), there was a delay
of 100 ms before the next trial started. The experimental session was preceded by a practice session
comprising 20 trials, which was repeated until participants could perform the task and procedure with
no errors (usually one or two practice sessions sufficed).
The EEG was recorded (Neuroscan Synamps2) from 60 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded in a cap based
on the extended version of the International 10-20 positioning system (Sharbrough et al., 1991). Ad-
ditional electrodes were placed on the left and right mastoids. Data were recorded using a central
reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz. The ground electrode was positioned between Fz
and Fpz. To capture noise articfacts in the EEG signal due to eye movements, electro-oculograms
(EOGs) were recorded using electrodes positioned at either side of the eyes, and above and below the
left eye. At the beginning of the experiment electrode impedances were below 10 k⌦. The analogue
EEG and EOG recordings were amplified (band pass filter 0.1 to 100Hz), and continuously digitised
(32-bit) at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz. Data were processed offline using Neuroscan Edit 4.3
software (Compumedics Neuroscan) and filtered (0.1-40Hz, 96 dB/Oct, Butterworth zero phase filter).
The effect of eye-blink artifacts was minimised by estimating and correcting their contribution to the
EEG using a regression procedure which involves calculating an average blink from 32 blinks for each
participant, and removing the contribution of the blink from all other channels on a point-by-point ba-
sis. Data were epoched between -100 and 1100 ms relative to the onset of the experimental targets
and baseline-corrected by subtracting the mean amplitude over the pre-stimulus interval. Epochs were
rejected if participants did not make a response within the allocated time (during presentation of the
“?&amp;quot;), or if they made an incorrect response. Subsequently the data was downsampled to 125 Hz. Trial
rejection was not done a priori but based on the residuals of the modelling, resulting in only 0.7% of
discarded data.

The responses on the lexical decision task were analysed with a generalised linear mixed-effect model
with a binomial link function, using the lme4 package, version 1.0-4 (Bates et al., 2013) with the
‘bobyqa’ optimizer. Only those predictors that contributed to the model fit were retained, as shown in
Table 1. The covariate ‘Compound Frequency’ did not reach significance. The model provided a sub-
stantially improved fit compared to the null-hypothesis model with random intercepts for participant

3.2 ERP analysis

<bodyText confidence="0.99996975">
We analysed the electrophysiological response elicited by the presentation of compound words with
the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM, (Wood, 2006; Tremblay and Baayen, 2010; Baayen, to
appear; Baayen et al., in preparation; Kryuchkova et al., 2012)). Generalized additive mixed models
extend the generalized linear mixed model with tools (thin plate regression splines, tensor product
smooths) for modeling non-linear functional relations between one or more predictors and a response
variable. GAMMs, as implemented in the mgcv package 1.7-28, offer three important advantages for
the analysis of EEG data compared to standard linear models and analysis of variance. First, GAMMs
are optimized for dealing with non-linear functional relations between a response (here, the amplitude)

and one or more numerical predictors (resulting in wiggly curves, wiggly surfaces, or, in the case of
more than two predictors, wiggly hypersurfaces). Second, GAMMs decompose the EEG amplitude
into a sequence of additive components, thereby affording the analyst a toolkit for separating out
partial effects due to different kinds of predictors (e.g., language group, time, compound frequency,
constituent frequency). Third, GAMMs can capture AR1 autocorrelative processes in the signal, and
therefore protect against anti-conservative p-values and mistakingly taking noise for complex EPR
signatures (as has been shown to occur by Tanner et al., 2013).
We include for analysis only trials that elicited a correct response. The time window analysed was
limited to 0–800 ms, time-locked to the onset of stimulus presentation. Autocorrelations in the resid-
ual error were removed by including in the GAMM an autocorrelation parameter ⇢ = 0.9 for AR1
error for each basic time series in the data (the time series amplitudes for each unique combination of
subject and item). Inclusion of ⇢ was essential for removing most of the autocorrelational structure
from the model’s residuals.

of the brain to English compounds at channel C1.
In what follows, we focus on channel C1, which revealed a pattern of results typical for surrounding
channels. The amplitude of the EEG signal was modeled (without any prior averaging) as an additive
function of Word order (Licit vs. Reversed), Compound Frequency, the Constituent Frequency of
Modifier and of Head, and Participant Group (English, German, Spanish). Proficiency did not reach
significance and did not improve the model fit significantly, so we did not include this predictor in the
final model.
GAMMs currently can only accomodate interactions of smooths with a single factor. In order to
study the interaction of speaker group and word order, we therefore created a new factor GO with
</bodyText>

as levels English:Licit, English:Reversed, German:Licit, German:Reversed, Spanish:Licit, and Span-
ish:Reversed, using treatment contrasts with as reference level English:Reversed. In the parametric
part of the model (the upper half of Table 2), the coefficients for the main effect of GO and its inter-
action with compound frequency are to be interpreted in the familiar way, with the interaction terms
specifying differences in the slope of compound frequency for the non-reference levels of GO.
GO also interacted with the constituent frequencies. For this three-way interaction, we recoded GO
as an ordered factor, which is how the bam function of the MGCV package is instructed to construct
a reference surface (in our implementation, for English:Licit) and difference surfaces for the other
factor levels with respect to the standard compound forms as read by English native speakers.
Table 2 summarizes the GAMM fitted to the amplitude of the EEG signal at channel C1. First consider
the parametric part of the model, presented in the upper half of the table, which concerns the main
effect of GO and its interaction with log-transformed compound frequency. This interaction is sum-
marized in Figure 2. Black lines denote the Licit Word Order condition, grey lines the Reversed Word
Order condition. Compound frequency did not have much of an effect in the Reversed conditions.

For English (solid lines), a compound frequency is present in the licit condition, with greater com-
pound frequencies inducing more negative amplitudes. For German (dashed lines), the slope was
close to zero in both conditions, indicating the absence of a frequency effect. The Spanish speakers
(dotted lines) revealed a regression line with an opposite slope to that for the English speakers in the
Licit condition, and with a much lower intercept. This reversal of the slope, as compared to English,
may be a consequence of the fact that in Spanish, translation equivalents would be expressed with the
opposite constituent order.
The non-parametric part of the model, reported in the lower half of Table 2, handles non-linear effects
in the model, using thin plate regression splines for wiggly curves and tensor product smooths for wig-
gly surfaces. The first row of the non-parametric subtable summarizes a smooth in time for English

licit compounds. This smooth is visualized in the left panel of Figure 3, together with its 95% confi-
dence interval. The model required 8.78 effective degrees of freedom (edf) to capture a (significant)
positive inflection around 300 ms post stimulus onset. (Higher edfs indicate greater wiggliness.) The
next 5 rows in Table 2 describe the difference curves for the remaining levels of GO. The only level
for which this difference curve is significant is Spanish:Licit. The second panel of Figure 3 presents
this difference curve, which required 7.89 effective degrees of freedom. As the difference curve is
significantly above the X-axis around 300 ms post stimulus onset, and significantly below the X-axis
after 600 ms, we conclude that the Spanish speakers reading licit compounds had a higher positivity
around 300 ms compared to the English speakers reading the same compound, combined with more
negative amplitudes after 600 ms post stimulus.

EEG amplitudes were also modulated by an interaction of the constituent frequencies by GO, which
we modeled with a tensor surface for English:Licit and difference tensor surfaces for the other levels
of GO. The second set of 6 rows in Table 2 present the summary statistics, and Figure 3 the smoothed
surfaces. The upper left panel presents the reference smooth for English native speakers reading com-
pounds in their licit order. For channel C1, this surface is not well-supported statistically (p = 0.095),
but at neighboring channels (e.g., Cz, FC1) higher-frequency constituents elicited significantly higher
amplitudes. Interestingly, when the constituents are reversed, significantly more negative amplitudes
for compounds with high constituent frequencies are observed for native English speakers, as shown
in the lower left panel. German speakers show a similar pattern with more negative amplitudes for
both licit and reversed compounds (center panels). The strongest negativities are present for Spanish
speakers in the licit condition (upper right). In the reversed condition, Spanish speakers show a pat-
tern of somewhat increased negativity (lower right) that, however, does not vary much with constituent
frequency.

The final three rows of Table 2 specify the random-effects structure of the model. Random intercepts
for compound were included in order to allow for differences in baseline amplitude across compounds.
For subjects, two random wiggly curves were included. The first models changes in amplitude as
subjects go through the experiment. The second models subject-specific changes over within-trial
time. The random wiggly curves are the nonlinear equivalent of what in the context of a linear mixed-
effects model would be ‘random straight lines’ obtained by combining random intercepts with random
slopes. For EEG data, where amplitude changes non-linearly with time, the flexibility of penalized

The non-native participants performed the lexical decision task with a high level of accuracy. For
the licit compounds, accuracy was comparable to that of native speakers. For reversed compounds,
accuracy dropped slightly, from around 94% to around 88%. From this, we conclude, first, that all
subjects have acquired NNC structures in English, and second, that non-native speakers are more
likely to accept novel noun combinations as English compounds.
Knowledge of whether a two-word combination is in fact licit in English can arise from two sources.
On the one hand, speakers may be familiar with the compound, as evidenced by an effect of compound
frequency. For the native English speakers resonding to licit compounds, an effect of compound fre-

quency was indeed present in the EEG amplitudes. On the other hand, speakers may infer the intended
meaning from the constituents (e.g., English beach ball indexing German Wasserball, ‘water ball’).
Constituent effects were well attested in the EEG amplitudes. Interestingly, for English speakers, con-
stituent frequency effects gave rise to more positive amplitudes in the licit condition (significantly at
neighboring channels) whereas in the reversed condition, amplitudes were more negative for higher-
frequency constituents. In other words, when English speakers are confronted with reversed com-
pounds, which for them are actually novel compounds, the compound frequency effect disappears,
and a constituent frequency effect emerges that is opposite in sign to that for normal compounds.
Of the non-native speakers of English, only the Spanish speakers revealed a compound frequency
effect, with a slope opposite in sign to that for the English speakers. If higher amplitude in the signal
indicates increased processing effort, the effect of the frequency of the intended compound could be
interpreted as facilitating in the Licit Word Order condition in the native speakers but inhibiting in the
Spanish group (and without much effect in the German group). We hypothesize that Spanish speakers
find licit English compounds more difficult precisely because in their native language, the order of
the constituents would have been reversed. It is only these speakers that have a word order conflict to
resolve.
All speakers (non-native as well as English) responding to reversed (i.e., for them, novel) compounds,
show more negative amplitudes for compounds with higher constituent frequencies. We interpret this
as evidence for constituent-driven, decompositional processing. The especially pronounced negativi-
ties for Spanish speakers in the Licit Word Order context (which go hand in hand with a positive slope
for compound frequency) suggest that for these speakers increased processing resources are called
upon to resolve the conflict between English and Spanish constituent order, in spite of native-like
performance in the evaluation of compounds in that condition.
A positive peak around 300 ms post-stimulus was found in all groups in both conditions, and exac-
erbated in the Spanish group in the Licit Word Order condition. This peak could be interpreted as a
P300, indexing attentional resources. El Yagoubi et al. (2008) found that right-headed NNCs in Ital-
ian yielded a greater P300 and interpreted this as evidence that processing this marked (but in Italian
equally grammatical) word order required increased attentional resources. If the P300 observed here
reflects a peak of attentional engagement, we expect its amplitude to predict scores on an Attention
Network Task (Fan et al., 2005) — something we will investigate in the next phase of this study.
With respect to the absence of a significant N400 effect between the Word Order conditions, we first
note that the N400 may vanish due to familiarization, and also to masked priming (Coulson et al.,
2005; Brown and Hagoort, 1993). However, and perhaps more importantly, reversed compounds are
not semantically anomalous. To the contrary, they invite interpretation and, as we have documented,
give rise to constituent-driven processes of interpretation. From this perspective, an N400 would then
characterize the processing of semantic anomalies that cannot be resolved through morphological
processing.

5 Concluding remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999907428571429">
This study set out to investigate (i) whether non-native processing of NNCs results in different ERP
signatures compared to native processing, and (ii) whether non-native processing of NNCs is affected
by constituent order in the mothertongue. Analysis of the EEG amplitudes revealed that English
native speakers read licit compounds using both whole-word information (as indexed by compound
frequency) in congruence with constituent information (as indexed by constituent frequency with
a positive effect) whereas non-native speakers and English speakers reading novel (reversed) com-
pounds resort to decompositional interpretation indexed by a negative effect on amplitudes. Further-

more, Spanish readers undergo interference from the different constituent order possibilities in their
own language, leading to a reversed compound frequency effect and strongly enhanced constituent
frequency effects (with a negative sign) when reading English licit compounds.
This pattern of results is, for native speakers, consistent with the early effects of compound frequency
observed using eye-tracking by, e.g., Kuperman et al. (2008, 2009) and Miwa et al. (2014) for English,
Finnish, and Japanese respectively. The importance of constituent-driven processing for non-native
speakers is reminiscent of the decompositional eye-movement patterns of less-proficient readers re-
ported by Kuperman &amp; Van Dyke (2011).
We conclude with noting that the insights gleaned from the EEG amplitudes would not have been
possible without generalized additive mixed models. At the same time, we believe we are only seeing
the tip of the iceberg. For instance, the model can be improved by allowing the interaction of the con-
stituent frequencies by group and constituent order to vary with time, using a five-way tensor product
smooth. Two considerations have withheld us from following up on this considerably more com-
plex model. First, without specific hypotheses as a guide, interpretation becomes extremely difficult.
Second, we are concerned that with a relative small number of compounds (120), overfitting might
become an issue. For future research specifically addressing the development over time of constituent
(and whole-word) frequency effects, we recommend designs with larger numbers of compounds.

It is now widely accepted that both constituents are activated during processing, at least in non-lexicalised compounds (Jarema, 2006; Zhang et al., 2012).

Headedness plays a specific role in the processing of NNCs, as demonstrated by research on Italian (which crucially features the two word orders in NNCs). Based on a lexical decision task, El Yagoubi et al. (2008) found priming effects induced by the head, independently of its position in the NNC. Headedeness effects are not distinguishable from position-in-the-string effects in languages such as English. For instance, Jarema et al. (1999) observed no difference in the priming of NNCs by the head or the modifier. Here we take this line of research further, by investigating whether headedness in the mothertongue affects the processing of transparent, irreversible NNCs in highly advanced second language learners of English.

Compounds have been extensively studied in the past 40 years from a myriad of viewpoints (Libben and Jarema, 2006; Lieber and Štekauer, 2009).

It is now widely accepted that both constituents are activated during processing, at least in non-lexicalised compounds (Jarema, 2006; Zhang et al., 2012). Noun-noun compounds have also been shown to be processed differently to non-compounds of similar morphological complexity and length, with compounds yielding longer reaction times and different electrophysiological correlates (El Yagoubi et al., 2008).

Here we take this line of research further, by investigating whether headedness in the mothertongue affects the processing of transparent, irreversible NNCs in highly advanced second language learners of English. Event-related potentials (ERPs) can provide insight into the neural activity associated with the processing of compounds. Functional interpretations can be inferred from the temporal and spatial characteristics of electromagnetic activity, and ERP components can sometimes reveal the engagement of the cognitive processes involved. Our approach is this paper is exploratory (Otten and Rugg, 2005) and will focus on identifying differences in the amplitude of the EEG signal that can be traced back to properties of the participants (such as their language background) and properties of the compounds (such as their frequency of occurrence, and the frequencies of occurrence of their constituents). Inferences based on previously identified ERP components will be drawn in the discussion as appropriate. Our research questions are: (i) Does non-native processing of NNCs result in different ERP signatures to native processing? (ii) Is non-native processing of NNCs affected by headedness effects </context>

The experimental session was preceded by a practice session comprising 20 trials, which was repeated until participants could perform the task and procedure with no errors (usually one or two practice sessions sufficed). The EEG was recorded (Neuroscan Synamps2) from 60 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded in a cap based on the extended version of the International 10-20 positioning system (Sharbrough et al., 1991). Additional electrodes were placed on the left and right mastoids. Data were recorded using a central reference electrode placed between Cz and CPz. The ground electrode was positioned between Fz and Fpz. To capture noise articfacts in the EEG signal due to eye movements, electro-oculograms (EOGs) were recorded using electrodes positioned at either side of the eyes, and above and below the left eye.

Second, GAMMs decompose the EEG amplitude into a sequence of additive components, thereby affording the analyst a toolkit for separating out partial effects due to different kinds of predictors (e.g., language group, time, compound frequency, constituent frequency). Third, GAMMs can capture AR1 autocorrelative processes in the signal, and therefore protect against anti-conservative p-values and mistakingly taking noise for complex EPR signatures (as has been shown to occur by Tanner et al., 2013). We include for analysis only trials that elicited a correct response. The time window analysed was limited to 0–800 ms, time-locked to the onset of stimulus presentation. Autocorrelations in the residual error were removed by including in the GAMM an autocorrelation parameter ⇢ = 0.9 for AR1 error for each basic time series in the data (the time series amplitudes for each unique combination of subject and item). Inclusion of ⇢ was essential for removing most of the autocorrelational structure from the model’s residuals. A. parametric coefficients Intercept (English Reversed) Compound Frequen</context>

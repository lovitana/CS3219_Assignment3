<bodyText confidence="0.999894913043478">
One of the great challenges of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) is the multitude of
choices that language gives us for expressing
the same thing in different ways. This is
obviously true when taking other languages
into consideration - the same thought can be
expressed in English, French, Chinese or
Russian, with widely varying results. However,
it is also true when considering a single
language such as English. Light verb
constructions, nominalizations, idioms, slang,
paraphrases, and synonyms all give us myriads
of alternatives for “coining a phrase.” This
causes immense difficulty for NLP systems.
No one has made greater contributions to
advancing the state of the art of lexical
semantics, and its applications to NLP, than
Chuck Fillmore. In this paper we focus on the
central role that FrameNet has played in our
development of SemLink+ and in our current
explorations into event ontologies that can play
a practical role in accurate automatic event
extraction.

2 Detecting events
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999957074074074">
An elusive goal of current NLP systems is the
accurate detection of events – recognizing the
meaningful relations among the topics, people,
places and events buried within text. These
relations can be very complex, and are not
always explicit, requiring subtle semantic
interpretation of the data. For instance, NLP
systems must be able to automatically
recognize that Stock prices sank and The stock
market is falling can be describing the same
event. Such an interpretation relies upon a
recognition of the similarity between sinking
and falling, as well as noting the connection
between stock prices and the stock market,
and, finally, acknowledgment that they are
playing the same role. A key element in event
extraction is the identification of the
participants of an event, such as the initiator of
an action and any parties affected by it.
Basically who did what to whom, when, where,
why and how? Many systems today rely on
semantic role labeling to help identify
participants, and lexical resources that provide
an inventory of possible predicate argument
structures for individual lexical items are
crucial to the success of semantic role labeling
(Palmer,et al., 2010).

3 SemLink+ and Semantic Roles
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819272727273">
SemLink (Palmer, 2009) is an ongoing effort
to map complementary lexical resources:
PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), VerbNet
(Kipper et al., 2008), FrameNet (Fillmore et
al., 2004), and the recently added OntoNotes
(ON) sense groupings (Weischedel, et al.,
2011). They all associate semantic information
with the propositions in a sentence. Each was
created independently with somewhat differing
goals, and they vary in the level and nature of
semantic detail represented. FrameNet is the

most fine-grained with the richest semantics,
VerbNet focuses on syntactically-based
generalizations that carry semantic
implications, and the relatively coarse-grained
PropBank has been shown to provide the most
effective training data for supervised Machine
Learning techniques. Nonetheless, they can be
seen as complementary rather than conflicting,
and together comprise a whole that is greater
than the sum of its parts. SemLink serves as a
platform to unify these resources. The recent
addition of ON sense groupings, which can be
thought of as a more coarse-grained view of
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), provides even
broader coverage for verbs, and a level of
representation that is appropriate for linking
between VerbNet class members and
FrameNet lexical units, as described below.
SemLink unifies these lexical resources at
several different levels. First by providing
type-to-type mappings between the lexical
units for each framework. For PropBank these
are the very coarse-grained rolesets, for
VerbNet they are verbs that are members of
VerbNet classes, and for FrameNet they are the
lexical units associated with each Frame. The
same lemma can have multiple PropBank
rolesets and can be in several VerbNet classes
and FrameNet frames, but always with
different meanings. In general, the mappings
from PropBank to VerbNet or FrameNet tend
to be 1-many, while the mappings between
VerbNet and FrameNet are more likely to be 1-
1. For example, the verb hear has just one
coarse-grained sense in PropBank, with the
following roleset:
Arg0: hearer
Arg1: utterance, sound
Arg2: speaker, source of sound
This roleset maps to both the Discover and See
classes of VerbNet, and the Hear and
Perception_experience frames of FrameNet.
Then, for each lexical unit, SemLink also
supplies a mapping between the semantic roles
of PropBank and VerbNet, as well as the roles
of VerbNet and FrameNet. PropBank uses
very generic labels such as Arg0 and Arg1,
which correspond to Dowty’s Prototypical
Agent and Patient, respectively (Dowty, 1991).
PropBank has up to six numbered arguments
for core verb specific roles and for adjuncts it
has several generally applicable ArgModifiers
that have function tag labels such as: MaNneR,
TeMPoral, LOCation, DIRection, GOaL, etc.
VerbNet uses more traditional linguistic
thematic role labels, with about 30 in total, and
assumes adjuncts (ArgM’s) will be supplied by
PropBank based semantic role labelers.
FrameNet is even more fine-grained and has
frame-specific core and peripheral roles called
Frame Elements for each frame, amounting to
over 2000 individual Frame Element types.
For example, He talked about politics would
receive the following semantic role labels from
each framework.1

Thanks to Chuck Fillmore’s careful
guidance, the rich, meticulously crafted
Frames in FrameNet, with their detailed
descriptions of all possible arguments and their
relations to each other, offer the potential of
providing a foundation for inferencing about
events and their consequences. In addition
FrameNet has from the beginning been
inclusive in its addition of nominal and
adjectival forms to the Frames, which greatly
increases our coverage of all predicating
elements (Bonial, et al., 2014). There is also a
comprehensive FrameNet Constructicon that
painstakingly lists many phrasal constructions,
such as “the Xer, the Yer” that cannot be found
anywhere else (Fillmore, et al., 2012). Many of
these frames, including the constructions,
apply equally well to other languages, as
evidenced by the various efforts to develop
FrameNets in other languages2 promising a
likely benefit to multilingual information

processing as well. Given the close theoretical
ties between PropBank, VerbNet and
FrameNet, it should be possible to bootstrap
from the successful PropBank-based automatic
semantic role labelers to equally accurate
FrameNet and VerbNet annotators, and to
improve overall semantic role labeling
performance (Bauer &amp; Rambow, 2011;
Dipanjan, et al., 2010; Giuglea &amp; Moschitti,
2006; Merlo &amp; der Plas, 2009; Yi, et al., 2007).
That is one of the primary goals of SemLink.
The first release of SemLink (1.1) contained
mappings between these three lexical resources
as well as a set of PropBank instances from the
Wall Street Journal data with mappings to
VerbNet classes and thematic roles (Palmer,
2009). Our most recent release, SemLink 1.2,3
now includes mappings to FrameNet frames
and Frame Elements wherever they are
available (FN version 1.5), as well as ON sense
groupings (Bonial, et al., 2013). The mapping
files between PropBank and VerbNet (version
3.2), and FrameNet have also been checked for
consistency and updated to more accurately
reflect the current relations between these
resources.
This annotated corpus can now be used to
train and evaluate VerbNet Class and
FrameNet Frame classifiers, to explore clusters
of Frame Elements that map to the same
VerbNet and PropBank semantic roles, and to
evaluate approaches to semantic role labeling
that use the type-to-type mappings to bootstrap
VerbNet and FrameNet role labels from
automatic PropBank semantic role labels.

4 Events, Event Types and Subevents
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999951166666667">
Accurate and informative semantic role
labels are an essential component of event
extraction, but, although necessary, they are
not sufficient. Automatic event detection also
requires the ability to distinguish between
events which are truly separate, such as
Yesterday, John was throwing a ball to Mary
and Bill was flying a kite, as opposed to related
events such as John was washing the dishes
and Mary was drying them. The second pair
could be seen as temporally related subevents
of an overall doing the dishes or cleaning up

the kitchen event. It can sometimes be quite
challenging to determine the relationship
between two events. For instance, earthquakes
are quite often associated with the collapse of
buildings, as in the following example, The
quake destroyed parts of Sausalito. All tall
buildings were demolished.
Many readers might agree that the
earthquakes CAUSED the demolishment of the
buildings. However, are the building collapses
also SUBEVENTs of the earthquakes?
Sometimes they happen a few days later, or
immediately, simultaneously with the
earthquake. Are they both subevents? In
general, for accurate event detection, it would
be very useful to know which events must
precede, must follow, or cannot be
simultaneous with, which other events. As
discussed in the 2013 NAACL Events
workshop and this year’s ACL Events
workshop, clear, consistent annotation of
events and their coreference and causal and
temporal relations is a much desired but very
challenging goal (Ikuta &amp; Palmer, 2014). Any
assistance that can be provided by lexical
resources is welcome.
Another very important contribution that
FrameNet has made is in the realm of defining
these kinds of relations, and others, between
frames. Parent-Child Frame to Frame relations
can include Inheritance, Subframe, Perspective
On, Using, Causative Of, Inchoative of, and
there is also a Precedes temporal ordering
relation.
The DEFT working group in Richer Event
Descriptions has recently been exploring
expanding the ACE and ERE event types, and
how they can be mapped onto a broader
ontological context. Exploring the FrameNet
relations that the relevant lexical items
participate in has been most informative. We
first examined the simple LDC ERE
classification of Conflict events, which has
demonstrations and attacks as siblings (ERE
guidelines). We find FrameNet’s classification
of attacks as Hostile-Encounters quite useful,
and have no argument with it having an
Inheritance relation with Intentionally_act, and
a Using relation with Taking_sides.
Demonstrations, on the other hand, come
under the Protest Frame, which has a Using
relation with Taking_sides. The FrameNet

<bodyText confidence="0.999704368421053">
organization of demonstrations and attacks,
although perfectly justifiable, doesn’t map
neatly onto the LDC organization since,
although they are close, they are not siblings.
However, by also considering SUMO (Niles &amp;
Pease, 2001), the Predicate Matrix (de Lacalle ,
et al., 2014), WordNet and VerbNet, we were
able to develop the upper level partial Event
Ontology given in Figure 1, which comfortably
incorporates the ERE and FrameNet relations
within a broader framework, preserving the
key aspects of each.
We are now discussing the ERE Life events,
birth, death, injury, marriage, divorce, etc.,
and FrameNet is again proving to be
inspirational. SemLink+ will encompass our
growing Event Ontology, as well as the
mappings between the resources and the
multiple layers of annotation on the same data.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999968590909091">
Since computers do not interact with and
experience the world the same way humans do,
how could they ever interpret language
describing the world the same way humans do?
That NLP has made as much progress as it has
is truly phenomenal, and there is much more
still that can be done. Rich, detailed, lexical
resources like FrameNet are major stepping
stones that will enable continued
improvements in the automatic representation
of sentences in context. FrameNet, and
WordNet, PropBank, VerbNet and SemLink+,
provide priceless, invaluable information about
myriads of different types of events and the
creative ways in which they can be expressed,
as well as rich details about all of their possible
participants. If we can harness the power of
distributional semantics to help us dynamically
extend and enrich what has already been
manually created, we may find our computers
to be much smarter than we ever imagined
them to be.

For example, the verb hear has just one coarse-grained sense in PropBank, with the following roleset: Arg0: hearer Arg1: utterance, sound Arg2: speaker, source of sound This roleset maps to both the Discover and See classes of VerbNet, and the Hear and Perception_experience frames of FrameNet. Then, for each lexical unit, SemLink also supplies a mapping between the semantic roles of PropBank and VerbNet, as well as the roles of VerbNet and FrameNet. PropBank uses very generic labels such as Arg0 and Arg1, which correspond to Dowty’s Prototypical Agent and Patient, respectively (Dowty, 1991). PropBank has up to six numbered arguments for core verb specific roles and for adjuncts it has several generally applicable ArgModifiers that have function tag labels such as: MaNneR, TeMPoral, LOCation, DIRection, GOaL, etc. VerbNet uses more traditional linguistic thematic role labels, with about 30 in total, and assumes adjuncts (ArgM’s) will be supplied by PropBank based semantic role labelers. FrameNet is even more fine-grained and has frame-specific core and peripheral roles called Frame Elements for each frame, amounting to over 2000 individual Frame Element types. For example, He tal</context>

Nonetheless, they can be seen as complementary rather than conflicting, and together comprise a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. SemLink serves as a platform to unify these resources. The recent addition of ON sense groupings, which can be thought of as a more coarse-grained view of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), provides even broader coverage for verbs, and a level of representation that is appropriate for linking between VerbNet class members and FrameNet lexical units, as described below. SemLink unifies these lexical resources at several different levels. First by providing type-to-type mappings between the lexical units for each framework. For PropBank these are the very coarse-grained rolesets, for VerbNet they are verbs that are members of VerbNet classes, and for FrameNet they are the lexical units associated with each Frame. The same lemma can have multiple PropBank rolesets and can be in se</context>

In addition FrameNet has from the beginning been inclusive in its addition of nominal and adjectival forms to the Frames, which greatly increases our coverage of all predicating elements (Bonial, et al., 2014). There is also a comprehensive FrameNet Constructicon that painstakingly lists many phrasal constructions, such as “the Xer, the Yer” that cannot be found anywhere else (Fillmore, et al., 2012). Many of these frames, including the constructions, apply equally well to other languages, as evidenced by the various efforts to develop FrameNets in other languages2 promising a likely benefit to multilingual information 1 Arg0 maps to Agent maps to Speaker.

However, are the building collapses also SUBEVENTs of the earthquakes? Sometimes they happen a few days later, or immediately, simultaneously with the earthquake. Are they both subevents? In general, for accurate event detection, it would be very useful to know which events must precede, must follow, or cannot be simultaneous with, which other events. As discussed in the 2013 NAACL Events workshop and this year’s ACL Events workshop, clear, consistent annotation of events and their coreference and causal and temporal relations is a much desired but very challenging goal (Ikuta &amp; Palmer, 2014). Any assistance that can be provided by lexical resources is welcome. Another very important contribution that FrameNet has made is in the realm of defining these kinds of relations, and others, between frames. Parent-Child Frame to Frame relations can include Inheritance, Subframe, Perspective On, Using, Causative Of, Inchoative of, and there is also a Precedes temporal ordering relation. The DEFT working group in Richer Event Descriptions has recently been exploring expanding the ACE and ERE event types, and how they can be mapped onto a broader ontological context.

We find FrameNet’s classification of attacks as Hostile-Encounters quite useful, and have no argument with it having an Inheritance relation with Intentionally_act, and a Using relation with Taking_sides. Demonstrations, on the other hand, come under the Protest Frame, which has a Using relation with Taking_sides. The FrameNet 15 organization of demonstrations and attacks, although perfectly justifiable, doesn’t map neatly onto the LDC organization since, although they are close, they are not siblings. However, by also considering SUMO (Niles &amp; Pease, 2001), the Predicate Matrix (de Lacalle , et al., 2014), WordNet and VerbNet, we were able to develop the upper level partial Event Ontology given in Figure 1, which comfortably incorporates the ERE and FrameNet relations within a broader framework, preserving the key aspects of each. We are now discussing the ERE Life events, birth, death, injury, marriage, divorce, etc., and FrameNet is again proving to be inspirational.

Our most recent release, SemLink 1.2,3 now includes mappings to FrameNet frames and Frame Elements wherever they are available (FN version 1.5), as well as ON sense groupings (Bonial, et al., 2013). The mapping files between PropBank and VerbNet (version 3.2), and FrameNet have also been checked for consistency and updated to more accurately reflect the current relations between these resources.

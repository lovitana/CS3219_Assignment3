This paper reports on approaches for automatically predicting a learner’s language proficiency
in Estonian according to the European CEFR scale. We used the morphological and POS tag
information extracted from the texts written by learners. We compared classification and
regression modeling for this task. Our models achieve a classification accuracy of 79% and
a correlation of 0.85 when modeled as regression. After a comparison between them, we
concluded that classification is more effective than regression in terms of exact error and the
direction of error. Apart from this, we investigated the most predictive features for both multi-
class and binary classification between groups and also explored the nature of the correlations
between highly predictive features. Our results show considerable improvement in classification
accuracy over previously reported results and take us a step closer towards the automated
assessment of Estonian learner text.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.999944888888889">
People learn a foreign language for many reasons like: living in a new country, having a general
interest in the language etc., In many of these scenarios, language learners also undertake
exams to get certified for their proficiency in a foreign language. Language proficiency is
typically measured using some standardized scale like the CEFR (Council of Europe, 2001)
in European nations. Evaluating free text responses like essays is one of the standard ways
of assessing the language proficiency of a learner. Traditionally, these student essays were
evaluated by experienced human graders trained for doing the task. With the ever increasing
number of people taking language tests and with the advent of computational tools that can
process language, automatic approaches that reduce human grading effort became a standard
way to assess language proficiency. Automated essay grading is already being used along with
human grading in several assessment exams like Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and
Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). It can also be useful in a placement test that one
may take at a language teaching institute before starting to learn a language at a certain level
or serve as a guiding tool for language learners in self-assessment. Apart from this, automated
approaches can also enable us to identify distinctive features at a proficiency level, thereby
providing us with insights about the process of language acquisition.
While automated assessment is an active area of research for English, approaches for the
automatic proficiency classification of learner essays according to the European CEFR scale
were recently proposed for German (Hancke and Meurers, 2013), Swedish (Östling et al., 2013)
and Estonian (Vajjala and Lõo, 2013). In this paper, we focus on the proficiency classification of
Estonian learner essays. We started with the feature set described in Vajjala and Lõo (2013)
and added more features to the list. We also used a more fine-grained subset of the same base
corpus, consisting of four CEFR proficiency levels. We show that our approach improves the
overall classification accuracy for this task reaching up to 79% for a four-level classification. We
compare this approach with modeling the problem as regression and show that classification
performs better in terms of accuracy and the direction of error. Apart from these, to gain a
better understanding of the modeling process, we also studied the issues of feature selection,
most predictive features for classification between categories and for overall classification, and
correlations between features. In sum, we investigate proficiency classification both from a
prediction as well as an interpretational perspective.
Rest of this paper is organized as follows: we start with an overview of contemporary research
in proficiency classification of free text responses in Section 2 and describe the corpus and
features we used in Section 3. Section 4 describes our experimental setup and explains the
classification and regression experiments we performed along with our results. Section 5 briefly
discusses feature selection and correlational analysis with all the features. Section 6 concludes
the paper with pointers to future work.

<bodyText confidence="0.997918142857143">
Automated Assessment (AA) of learner essays can be useful either as a method of scoring
them by their proficiency or for understanding the distinctive features of language at a given
proficiency level. AA has been active area of research in the field of language testing for a few
decades now. Several assessment exams like GRE, GMAT that have language proficiency as
a component have been using automated assessment systems as one of the scoring methods
along with human graders. These AA systems that are primarily developed for English use a
wide range of linguistic and structural features to score student essays (e.g., Burstein, 2003;

Crossley et al., 2011).

<bodyText confidence="0.999839517241379">
Apart from these approaches whose primary purpose is to predict the learner proficiency, there
have been studies that did a qualitative analysis of distinctive features between proficiency
levels in Second Language Acqusition (SLA) literature. Kyle and Crossley (2014) used a range
of lexical sophistication indices and showed that the measures explain 47.5% of the variance in
holistic scores of lexical proficiency of second language English learners. Characteristics like
lexical richness, syntactic complexity, error patterns of learners and other characteristics too
were studied in the recent past (e.g., Tono, 2000; Lu, 2010, 2012; Vyatkina, 2012). Although
this strand of research is primarily focused on English, recent research has started to focus on
other languages as well (Gyllstad et al., 2014).
With the creation of learner corpora in various European languages, automatic approaches
for classifying learner essays into various proficiency levels began to emerge. Approaches for
morphologically-rich languages also made use of language specific morphological features,
which were not explored before in the case of English. Östling et al. (2013) reported on
a proficiency classification approach for Swedish based on a corpus of 1,700 learner essays
spanning four levels, obtained from the high-school exams conducted at a national level in
Sweden. Along with the features like word length, sentence length, POS tag densities and
corpus based entropy features, they also used spelling and compound splitting error based
features for this task and achieved an overall accuracy of 62% for four level classification.
Hancke and Meurers (2013); Hancke (2013) described a proficiency classification approach
for German based on European CEFR standards using a broad range of lexical, syntactic and
morphological features, considering German language structure into account. For a five level
graded corpus with about 200 texts per level, they achieved a classification accuracy of 64.5%.
Vajjala and Lõo (2013) developed a proficiency classification approach for Estonian learner
corpus and achieved an accuracy of 66% for a three level (A,B,C) corpus consisting of 250 texts
per level, using a collection of POS and morphological features. We extended this work by
adding more features and working with a fine-grained corpus spanning four levels on the CEFR
scale. Further, we modeled the problem as both classification and regression and compared
their performance. We also explored predictive features between categories and inter-feature
correlations.

3 Corpus and Features

3.1 Corpus
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999946">
Our experiments are based on the Estonian Interlanguage Corpus (EIC)1 released online by
Talinn University. It is a corpus of texts written by learners of Estonian as a second or foreign
language. Most of the texts are originally obtained from language examinations conducted by
various government bodies in Estonia. These texts include essays, personal and official letters
and answers to language exercises. The learners come from diverse language backgrounds,
although majority of them are native speakers of Russian. The corpus currently consists of
around 12,000 documents in total2. The grading of this corpus is an ongoing project. In our
analysis, we only used a subset of the whole corpus that is currently annotated with proficiency
level. The version used in this paper was crawled from the EIC website in July 2014. As the

corpus annotation is still under development, the latest version that is available on the web
may have more texts than the version we used3.
The corpus we used in this paper consists of 879 texts in total, belonging to four proficiency
levels A2, B1, B2, C1. Since only one document each was annotated as A1 and C2 respectively
in the corpus, we removed those levels from our experiments. According to the CEFR definitions,
A2 represents a basic language user, B1 and B2 represent independent user and C1 represents a
proficient user.
This corpus was used for Estonian proficiency classification earlier in Vajjala and Lõo (2013).
However, we could not use the same version as the assigned grades changed for the current
version. In the previous version of the corpus, proficiency levels were estimated based on
the meta information collected from teacher or based on the subjective opinion of the data
enterer (Eslon, 2014). The current version of the corpus has proficiency levels estimated by
three qualified professional graders and divided into six CEFR categories instead of three levels
A,B,C as in the older version. Thus, the proficiency level of certain texts got modified in the
process and the current version of proficiency annotation of the corpus is considered precise
and accurate (Eslon, 2014). However, it has to be noted that we do not have access to the
individual grades given by the three graders. We only have the final grade assigned to the text.
We also do not have any information about the inter-annotator agreement about the grades per
text.
The crawled corpus consisted of HTML documents, which were parsed using HtmlUnit4 and
plain-text of the learner writing was extracted using Xpath expressions. Figure 1 shows some
basic statistics about the corpus we used, in terms of the number of texts per category, average
and the range for number of words per text. It can be noticed that the corpus is not evenly
distributed across all levels. Hence, while modeling as classification, we consider this aspect and
report our experiments with two versions of the dataset - one, a balanced version with equal
training samples for all categories, the other an unbalanced version. Further, there is a broad
range for all the categories. We used a normalized version of the dataset for our experiments.
Proficiency Level #Docs Avg. #words Range
A2-level 196 145.9 [23, 636]
B1-level 384 226.3 [39, 1267]

3.3 Features

<bodyText confidence="0.999978">
We started with the feature set described in Vajjala and Lõo (2013) and added a few additional
features, primarily lexical richness features from Lu (2012). In total, our feature set consists of

78 features.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999991975609756">
First, several surface features, such as number of words, number of sentences in a document,
mean word and sentence length in a document were considered. However, as can be seen
from Table 1, the number of words in documents is unequally distributed across the classes. C1
level documents have almost five times more words than A2 on an average. This may create
a bias towards this feature. While this is perfectly valid in a predictive algorithm, we wanted
to understand how much can the morpho-syntactic features contribute to the task without
surface measures. Hence, we excluded these surface features from the feature set. We used
sentence length while doing a replication and comparison with previous work though. We also
briefly present about the variation in accuracy upon including the surface features, in the results
section.
Vajjala and Lõo (2013) described several features considering the morphological complexity of
Estonian. These consist of the average number of nouns and adjectives in a text belonging to
each of the 15 cases that exist in Estonian, average number of verbs belonging to the five moods
(indicative, conditional, imperative, quotative and justive), two tenses (present, past), two
voices (personal, impersonal), three persons (first, second, third), polarity (positive, negative)
and other morphological features. A description of various declensions and conjugations in
Estonian can be found in the Estonian Morphology guide 8. In addition to all these features, we
added the number of compound words per text and number of different cases present in the
text as additional features in this category.
Vajjala and Lõo (2013) had some of the lexical variation measures from Lu (2012) (lexical
variation, noun, adjective, adverb and modifier variation). We additionally implemented the
other lexical richness measures described in Lu (2012) that covered the aspects of lexical density
and diversity. Although these formulae are actually for English, since they are only depended
on the various word counts and since we are not aware of any equivalent formulae for Estonian,
we used the same formulae for Estonian as well. These measures were shown to be good
predictors of learner language quality in English as second language oral narratives. Apart from
this, we used the proportion of various POS tags in the text following previous work.
We also explored word and POS language models initially but since we only reached baseline
performance with them, we discarded that feature set for further experiments. One reason
for the poor performance of word models could be the morphological richness of Estonian
which results in data sparsity for building good language models. For the POS models, we faced
two issues: while using only the base POS tags resulted in all categories looking alike, using
the entire morphological tag resulted in data-sparsity. We did not explore lemma/stem based
language models and factored language models yet. A short experiment considering only a
feature set consisting of morphological suffixes did not result in an improvement in the result.
So, we discarded this feature set too, for the subsequent experiments reported in this paper.
Finally, we did not implement any syntactic features in our approach since we are not aware
of any state-of-the-art parsers for Estonian. We also did not implement any features based on
spelling and grammar error patterns as we are not aware of any off-the-shelf tool we can use
for automatic annotation of learner errors. We also did not verify the output of the Treetagger
for possible errors in tagging, as we are not aware of an automatic approach to detect them.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999649285714286">
Our corpus is a collection of texts spanning multiple proficiency levels. The proficiency levels
can be assumed to be discrete or continuous, and with varying degree of difference between
succeeding levels (i.e., difference between A2 and B1 may be less than that of B1 and B2). This
allows us to conceptualize the problem of proficiency classification as belonging to nominal or
interval or ordinal scales. Accordingly, we investigated this dataset by considering the problem
as classification and regression. We did not explore ordinal representation yet. We used WEKA
(Hall et al., 2009) for training the machine learning models and for feature selection.

4.1 Evaluation Measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999545222222222">
We used multiple evaluation measures based on the choice of learning approaches. We evaluated
classification performance in terms of its prediction accuracy. Additionally, we report the
confusion matrices and F-scores per class to compare the performance with balanced and
unbalanced datasets. For linear regression, we report Pearson correlation and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) as evaluation measures. All the evaluation was performed in a 10-fold
Cross Validation setting.
We are not aware of any direct measure of comparison between classification and regression
approaches using the same data. Hence, we used three measures after rounding off the
regression prediction to the nearest integer value:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99713075">
1. Percentage of exact matches (This is the same as accuracy for classification.)
2. Percentage of instances where the prediction is within one-level of the actual value (This

3. Percentage of errors where the prediction is higher than the actual level. This measure

was considered with the assumption that in a placement testing scenario, assigning a
learner actually belonging to A2 as say, B2 is more undesirable compared to assigning a
B2 learner to A2 level.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999507">
4.2 Modeling as Classification
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999287">
We used the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) implementation in WEKA (Platt,1998) in
all our classification experiments for easy comparison with previous work with these features.
Since the training corpus used in this paper differs from that used in Vajjala and Lõo (2013) in
terms of the grades assigned to the texts, a direct comparison of results is not possible. Hence,
we started with a replication of the classification experiment with the feature set used in their
paper using the new four-level corpus described in Table 1. This resulted in a classification
accuracy of 73.7% (F-score 0.74) using an unbalanced dataset and 72.3% (F-score 0.72) using a
balanced dataset consisting of 92 texts per category. We consider these as our baseline measures
for the rest of this paper.
After establishing this baseline, we tested the model with all our features. The model with all
the features received 79% accuracy for the unbalanced corpus and 76.9% for the balanced
corpus, which is clearly an increase of about 5% over the previously reported feature set. Table
3 shows the confusion matrices for both unbalanced (left) and balanced (right) versions and
Table 4 shows the F-scores per category for both the versions.

It is interesting to note that the unbalanced corpus did not create a particular bias for or against
any one level. However, the balanced version resulted in a drop in accuracy by ∼2%. Though
the prediction accuracy for A2 and C1 clearly increased in the balanced version, this also
resulted in reducing the F-score for both B1 and B2. It is difficult to decide which version of
the corpus is better for classification - balanced or unbalanced, in this case. However, since the
model trained on the unbalanced version results in better accuracy without completely being
skewed towards majority classes, we can perhaps consider it as the better performing model
between the two. While the increase in accuracy compared to what was reported in Vajjala
and Lõo (2013) (67%) can be attributed to the fine-grainedness of the dataset we use now, the
performance improvement between their feature set and ours on the new dataset shows that
the increased accuracy is not entirely a data artifact.
We also trained binary classifiers for all the class combinations to understand if it is easy or
difficult to classify between pairs of classes. Table 5 summarizes the experiments, performed
considering equal instances from both classes in each case, in terms of classification accuracy.

As the table shows, all the binary classifiers achieved accuracies much higher than the four-class
classification accuracy for the balanced corpus (76.9%), excepting (B1 vs B2). This encourages
us to explore a multi-level classification approach like the cascades used in Vajjala and Lõo
(2013) in future, which could result in an improvement over the current accuracy.
Finally, we also verified if adding the surface features (word length and sentence length)

significant.

4.3 Modeling as Regression
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999973454545454">
Another way besides classification is to look at proficiency level prediction as regression. As
mentioned earlier, these proficiency levels can be seen as scores on a numeric scale too, since
proficiency is a continuous variable though the levels assigned are discrete. Further, regression
also allows us to output a prediction on a scale, where it is possible to see predictions that
lie between two discrete levels. Hence, we also modeled proficiency prediction as regression.
We trained a Linear Regression model in WEKA, with default settings9. This regression model
achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.85 and an RMSE of 0.49. For the feature set of Vajjala and
Lõo (2013), the numbers were 0.77 and 0.58 respectively. Since a majority of previous research
on this problem treated it as classification, we have no comparable results on regression. One
related result is that of Hancke (2013), who reported a Pearson correlation of 0.78 and RMSE
of 0.68 for a German proficiency assessment dataset consisting of 5 levels.

4.4 Comparing Classification and Regression

As mentioned in Section 4.1, we compare classification and regression in terms of exact and
within one level prediction accuracy and in terms of the direction of error. Table 6 shows the
comparison between the performance of classification and regression in terms of these measures.
As it can be seen from the table, both classification and regression perform comparably in
terms of within one level accuracy. However, classification seems to work slightly better than
regression in terms of exact accuracy as well as the direction of error.

While the above experiments will let us conclude about the efficiency of the features to predict
CEFR levels accurately, understanding what features play a significant role in distinguishing
between levels is interesting from a general linguistic perspective. Further, the question of how
much can we predict with how few interpretable features is interesting from an application
perspective. Hence, we investigated feature selection approaches and correlations between
features. We used three feature selection methods implemented in WEKA and built classifiers
with these extracted feature subsets. The three methods differ in their approach to feature
selection. They are:

5.2 Predictive Features between Categories

As a final experiment, we investigated the most predictive features between categories. The
motivation for this exploration has been to understand if there is a change in the features that
are more useful, as the proficiency increased. One hypothesis could be that the morphological
features are more predictive between lower proficiency levels and lexical richness features like
TTR will be more predictive at higher proficiency levels. While beginning to learn Estonian,
learners may have issues with its morphological complexity. But, as they become more familiar
and proficient with the language, the effect of morphology may diminish and that of lexical
richness may grow. Table 10 lists the top-5 most predictive features for binary classification
between proficiency levels going from least to highest ranked in terms of their Information Gain.

by the lexical richness features. While we do not have any intuitions about the reasons for
this morphology -&gt; lexical richness -&gt; morphology turn with the increase in proficiency, SLA
research may be able to offer some perspectives on this. It would be interesting to combine
computational modeling with SLA to develop an interpretable model of proficiency assessment,
for which this research could a good starting point. We did not check whether this list of top-5
features varies depending on the size of the sample chosen for the analysis. To estimate the top
features in this case, we used all the data available for the chosen categories.

6 Conclusions and Outlook
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999455">
To conclude, we built models for automatic proficiency classification of Estonian learner texts
based on the CEFR scale. We used a collection of morphological and POS tag density based
features including lexical richness measures from English SLA research. The best model reported
in this paper reaches a prediction accuracy of 79%. Our results show a substantial improvement
over the previously reported results for Estonian and are also considerably higher than the
accuracies reported on this task for other languages (German and Swedish). We can conclude
from our experiments that this linguistic modeling of proficiency holds promise in the direction
of developing an automatic proficiency assessment system for Estonian.
The nature of the CEFR categories allows us to model the problem as being on different scales.
So, we considered nominal and interval scales and modeled the problem as both classification
and regression. Comparing both of them in terms of 3 evaluation measures, we concluded that
we get slightly better results by treating proficiency assessment on CEFR scale as classification
instead of regression.
We experimented with feature selection strategies to understand how far can we get with how
few features and found that we can reach almost the same accuracy with a small subset of
27 features. Along with this, we also did a correlational analysis between features and our
experiments showed that most of the features are highly correlated with each other. We are yet
to develop a solution to deal with this issue.
It has to be noted that we looked at only one dimension of proficiency in this set of experiments,
ignoring aspects of syntax, discourse, learner errors, relation of the text to the question asked
etc. Also, since we ignored the possibility of tagging errors by TreeTagger, we need to caution
that the results need to be interpreted keeping the tool in context. However, despite these two
limitations, we believe our experiments still demonstrate the value of using language specific
linguistic information for performing proficiency classification of Estonian learner text.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.949313">
6.1 Outlook
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999857">
We are currently working on assessing what models are statistically different from each other
using significance testing and by studying the fold-wise difference in a 10-fold cross-validation
setup along with average performance difference between models. This may provide us a better
way to compare various prediction models when the performance difference is small and also
understand the effect of sampling of instances per fold on the performance of the models.
The dataset is still under development and it would be interesting to see how far can we get
with the current feature set, when more annotated data becomes available in future. Although
the results appear very promising at the moment, there is a lot of scope for improvement
and exploration of new feature groups. Our initial experiments with n-gram models failed,
but exploring factored language models and using data-driven word-frequency, spelling error

and suffix-frequency features may perhaps be more useful for the task. Further, subject to
the availability of required tools, we plan to explore the role of syntactic features of texts in
proficiency classification.
From a modeling perspective, exploring cascade approaches like the ones in (Vajjala and Lõo,
2013) may help in improving the accuracies further. Investigating other learning algorithms
and considering the dataset as ordinal - are other interesting directions that could be explored.
Finally, since the results clearly establish the impact of morphological features for this task, it
would be interesting to verify if this is the case for other morphologically rich languages where
such learner corpora are available.

We used the morphological and POS tag information extracted from the texts written by learners. We compared classification and regression modeling for this task. Our models achieve a classification accuracy of 79% and a correlation of 0.85 when modeled as regression. After a comparison between them, we concluded that classification is more effective than regression in terms of exact error and the direction of error. Apart from this, we investigated the most predictive features for both multiclass and binary classification between groups and also explored the nature of the correlations between highly predictive features.

The proficiency levels can be assumed to be discrete or continuous, and with varying degree of difference between succeeding levels (i.e., difference between A2 and B1 may be less than that of B1 and B2). This allows us to conceptualize the problem of proficiency classification as belonging to nominal or interval or ordinal scales. Accordingly, we investigated this dataset by considering the problem as classification and regression. We did not explore ordinal representation yet. We used WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) for training the machine learning models and for feature selection. 4.1 Evaluation Measures We used multiple evaluation measures based on the choice of learning approaches.

This regression model achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.85 and an RMSE of 0.49. For the feature set of Vajjala and Lõo (2013), the numbers were 0.77 and 0.58 respectively. Since a majority of previous research on this problem treated it as classification, we have no comparable results on regression. One related result is that of Hancke (2013), who reported a Pearson correlation of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.68 for a German proficiency assessment dataset consisting of 5 levels. 4.4 Comparing Classification and Regression As mentioned in Section 4.1, we compare classification and regression in terms of exact and within one level prediction accuracy and in terms of the direction of error. Table 6 shows the comparison between the performance of classification and regression in terms of these measures.

While suffixes are indicated in the lemma column separated by a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; symbol, compound words are separated by an underscore. For example, in the above sentence, there are two compound words - Tänapäeva (täna + päev ⇒ today + day = nowadays) and abivahend (abi + vahend ⇒ help + tool = helping tool/aid) 3.3 Features We started with the feature set described in Vajjala and Lõo (2013) and added a few additional features, primarily lexical richness features from Lu (2012). In total, our feature set consists of 7http://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/morfliides/seletus 117 78 features. First, several surface features, such as number of words, number of sentences in a document, mean word and sentence length in a document were considered. However, as can be seen from Table 1, the number of words in documents is unequally distributed across the classes. C1 level documents have almost five times more words than A2 on an average. This may create a bias towards this feature. While this is perfectly valid in a predictive algorithm, we wanted to understand how much can the morph</context>

A description of various declensions and conjugations in Estonian can be found in the Estonian Morphology guide 8. In addition to all these features, we added the number of compound words per text and number of different cases present in the text as additional features in this category. Vajjala and Lõo (2013) had some of the lexical variation measures from Lu (2012) (lexical variation, noun, adjective, adverb and modifier variation). We additionally implemented the other lexical richness measures described in Lu (2012) that covered the aspects of lexical density and diversity. Although these formulae are actually for English, since they are only depended on the various word counts and since we are not aware of any equivalent formulae for Estonian, we used the same formulae for Estonian as well. These measures were shown to be good predictors of learner language quality in English as second language oral narratives. Apart from this, we used the proportion</context>

According to the CEFR definitions, A2 represents a basic language user, B1 and B2 represent independent user and C1 represents a proficient user.

More detailed information on what each tag means can be found on the morpho-syntactic categories description for the Tartu Morphologically Disambiguated Corpus7. While suffixes are indicated in the lemma column separated by a &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; symbol, compound words are separated by an underscore. For example, in the above sentence, there are two compound words - Tänapäeva (täna + päev ⇒ today + day = nowadays) and abivahend (abi + vahend ⇒ help + tool = helping tool/aid) 3.3 Features We started with the feature set described in Vajjala and Lõo (2013) and added a few additional features, primarily lexical richness features from Lu (2012). In total, our feature set consists of 7http://www.cl.ut.ee/korpused/morfliides/seletus 117 78 features. First, several surface features, such as number of words, number of sentences in a document, mean word and sentence length in a document were considered. However, as can be seen from Table 1, the number of words in documents is unequally distributed across the classes. C1 level documents have almost five times more words than A2 on an average. This may create a bias towards this feature. While this is p</context>

A description of various declensions and conjugations in Estonian can be found in the Estonian Morphology guide 8. In addition to all these features, we added the number of compound words per text and number of different cases present in the text as additional features in this category. Vajjala and Lõo (2013) had some of the lexical variation measures from Lu (2012) (lexical variation, noun, adjective, adverb and modifier variation). We additionally implemented the other lexical richness measures described in Lu (2012) that covered the aspects of lexical density and diversity. Although these formulae are actually for English, since they are only depended on the various word counts and since we are not aware of any equivalent formulae for Estonian, we used the same formulae for Estonian as well. These measures were shown to be good predictors of learner language quality in English as second languag</context>

Percentage of errors where the prediction is higher than the actual level. This measure was considered with the assumption that in a placement testing scenario, assigning a learner actually belonging to A2 as say, B2 is more undesirable compared to assigning a B2 learner to A2 level. 4.2 Modeling as Classification We used the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) implementation in WEKA (Platt,1998) in all our classification experiments for easy comparison with previous work with these features. Since the training corpus used in this paper differs from that used in Vajjala and Lõo (2013) in terms of the grades assigned to the texts, a direct comparison of results is not possible. Hence, we started with a replication of the classification experiment with the feature set used in their paper using the new four-level corpus described in Table 1. This resulted in a classification accuracy of 73.7% (F-score 0.74) using an unbalanced dataset and 72.3% (F-score 0.72) using a balanced dataset consisting of 92 texts per category. We consider these as our baseline measures for the rest of this paper. After establishing this baseline, we tested the model with all our features. The model </context>
<context position="22400" citStr="Vajjala and Lõo (2013)" startWordPosition="3438" endWordPosition="3441">ion resulted in a drop in accuracy by ∼2%. Though the prediction accuracy for A2 and C1 clearly increased in the balanced version, this also resulted in reducing the F-score for both B1 and B2. It is difficult to decide which version of the corpus is better for classification - balanced or unbalanced, in this case. However, since the model trained on the unbalanced version results in better accuracy without completely being skewed towards majority classes, we can perhaps consider it as the better performing model between the two. While the increase in accuracy compared to what was reported in Vajjala and Lõo (2013) (67%) can be attributed to the fine-grainedness of the dataset we use now, the performance improvement between their feature set and ours on the new dataset shows that the increased accuracy is not entirely a data artifact. We also trained binary classifiers for all the class combinations to understand if it is easy or difficult to classify between pairs of classes. Table 5 summarizes the experiments, performed considering equal instances from both classes in each case, in terms of classification accuracy. Classes Used Classification Accuracy A2 vs B1 83.2% A2 vs B2 92.4% A2 vs C1 98.4% B1 vs</context>

As mentioned earlier, these proficiency levels can be seen as scores on a numeric scale too, since proficiency is a continuous variable though the levels assigned are discrete. Further, regression also allows us to output a prediction on a scale, where it is possible to see predictions that lie between two discrete levels. Hence, we also modeled proficiency prediction as regression. We trained a Linear Regression model in WEKA, with default settings9. This regression model achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.85 and an RMSE of 0.49. For the feature set of Vajjala and Lõo (2013), the numbers were 0.77 and 0.58 respectively. Since a majority of previous research on this problem treated it as classification, we have no comparable results on regression. One related result is that of Hancke (2013), who reported a Pearson correlation of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.68 for a German proficiency assessment dataset consisting of 5 levels. 4.4 Comparing Classification and Regression As mentioned in Section 4.1, we compare classification and regression in terms of exact and within one level prediction accuracy and in terms of the direction of error. Table 6 shows the comparison between t</context>

Although the results appear very promising at the moment, there is a lot of scope for improvement and exploration of new feature groups. Our initial experiments with n-gram models failed, but exploring factored language models and using data-driven word-frequency, spelling error 124 and suffix-frequency features may perhaps be more useful for the task. Further, subject to the availability of required tools, we plan to explore the role of syntactic features of texts in proficiency classification. From a modeling perspective, exploring cascade approaches like the ones in (Vajjala and Lõo, 2013) may help in improving the accuracies further. Investigating other learning algorithms and considering the dataset as ordinal - are other interesting directions that could be explored. Finally, since the results clearly establish the impact of morphological features for this task, it would be interesting to verify if this is the case for other morphologically rich languages where such learner corpora are available.

With the creation of learner corpora in various European languages, automatic approaches for classifying learner essays into various proficiency levels began to emerge. Approaches for morphologically-rich languages also made use of language specific morphological features, which were not explored before in the case of English. Östling et al.

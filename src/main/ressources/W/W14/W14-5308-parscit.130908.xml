We discuss the notion of language and dialect-specific search in the context of audio indexing. A system
is described where users can find dialect or language-specific pronunciations of Afghan placenames in
Dari and Pashto. We explore the efficacy of a phonetic speech recognition system employed in this task.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978716125">
The Audio Gazetteer hotspotting tool was developed by MITRE (2012) and employs the Nexidia
phonetic speech recognition engine (Gavalda and Schlueter, 2010) in several languages, including Dari
(the Afghan variety of Persian) and Pashto, the two main languages of Afghanistan. These languages
are both members of the Iranian language family and share a number of phonetic characteristics (Miller
et al., 2013). This tool enables a user to load audio clips and to search them for words contained within
them using one of three methods: the Dari or Pashto alphabets, a Romanization scheme, or phonetics in
SAMPA (Wells, 1997). Such a search will yield each starting timepoint in an audio file where the system
has identified the term being searched, along with a number between 0 and 100 indicating the level of
confidence the system has in its determination. While terms of any kind can be searched, the system
provides additional mapping capabilities for placenames.
Audio hotspotting, also known as keyword spotting or audio indexing, is a form of information re-
trieval employing speech recognition that is used for quickly identifying passages of interest within
audio files. It can be used to identify calls of interest in call centers, or to explore reports of natural
disasters or political crises in the media. There are two main approaches to audio hotspotting; one in-
volves speech-to-text (STT), also known as large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR),
and the other employs phonetic speech recognition.
STT ingests speech and outputs orthographic text. To do this, it requires language-specific acoustic
and language models mediated by a pronunciation model or dictionary that maps words to phonetic
forms. The output text transcript can then be mined for terms of interest. Raytheon’s BBN Broadcast
Monitoring System is an example of such a system (Raytheon, 2012). One liability of this approach is
the need to establish the vocabulary, upon which the language and pronunciation models depend, up-
front. That means that one cannot easily search for terms that have not been programmed into the system
beforehand. This is an especially challenging impediment when confronting natural disasters and polit-
ical crises in regions with towns and personalities whose names are “out of vocabulary” (OOV).
Phonetic speech recognition uses language-specific acoustic models directly; allowing users to query
phonetic strings, possibly with the aid of a pronunciation model allowing orthographic search. The
ability to query phonetic strings removes the OOV problem; any string that can be composed of the
phonemes of a particular language can be searched. While this technology is useful for keyword spot-
ting, it cannot be used to generate a meaningful orthographic transcript of speech, due to its lack of a
language model.

Our purpose is to explore the feasibility of using phonetic speech recognition technology to explore
subtle dialect and language differences, with the ultimate aim of enabling language or dialect specific
search. In such a scenario, a user is not simply interested in finding a particular term of interest, he is
also interested in the sociolinguistic characteristics of the speaker of that term of interest.
Various researchers have performed promising experiments using STT to explore phonetic variation.
These experiments utilize STT in forced alignment mode; that is, given a pre-existing orthographic tran-
script, they ask the recognizer to focus on deciding which pronunciation among a finite set supplied by
the researcher maps best onto particular audio exemplars. Fox (2006) used this technique to examine
several realizations of syllable-final /s/1 in Spanish including [s], [h] and deletion, while Wester et al.
(2001) explored variable deletion of /n/, /r/ and /t/ in Dutch, as well as schwa-insertion and deletion.
Both demonstrated promising agreement between the STT-based approaches and human coding.
In contrast, the phonetic speech recognizer employed here requires neither an orthographic transcript,
nor a predetermined set of phonetic variants from which to choose. For that reason, we felt it offered a
flexible platform from which to explore phonetic variation, and thus enabled employing knowledge of
that variation to perform dialect and language-specific search for Dari and Pashto.

2 Data collection and transcription
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999606608695652">
We developed an interview protocol consisting of three components: a sociolinguistic background in-
terview, a map task and a word list. This interview was designed to elicit Afghan placename data from
Afghans residing in the United States whose native language was either Dari or Pashto. Speakers bilin-
gual in Dari and Pashto were interviewed in both languages sequentially. Seven Dari and three Pashto
interviews, comprising approximately six hours in total, were digitally recorded and later downsampled
to 16 MHz with 16-bit precision.
The purpose of the sociolinguistic background interview was to establish the language and dialect
profile of each speaker. Where possible, it was conducted in the speaker’s native language, and estab-
lished the location and duration of each place where he or she resided. In addition, the interview estab-
lished the location and language of instruction of each school attended, as well as the language and
dialect used with family members and friends. The interview inquired about all the languages and dia-
lects both spoken and understood by the speakers.
The purpose of the map task was to gather subjects’ pronunciations of placenames in Afghanistan in
a casual style. A large colored map of Afghanistan, using native lettering, was placed before the subjects
and they were asked to explain in Dari or Pashto how to get to and from various points.
The final part of the interview involved reading a word list in Dari or Pashto containing the names of
over 200 placenames, including provinces, provincial capitals, other large towns, administrative divi-
sions, regions, mountain ranges, passes, bodies of water, airports and deserts. In Pashto interviews, each
placename was read both by itself for the direct case and in frames designed to elicit the oblique and
ablative cases. As a result of the three-part interview, we obtained several tokens of many placenames,
along a scale of more casual style in the sociolinguistic and map tasks to more formal in the word list.
The placenames in each audio file were transcribed using Praat (Boersma, 2001). Up to five of the
following transcription tiers were used:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.934582">
• English: one spelling for each placename was used as an index for each utterance of a given
place, regardless of any particularities in individual utterances.
• Native: Pashto or Dari spelling.
• Phonetic: fairly broad transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
• Language: Dari or Pashto. In general, a given task was in one language at a time. However,
when working with bilingual subjects, they would occasionally explicitly remark on the pro-
nunciation of the placename in the other language, so it was necessary to indicate the language
for each placename.
• Case: for Pashto, indication of whether the particular utterance was in the direct, oblique or
ablative case.
1 Square brackets [] are used for allophones or sequences when no particular phonemic claims are being made;
slashes // are used for phonemes.

<bodyText confidence="0.999991714285714">
The purpose of the phonetic transcription was to represent a human phonetic judgment that could be
compared to the hypotheses of the phonetic speech recognition engine. In its documentation, Nexidia
provides separate phoneme inventories in SAMPA for Dari and Pashto2. Sometimes Nexidia does not
provide a symbol to express certain distinctions. For example, a schwa [ə] is provided for Pashto, but
not Dari. Schwa is a phoneme in Pashto; however, in Dari it is a possible allophone of some short vowels.
In order to facilitate experimentation with the system, in the course of phonetic transcription of a given
language, we limited ourselves to the speech recognizer’s phoneme inventory for that language.

3 Placename pronunciation variation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9922945">
The field of toponym resolution attempts to identify which particular place, or geocode, a given place-
name refers to: for example, in some contexts “London” may refer to a place in England; in others, to a
place in Canada. Research in this field has primarily focused on clues in surrounding text or audio to
disambiguate such placenames (Leidner, 2007; Buscaldi, 2010). To our knowledge, pronunciation var-
iation in placenames has not yet been exploited to assist in disambiguation.
Pronunciation of placenames is well known to vary; indeed one example of this is the phenomenon
known as “local pronunciation” (Forster, 1981). Some common examples from the English-speaking
world include Cairo [kero], Illinois vs. Cairo [kajro], Egypt, and Houston [hawstən] Street in New York
City vs. Houston [hjustən], Texas. The notion of local pronunciation is even more salient in a bilingual
society; for example, French-speaking inhabitants of Montreal call their city [mɔ̃real], while English-
speaking residents say [mʌntriɒl], not to mention Americans, who might say [mɑntriɔl].
In Afghanistan, Pashto and Dari are the principal languages among many other languages spoken
(Farhadi, 1955; MacKenzie, 1959). Pashto and Dari-speaking communities are both located throughout
the country, so it is very common for placenames to have Pashto and Dari variants, as well as variants
for particular dialects of each language.
Table 1 illustrates some variation within Dari pronunciation of placenames that we encountered. This
variation is not limited to placenames; in fact, each of the phonetic phenomena has been reported by
Farhadi (1955), and one variant of each word may be deemed formal and the other colloquial.

sentences in the past tense, and the ablative (also known as oblique II) is used in certain prepositional
constructions meaning “from” (Penzl, 1955). Not all placenames exhibit variation based on case. Inter-
estingly, the words that do feature a distinct oblique case take a plural ending. One interview subject
suggested that in that case, the word may be interpreted as a group of people or tribe.

<bodyText confidence="0.999545">
As can be seen in Table 4, the vowel systems of Dari and Pashto differ somewhat. Dari generally
employs a more rounded long a, which we can abstractly label /ā/, compared to Pashto. That is, Dari
often uses /ɒ/ in contrast to Pashto /a/. The SAMPA provided by Nexidia for each language only contains
one /ā/ per language, so it is not possible to assess the system’s efficacy at recognizing the rounded or
unrounded variant by searching within one language; however, a method involving crosslingual search
will be discussed below. In addition, future research will aim to measure the acoustic properties of the
two varieties of /ā/.
With regard to consonants, Pashto has a retroflex /I/, while Dari does not. In Kunar, the Pashto /I/
corresponds to Dari /r/. Note, however, that when speaking Pashto as a second language, Dari speakers
replace Pashto /I/ with /l/ more often than /r/ (Miran, 1969). Dari preserves the Arabic voiceless uvular
stop /q/, in contrast to Pashto, which generally employs /k/ in words derived from Arabic spelled with
the letter ق (Penzl, 1955).

4 Assessment technique
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999875125">
Precision and recall are the most common measures for assessing quality in the context of audio hotspot-
ting (Hu et al., 2012). We employ these metrics in two scenarios: dialect-agnostic and dialect-specific
search. In the dialect-agnostic case, one would search for an orthographic term, for example Lashkar
Gah, and calculate precision (true positives/(true positives + false positives)) based on how many of the
recalled terms were in fact Lashkar Gah, and calculate recall (true positives/(true positives + false neg-
atives)) based on how many of the actual Lashkar Gah’s in the file being searched were identified. This
method provides a way of evaluating the efficacy of a given system to retrieve audio of interest when
one’s primary concern is the place or term in question, regardless of the pronunciation that was used.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.997071">
71
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999778076923077">
We modify the scoring method in the dialect-specific case, in which we are focused on pronunciation.
Consider for example, the two common pronunciations of Lashkar Gah in Pashto: [laxkarga] and
[laʂkarɡa]. In this case, when calculating precision, if one searches for [laxkarga] and [laʂkarɡa] is re-
trieved, it is just as wrong as if Kabul were retrieved (variable scoring, by incorporation of approaches
such as Nerbonne and Heeringa (2010), will be considered in the future). For calculating recall, the
universe of Lashkar Gah’s is limited to those whose pronunciation matches the search term.
There is some pronunciation variation that does not necessarily represent dialect variation, and should
be considered “under the radar” for the purposes of a dialect-specific search. In the example above,
either of the first two vowels could be [ə] instead of [a]. For this reason, we introduce the notion of
equivalence classes to enable us to give equal “correct” scores for example to both [laxkarga] and
[ləxkarɡa] when searching for [laxkarga].
This scoring method provides a way of evaluating a given system’s sensitivity to pronunciation dif-
ferences. If a system proves adept at such a task, it can be employed in two related tasks:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9998475">
• Language-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular language
• Dialect-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular dialect or accent
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.999939545454545">
There is a large literature on language, speaker and dialect identification (Biadsy, 2011). Most of
these methods are designed to emit a judgment as to language, speaker or dialect, based on a given audio
sample, which might be useful in various kinds of batch processing. Another approach to accent and
nativeness judgment is described by Weinberger and Kunath (2011). In this approach, audio is first
reduced to a human-made phonetic transcription that is then mined for clues as to dialect and accent.
The work described here may be situated between automatic techniques based on audio and post-hoc
techniques focused on transcriptions. Our method is designed for users interacting with a given audio
sample; one that is likely to contain a mix of speakers, languages or dialects. Also, in contrast to statis-
tical approaches which may appear as a “black box” to end-users, our approach allows users to itera-
tively and interactively develop hypotheses as to the association of specific pronunciations with lan-
guages, dialects or speakers.

5 Dialect Search
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999281857142857">
In this section, we contrast performance on dialect-specific vs. dialect-agnostic searches. Suppose in
Dari we are interested in finding speakers who use the pronunciation [qalaEnaw] instead of [qala?Enaw]
for the town Qalah-ye Now ﻮﻧ ﮫﻌﻠﻗ. In this case, we are focused on the application of the phonetic process
/a?/ → [a]. The most salient aspect of this is the presence of the vowel [a] rather than [a] in the second
syllable. Consequently, we are unconcerned about other forms of variation we may encounter, such as
variation between [q] and [k], and [E] and [e]. We therefore contrast the following two equivalence
classes for this experiment as shown in Table 5:
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.7643896">

When we search for a “no compensatory lengthening” pronunciation, we have a correct answer when
we retrieve any one of the “no compensatory lengthening” pronunciations, and equivalently for the
“compensatory lengthening” pronunciations. Table 6 provides results for precision and recall on this
search above two levels of phonetic recognizer confidence:

As expected, recall is better with lower confidence and precision is better with higher confidence.
Note that when searching for [qala?Enaw], [qalaEnaw] is not retrieved above confidence 60. However,
when searching for [qalaEnaw], [qala?Enaw] is sometimes retrieved above that confidence level. This
asymmetric performance is reflected in the higher precision values for [qala?Enaw] as compared to [qal-
aEnaw].
Table 7 presents data for a dialect-agnostic search for Qalah-ye Now. For this search, we are not
concerned about the particular pronunciation, so any pronunciation of the place in question will count
as correct. As can be seen, this perspective causes precision to increase for [qalaEnaw].

6 Crosslingual Search
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999216833333333">
Crosslingual search is treated as a form of query expansion by Hu et al. (2012) and its efficacy as well
as algorithms for its implementation in the domain of placenames are discussed by Joshi et al. (2008).
We adduce crosslingual search as a tool for assessing language-specific search. For example, if we
search for Kabul using the Pashto engine, to what extent will we retrieve Pashto utterances of that place
as opposed to Dari utterances, and vice versa? If the Pashto engine is good at picking up Pashto to the
exclusion of Dari utterances of a placename, it may be an effective tool for language-specific search.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996092">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998558307692308">
We performed a set of experiments to assess this capability. First, we performed a search that was
agnostic with respect to language and dialect. This means that in a search for Kabul in Pashto, we give
credit for both Pashto and Dari tokens of Kabul that are retrieved, regardless of their particular pronun-
ciations. Next, we performed language-specific searches in both Dari and Pashto. When searching in a
given language, we only give credit for retrievals in that language. Note that when we performed lan-
guage-specific search, we were dialect-agnostic. That is, we gave credit for a retrieval provided it was
in the language being searched for, regardless of the particular pronunciation used.
The first term used for both language-agnostic and language-specific search was IPA [kabul]. Note
that due to details of the Nexidia engine, the actual SAMPA strings used were [k A: b O l] for Dari and
[k A b u l] for Pashto. The symbols for /ā/ and /u/ in each language are arbitrarily different as indicated
in Table 10. While IPA symbols (and their SAMPA equivalents) are theoretically absolute values in
acoustic or articulatory space, in practice, they often adhere to arbitrary conventions for transcription of
a particular language.

agnostic, so credit was given as long as the token was in the searched-for language, regardless of its
pronunciation.

As we can see from these results, the Dari engine has better precision and recall on the language-
agnostic search, in contrast to the Pashto engine, whose recall is better on language-specific search. This
can be interpreted as follows: the Dari engine is more versatile and can pick up Pashto, whereas the
Pashto engine is more specific to Pashto and does not pick up Dari as well.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999506">
We have achieved some success searching for language and dialect-specific pronunciations using the
Audio Gazetteer tool. A future challenge will be to identify dialect-specific toponyms automatically
from a gazetteer. Our results are encouraging for the exploitation of pronunciation variation in toponym
resolution and perhaps speaker identification. While dialect-specific results are often not as precise as
searches that are agnostic as to language or dialect, in effect because we are “raising the bar” for what

cessed through the system in order to establish its capabilities more clearly.

This scoring method provides a way of evaluating a given system’s sensitivity to pronunciation differences. If a system proves adept at such a task, it can be employed in two related tasks: • Language-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular language • Dialect-specific search: find tokens of a given word uttered in a particular dialect or accent There is a large literature on language, speaker and dialect identification (Biadsy, 2011). Most of these methods are designed to emit a judgment as to language, speaker or dialect, based on a given audio sample, which might be useful in various kinds of batch processing. Another approach to accent and nativeness judgment is described by Weinberger and Kunath (2011). In this approach, audio is first reduced to a human-made phonetic transcription that is then mined for clues as to dialect and accent. The work described here may be situated between automatic techniques based on audio and post-hoc techniques focused on transcriptions. Our method is designed for users interacting with </context>

In order to facilitate experimentation with the system, in the course of phonetic transcription of a given language, we limited ourselves to the speech recognizer’s phoneme inventory for that language. 3 Placename pronunciation variation The field of toponym resolution attempts to identify which particular place, or geocode, a given placename refers to: for example, in some contexts “London” may refer to a place in England; in others, to a place in Canada. Research in this field has primarily focused on clues in surrounding text or audio to disambiguate such placenames (Leidner, 2007; Buscaldi, 2010). To our knowledge, pronunciation variation in placenames has not yet been exploited to assist in disambiguation. Pronunciation of placenames is well known to vary; indeed one example of this is the phenomenon known as “local pronunciation” (Forster, 1981). Some common examples from the English-speaking world include Cairo [kero], Illinois vs. Cairo [kajro], Egypt, and Houston [hawstən] Street in New York City vs. Houston [hjustən], Texas. The notion of local pronunciation is even more salient in a bilingual society; for example, French-speaking inhabitants of Montreal call their city [mɔ̃real</context>

In such a scenario, a user is not simply interested in finding a particular term of interest, he is also interested in the sociolinguistic characteristics of the speaker of that term of interest. Various researchers have performed promising experiments using STT to explore phonetic variation. These experiments utilize STT in forced alignment mode; that is, given a pre-existing orthographic transcript, they ask the recognizer to focus on deciding which pronunciation among a finite set supplied by the researcher maps best onto particular audio exemplars. Fox (2006) used this technique to examine several realizations of syllable-final /s/1 in Spanish including [s], [h] and deletion, while Wester et al. (2001) explored variable deletion of /n/, /r/ and /t/ in Dutch, as well as schwa-insertion and deletion. Both demonstrated promising agreement between the STT-based approaches and human coding. In contrast, the phonetic speech recognizer employed here requires neither an orthographic transcript, nor a predetermined set of phonetic variants from which to choose. For that reason, we felt it offered a flexible platform from which to explore phonetic variation</context>

These languages are both members of the Iranian language family and share a number of phonetic characteristics (Miller et al., 2013). This tool enables a user to load audio clips and to search them for words contained within them using one of three methods: the Dari or Pashto alphabets, a Romanization scheme, or phonetics in SAMPA (Wells, 1997).

With regard to consonants, Pashto has a retroflex /I/, while Dari does not. In Kunar, the Pashto /I/ corresponds to Dari /r/. Note, however, that when speaking Pashto as a second language, Dari speakers replace Pashto /I/ with /l/ more often than /r/ (Miran, 1969). Dari preserves the Arabic voiceless uvular stop /q/, in contrast to Pashto, which generally employs /k/ in words derived from Arabic spelled with the letter ق (Penzl, 1955). 4 Assessment technique Precision and recall are the most common measures for assessing quality in the context of audio hotspotting (Hu et al., 2012). We employ these metrics in two scenarios: dialect-agnostic and dialect-specific search. In the dialect-agnostic case, one would search for an orthographic term, for example Lashkar Gah, and calculate precision (true positives/(true positives + false positives)) based on how many of the recalled terms were in fact Lashkar Gah, and calculate recall (true positives/(true positives + false negatives)) based on how many of the actual Lashkar Gah’s in the file being searched were identified.

Table 1 illustrates some variation within Dari pronunciation of placenames that we encountered. This variation is not limited to placenames; in fact, each of the phonetic phenomena has been reported by Farhadi (1955), and one variant of each word may be deemed formal and the other colloquial.

In addition, future research will aim to measure the acoustic properties of the two varieties of /ā/. With regard to consonants, Pashto has a retroflex /I/, while Dari does not. In Kunar, the Pashto /I/ corresponds to Dari /r/. Note, however, that when speaking Pashto as a second language, Dari speakers replace Pashto /I/ with /l/ more often than /r/ (Miran, 1969). Dari preserves the Arabic voiceless uvular stop /q/, in contrast to Pashto, which generally employs /k/ in words derived from Arabic spelled with the letter ق (Penzl, 1955). 4 Assessment technique Precision and recall are the most common measures for assessing quality in the context of audio hotspotting (Hu et al., 2012). We employ these metrics in two scenarios: dialect-agnostic and dialect-specific search.

Consider for example, the two common pronunciations of Lashkar Gah in Pashto: [laxkarga] and [laʂkarɡa]. In this case, when calculating precision, if one searches for [laxkarga] and [laʂkarɡa] is retrieved, it is just as wrong as if Kabul were retrieved (variable scoring, by incorporation of approaches such as Nerbonne and Heeringa (2010), will be considered in the future). For calculating recall, the universe of Lashkar Gah’s is limited to those whose pronunciation matches the search term. There is some pronunciation variation that does not necessarily represent dialect variation, and should be considered “under the radar” for the purposes of a dialect-specific search. In the example above, either of the first two vowels could be [ə] instead of [a]. For this reason, we introduce the notion of equivalence classes to enable us to give equal “correct” scores for example to both [laxkarga] and [ləxkarɡa] when searching for [laxka</context>

A system is described where users can find dialect or language-specific pronunciations of Afghan placenames in Dari and Pashto. We explore the efficacy of a phonetic speech recognition system employed in this task. 1 Introduction The Audio Gazetteer hotspotting tool was developed by MITRE (2012) and employs the Nexidia phonetic speech recognition engine (Gavalda and Schlueter, 2010) in several languages, including Dari (the Afghan variety of Persian) and Pashto, the two main languages of Afghanistan. These languages are both members of the Iranian language family and share a number of phonetic characteristics (Miller et al., 2013). This tool enables a user to load audio clips and to search them for words contained within them using one of three methods: the Dari or Pashto alphabets, a Romanization scheme, or phonetics in SAMPA (Wells, 1997).

Most of these methods are designed to emit a judgment as to language, speaker or dialect, based on a given audio sample, which might be useful in various kinds of batch processing. Another approach to accent and nativeness judgment is described by Weinberger and Kunath (2011). In this approach, audio is first reduced to a human-made phonetic transcription that is then mined for clues as to dialect and accent. The work described here may be situated between automatic techniques based on audio and post-hoc techniques focused on transcriptions. Our method is designed for users interacting with a given audio sample; one that is likely to contain a mix of speakers, languages or dialects. Also, in contrast to statistical approaches which may appear as a “black box” to end-users, our approach allows users to iteratively and interactively develop hypotheses as to the asso</context>

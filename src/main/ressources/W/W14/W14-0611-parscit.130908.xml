Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999071">
In this paper, we describe a tool designed to
produce a gold-standard word alignment
between a text and its translation with a novel
visualization. In addition, the tool is designed
to aid the aligners in producing an alignment
at a high level of quality and consistency. This
tool is presently being used to align the
Hebrew Bible with an English translation of it.

1 Introduction and Background
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99986354">
Gold-standard word alignments have been
produced for a variety of purposes, but the
machine translation community has been the most
interested in aligned texts. For this community,
aligning texts is not an end in and of itself. Rather,
gold-standard aligned texts have served to train
and also evaluate machine translation algorithms
or their components, especially automatic
alignment algorithms. However, there are other
scholarly endeavors in which gold-standard word
alignments are useful in and of themselves.
Within linguistics they are certainly helpful to the
subfields of contact linguistics, corpus linguistics,
and historical linguistics, but they are also useful
in humanistic inquiry more broadly, especially in
in studies of translation technique, textual
criticism, philology, and lexicography. In addition,
presenting gold-standard aligned texts can make
texts more accessible to a broader audience,
especially to an audience that has limited skill in
either the source or target language.
A gold-standard alignment that is designed to
aid the humanist is likely to have different
requirements with regard to quality, consistency,
and visualization than a gold-standard alignment
designed as an input to a machine translation
algorithm. Results from research into the effect of
the quality of alignments above a certain level on
machine translation quality has been mixed
(Fraser and Marcu, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008;
Lambert et al., 2012). Thus, the extra cost of
making a good alignment excellent might
outweigh its benefits if its only purpose is to aid
in machine translation. Put differently, a 14 carat
gold-standard alignment may be sufficient for the
purposes of machine translation. However, for the
humanistic endeavors enumerated above,
incremental improvements in quality continue to
be useful to scholars; a 24 carat gold-standard
alignment is highly desirable. Similarly,
consistency is important for many of these
humanistic endeavors. For example, a scholar
researching the way in which a particular word or
class of words is translated needs the alignment to
be done consistently across the translated corpus.
Finally, when the translation and alignment
themselves are an object of study, the alignment
needs to be presented visually in an appealing
manner, and the researcher needs to be able to
access additional information easily.

<bodyText confidence="0.999369272727273">
Achieving a high level of quality and consistency
requires a software tool designed to facilitate this,
and the visualization techniques for this software
tool can be similar to the visualization of the final
alignment. In what follows, we present a manual
alignment tool that has been built as a Java
application for desktop operating systems in order
to achieve these goals for an ongoing project to
align the Hebrew Bible with an English
translation of it. For the Hebrew Bible, we use the
Westminster Leningrad Codex (WLC) and

Westminster Hebrew Morphology (WHM), both
version 4.18. WLC is a diplomatic edition of
Codex Leningradensis, the oldest complete
manuscript of the Hebrew Bible in the Tiberian
tradition. WHM tokenizes the text and provides a
lemma and morphology codes for each token.
WLC and WHM are presently maintained by the J.
Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical
Research. For an English translation, we use the
English Standard Version, 2011 text edition. Its
tokenization is straightforward and was done at
the word level.
While various groups have aligned the Hebrew
Bible with various English translations, beginning
with (Strong, 1890), and even to the Greek
Septuagint translation (Tov, 1986), this project is
unparalleled in its focus on quality and
consistency in the alignment, and the alignment
tool reflects that. The Alignment Panel provides
the primary visualization of the alignment and
allows for its manipulation while several other
panels provide data to aid the aligner with regard
to quality and consistency. The aligners follow a
lengthy document outlining consistency standards.

2.1 Alignment Panel
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999960666666667">
Several types of visualizations have typically been
used to display aligned texts. Most commonly,
lines have been used to show links between
aligned tokens (Melamed, 1998; Daume III;
Smith and Jahr, 2000; Madnani and Hwa, 2004;
Grimes et al., 2010; Hung-Ngo and Winiwarter,
2012). While this is helpful, the lines become
difficult to follow when the word order differs
significantly between the source text and its
translation or even if one text requires
significantly more tokens than the other. The
second common approach uses an alignment
matrix (Tiedemann, 2006; Germann, 2007;
Germann, 2008). Again, this is a helpful
visualization technique, but it takes time for the
user to see which source tokens link to which
target tokens at a glance, and it is easy to
accidentally move over a row or column with
one’s eye. A third approach involves coloring
linked words using distinguishable colors (Merkel,
2003; Ahrenberg et al., 2002; Ahrenberg et al.,
2003). When used by itself, this is helpful but
slow for the eye to find which source token links
to which target token. A fourth approach requires
the user to place the mouse over a particular token
of interest to see links for just that token
(Germann, 2007; Germann, 2008). This removes
the clutter but is cumbersome for a user trying to
see the entirety of the alignment.
The approach taken here, shown in Figure 1,
combines the first and third of these visualization
techniques but modifies them in order to make the
alignment easier to read and to enable the aligner
to align quickly while maintaining high quality. In
addition, the Alignment Panel includes language
helps to speed up the human aligner. Tokens are
displayed vertically. While previous alignment
tools have more conventionally displayed the
tokens horizontally, whether as a flowing text or
as separated tokens, Hebrew is written right-to-
left, while English is written left-to-right, so a
vertical display, as done by (Grimes et al., 2010)
for an Arabic-English alignment, makes more
sense: both languages can be read top to bottom.
The Hebrew tokens are grouped by the human
aligner into token sets, and these token sets form
a partition over all the Hebrew tokens. The same
is true for the English tokens. Hebrew token sets
can then be aligned with English token sets. In
addition, in token sets with two or more tokens,
the human aligner can optionally declare precisely
one token in the token set to have primary status
if it is most basic to the token set on a semantic
level. For example, in Figure 1, the Hebrew word
םיyVi (“wicked”) is linked to an English token set
consisting of two tokens: the and wicked. The
aligner has correctly identified wicked as the
primary token in this English token set. In token
sets containing just one token, the one token
always has primary status.
Alignment visualizations using lines can be
difficult to process if the word order differs
sharply between the source text and its translation.
In order to combat this issue, a key innovation of
this tool is that blank rows are inserted at times on
both the source and target sides. The blank rows
are inserted in such a way that the number of
straight, horizontal lines linking source token sets
to target token sets is maximized. That is, the
maximum possible number of aligned token sets
are aligned horizontally. Subject to this constraint,
blank rows are inserted so as to minimize the sum
of the length of the vertical components of the
lines, including both the lines joining multiple
tokens into a token set and the lines indicating
links between source and target token sets. When
the user changes the alignment, which is done
primarily using drag-and-drop, the tool
immediately recalculates the optimal blank rows
and redraws if necessary, all the while remaining
responsive. While multiple formats are supported
for exporting the alignment data, all of the data is
imported into memory during application startup.
This requires more updating of complex internal

data structures during execution than if an
external database were used, but the approach
taken here supports responsiveness. Deciding
where to put the blank rows is analogous to the
more familiar problem of finding the weighted
minimum edit distance between two strings with
backtrace and thus can be done using the Wagner–
Fischer algorithm, a dynamic programming
algorithm that is O(mn) in both time and memory,
where m and n are the number of source and target
tokens (Wagner and Fischer, 1974). In addition,
the tokens in token sets are connected via lines.
For example, in Figure 1, the English tokens the,
counsel, and of are connected together with lines.
So as to avoid visual clutter, the line linking this
English token set to the Hebrew meets at the
primary token in the token set. If there is no
primary token in the token set, a centrally located
token is chosen instead.
The Alignment Panel uses fifteen different,
easily distinguishable colors that still show up
well on computer monitors for both tokens and
lines to make it immediately clear which tokens
are linked to one another. A few extremely
common function words as well as pronominal
suffixes in the source language always get a
consistent color when they are linked. These are
the tokens that cause Hebrew words often to
contain multiple tokens. For the rest of the tokens,
the colors are selected in such a way so as to avoid
having similar colors near each other and to keep
the colors as stable as possible as the user changes
the alignment. In token sets containing multiple
tokens, primary tokens are bolded.
When aligning modern languages, one might
be able to assume that the aligners are fluent in
both languages. However, when dealing with
ancient languages or ancient dialects with
relatively small corpora, language helps are a
necessity in order to allow the aligner to work
quickly. On the source language side, the Hebrew
lemmas and morphology codes from WHM are
presented to the aligner. The Hebrew lemmas are
presented closest to the center rather than the
surface forms simply because dividing multi-
token Hebrew surface forms would look
orthographically inappropriate and would be
slower for the human aligner to process. For most
languages the surface form should be presented
closest to the center. A literal yet contextual gloss
of the Hebrew token is also presented. These
glosses were produced by Thom Blair using a
separate software tool we wrote; they were
designed for use in (Hebrew-English Interlinear,
2013). The English lemmas to which the Hebrew
lemma has been linked elsewhere are also listed.
To be listed, both the Hebrew lemma and the
English lemma must have primary status. When
there are multiple such English lemmas, they are
listed in order of frequency of being linked. The
target language side mirrors some of the source
language side but is less extensive since we
assume the aligner is fluent in English. The
English lemmas were initially produced using
StanfordCoreNLP (Toutanova et al., 2003, de
Marneffe et al., 2006), with post-processing used
to fix errors. The human aligner can edit them in
case of errors.

2.2 Other panels aiding quality and

Several other panels, shown in Figures 2-4, are
designed to enable the aligner to check the
alignment for quality and consistency.

<bodyText confidence="0.999897807692308">
The Source Detailed Panel gives detailed
information about the alignment for each
occurrence of a lemma in the source text in a
sortable table. In order to aid the aligner, the third
column shows a form of the English gloss that has
been shortened, usually to a single lemma, by
making use of WHM’s morphology information
and Wordlet. The Target Detailed Panel is similar.
The Source Overview Panel briefly presents
information concerning how all source tokens are
aligned in a sortable, filterable table. The glosses
shown are the short forms and are sorted based on
frequency. Similarly, the translations are primary
lemmas only and are sorted according to
frequency. The Target Overview Panel is similar.
The Consistency Panel is oriented toward
enforcing the consistency standards. It uses WHM
as well as information from StanfordCorelLP,
including the syntactic dependency tree, to look
for probable deviations from the project’s
consistency standards. It can fix some errors
automatically if the human aligner allows it, but
the human aligner is not required to follow its
suggestions since it sometimes make mistakes,
especially when the syntactic dependency tree
from StanfordCorelLP contains errors.

3 Conclusions and future work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999922666666667">
The alignment tool is enabling a fast production
of a high-quality, consistent gold-standard
alignment between the Hebrew Bible and an
English translation because of the way it provides
an easy-to-process visualization of the alignment,
provides options for aligners to dig deeper into the
data and check their work, and makes changing
the alignment easy. At present, the alignment tool
is an in-house tool geared toward two specific
texts, but with the exception of the consistency
rules, which will be specific to particular
languages and projects, it could be generalized to
align other texts and languages. At that point, the
generalized alignment tool could be licensed
liberally to researchers.

Results from research into the effect of the quality of alignments above a certain level on machine translation quality has been mixed (Fraser and Marcu, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008; Lambert et al., 2012). Thus, the extra cost of making a good alignment excellent might outweigh its benefits if its only purpose is to aid in machine translation. Put differently, a 14 carat gold-standard alignment may be sufficient for the purposes of machine translation. However, for the humanistic endeavors enumerated above, incremental improvements in quality continue to be useful to scholars; a 24 carat gold-standard alignment is highly desirable.

In addition, the Alignment Panel includes language helps to speed up the human aligner. Tokens are displayed vertically. While previous alignment tools have more conventionally displayed the tokens horizontally, whether as a flowing text or as separated tokens, Hebrew is written right-toleft, while English is written left-to-right, so a vertical display, as done by (Grimes et al., 2010) for an Arabic-English alignment, makes more sense: both languages can be read top to bottom. The Hebrew tokens are grouped by the human aligner into token sets, and these token sets form a partition over all the Hebrew tokens. The same is true for the English tokens. Hebrew token sets can then be aligned with English token sets. In addition, in token sets with two or more tokens, the human aligner can optionally declare precisely one token in the token set to have primary status if it is most basic to the token set on a semantic level. For example, in Figure 1, the Hebrew word םיyVi (“wicked”</context>

Alignment Panel data structures during execution than if an external database were used, but the approach taken here supports responsiveness. Deciding where to put the blank rows is analogous to the more familiar problem of finding the weighted minimum edit distance between two strings with backtrace and thus can be done using the Wagner– Fischer algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm that is O(mn) in both time and memory, where m and n are the number of source and target tokens (Wagner and Fischer, 1974). In addition, the tokens in token sets are connected via lines. For example, in Figure 1, the English tokens the, counsel, and of are connected together with lines. So as to avoid visual clutter, the line linking this English token set to the Hebrew meets at the primary token in the token set. If there is no primary token in the token set, a centrally located token is chosen instead. The Alignment Panel uses fifteen different, easily distinguishable colors that still show up well on computer monitors for both tokens and lines to make it immediately clear which tokens are linked to one another</context>

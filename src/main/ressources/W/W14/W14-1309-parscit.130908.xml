<bodyText confidence="0.99971432">
Social media texts are significant informa-
tion sources for several application areas
including trend analysis, event monitor-
ing, and opinion mining. Unfortunately,
existing solutions for tasks such as named
entity recognition that perform well on
formal texts usually perform poorly when
applied to social media texts. In this pa-
per, we report on experiments that have the
purpose of improving named entity recog-
nition on Turkish tweets, using two dif-
ferent annotated data sets. In these ex-
periments, starting with a baseline named
entity recognition system, we adapt its
recognition rules and resources to better
fit Twitter language by relaxing its capital-
ization constraint and by diacritics-based
expansion of its lexical resources, and we
employ a simplistic normalization scheme
on tweets to observe the effects of these on
the overall named entity recognition per-
formance on Turkish tweets. The evalua-
tion results of the system with these differ-
ent settings are provided with discussions
of these results.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99982214893617">
Analysis of social media texts, particularly mi-
croblog texts like tweets, has attracted recent at-
tention due to significance of the contained in-
formation for diverse application areas like trend
analysis, event monitoring, and opinion mining.
Tools for well-studied problems like named entity
recognition (NER) are usually employed as com-
ponents within these social media analysis appli-
cations. For instance, in (Abel et al., 2011), named
entities extracted from tweets are used to deter-
mine trending topics for user modeling within the
context of personalized recommender systems and
in (Ritter et al., 2012), named entities in tweets
are used to complement the events extracted by an
open domain event extraction system for Twitter.
However, existing NER solutions for well-formed
text types like news articles are reported to suf-
fer from considerable performance degradations
when they are ported to social media texts, mainly
due to the peculiarities of this latter text type (Rit-
ter et al., 2011).
In this paper, we report on our NER experiments
on Turkish tweets in order to determine facilitating
and impeding factors during the development of a
NER system for Turkish tweets which can be used
in social media analysis applications. We carry
out these experiments on two tweet data sets an-
notated with named entities. After the initial eval-
uation results of a rule-based NER system (K¨uc¸¨uk
and Yazıcı, 2009) on these data sets, we gradually
present the performance results achieved by the
extended versions of the system together with dis-
cussions of these results. For these experiments,
we first perform two system adaptations, i.e., re-
laxing the capitalization constraint of the system
and diacritics-based expansion of the system’s lex-
ical resources. Next, we incorporate a simplistic
tweet normalization scheme into the NER proce-
dure. After the evaluation of these extensions, we
provide discussions on the plausible features of a
NER system tailored to Turkish tweets.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
In Section 2, we review the literature on NER on
tweets and NER on Turkish texts. In Section 3, we
present our NER experiments on Turkish tweets.
Directions of future work are outlined in Section 4
and finally Section 5 concludes the paper.

tweets, called T-NER, is presented which employs
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for named en-
tity segmentation and labelled topic modelling for
subsequent classification, using Freebase dictio-
naries. A hybrid approach to NER on tweets is
presented in (Liu et al., 2011) where k-Nearest
Neighbor and CRF based classifiers are sequen-
tially applied. In (Liu et al., 2012), a factor graph
based approach is proposed that jointly performs
NER and named entity normalization on tweets.
An unsupervised approach that performs only
named entity extraction on tweets using resources
like Wikipedia is described in (Li et al., 2012). A
clustering-based approach for NER on microtexts
is presented in (Jung, 2012), a lightweight filter
based approach for NER on tweets is described
in (de Oliveira et al., 2013), and a series of NER
experiments on targeted tweets in Polish is pre-
sented in (Piskorski and Ehrmann, 2013). Finally,
an adaptation of the ANNIE component of GATE
framework to microblog texts, called TwitIE, is
described in (Bontcheva et al., 2013).
Considering NER research on Turkish texts,
various approaches have been employed so far
including those based on using Hidden Markov
Models (HMM) (Tiur et al., 2003), on manually
engineered recognition rules (Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici,
2009; Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2012), on rule learning
(Tatar and C¸icekli, 2011), and on CRFs (Yeniterzi,
2011; S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012). All of these ap-
proaches have been proposed for news texts and
the CRF-based approach (S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012)
is reported to outperform the previous proposals
with a balanced F-Measure of about 91%.
To the best of our knowledge, there are only
two studies on NER from Turkish tweets. In
(C¸elikkaya et al., 2013), the CRF-based NER sys-
tem (S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012) is evaluated on in-
formal text types and is reported to achieve an
F-Measure of 19% on tweets. In (Kiuc¸iuk et al.,
2014), a tweet data set in Turkish annotated with
named entities is presented. The adaptation of a
multilingual rule-based NER system (Pouliquen
and Steinberger, 2009) to Turkish, which achieves
an F-Measure of about 61% on a news article data
set, gets an F-Measure of 37% on this tweet data
set, and after extending the resources of the NER
system with frequently appearing person and orga-
nization names in Turkish news articles, the corre-
sponding scores increase to about 69% and 43%,
respectively (Kiuc¸iuk et al., 2014).

The NER experiments are performed using the
rule-based NER system (Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2009)
which makes use of a set of lexical resources,
i.e., lists of person/location/organization names
(henceforth referred to as PLOs), and patterns for
the extraction of named entities (NEs) of type
PLOs and time/date/money/percent expressions
(Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2009). The system is pro-
posed for news articles which is a considerably
well-formed text type usually with proper capital-
ization of the initial letters of PLOs and separa-
tion of these PLOs from their suffixes with apos-
trophes1. Yet, as even such well-formed texts may
be lacking these important indicators of PLOs, the
system can be configured to make use of the cap-
italization clue or not, and it includes a simplistic
morphological analyzer to check the suffixes at the
end of PLO candidates and thereby validate these
candidates (Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2009).
This NER system achieves a balanced F-
Measure of 78.7% (without giving any credit to
partial extractions) on a news article data set of
about 20K tokens obtained from the METU Turk-
ish corpus (Say et al., 2002) where the annotated
form of this data set includes a total of 1,613 NEs.
Within the course of the current study, we have
evaluated this system on two tweet data sets in
Turkish where statistical information about these
data sets are provided in Table 1. The first one,
which is referred to as Tweet Set−1 in Table 1,
is presented in (Kiuc¸iuk et al., 2014) and comprises
2,320 tweets with about 20K tokens. The sec-
ond data set (Tweet Set−2) includes about 5K

<bodyText confidence="0.999980951219512">
We have first evaluated the system’s performance
on the data sets without any extensions to the exist-
ing NER system. Table 2 presents these evaluation
results using the commonly employed metrics of
precision, recall, and balanced F-Measure, with-
out giving any credit to partially extracted NEs.
Table 3 displays those results with the same met-
rics this time giving credit to partial extractions
with the constraint that the NE type within the sys-
tem output and the answer key must be the same,
where these metrics have been employed in stud-
ies like (Maynard et al., 2001).
The evaluation results in Table 2 and Table
3 are in line with the common finding reported
in the literature that the NER systems for com-
paratively well-formed text types face consider-
able performance decreases when they are eval-
uated on tweets. This observation is usually at-
tributed to the peculiarities of tweet texts such as
common grammatical/spelling errors and deliber-
ate contractions. With strict metrics, the system is
reported to achieve an F-Measure rate of 78.7%.
When it is ported to tweets, the best overall F-
Measure rates achieved are 53.23% and 44.25%
on Tweet Set−1 and Tweet Set−2, respectively,
while the corresponding best F-Measure rates for
only PLOs are 47.76% and 36.63%, respectively,
all with strict metrics. The difference between
the results for PLOs and the overall results also
confirms that the system recognizes temporal and
numerical expressions (within its scope) with de-
cent performance, compared to the recognition of
PLOs.
The F-Measure rates obtained when partial ex-
tractions are also given credit are about 5% higher
than those obtained without giving any credit to
partially extracted NEs. This increase is impor-
tant due to pragmatic reasons as these partially
extracted NEs can help conveniently filter tweet
streams and retrieve relevant subsets of tweets in
several application settings.

Tweet texts possess the following peculiarities
usually as opposed to other formal text types:

<listItem confidence="0.728875555555556">
• Grammatical/spelling errors are common,
like incorrectly writing proper names all in
lowercase letters. A Turkish example illus-
trating a spelling error is the use of geliyoooo
instead of geliyor (meaning is coming).
• Contracted word forms are commonly used
instead of full forms, like referring to the
football club called FenerbahVe as Fener
only, where the latter contracted form is also
homonymous to a common name in Turkish
(meaning lantern).
• For the particular case of Turkish tweets,
non-accentuated characters (c, g, i, o, s, and
u) are often utilized instead of the corre-
sponding Turkish characters with diacritics
(c¸, ˘g, ı, ¨o, s¸, and ¨u). An example of this phe-
nomenon is writing cunku instead of the cor-
rect form, Vunku (meaning because).

3.2.1 Relaxing the Capitalization Constraint

<bodyText confidence="0.999996826086956">
As proper capitalization of PLOs is usually lack-
ing in tweets, we have evaluated the NER sys-
tem with its capitalization feature turned off, so
that the system considers all tokens (no matter
whether their initial character is capitalized or not)
as valid NE candidates. The initial evaluation re-
sults of the system with this setting are provided
in Table 2 and Table 3 within the rows where
the Capitalization column has a corresponding
OFF value. The results for these two capitaliza-
tion settings are also similarly provided in Tables
4-6 which present the evaluation results described
in the upcoming sections.
The results in Table 2 and Table 3 demonstrate
that relaxing the capitalization constraint (i.e., not
using the capitalization clue) during the NER pro-
cedure on Turkish tweets consistently improves
performance for PLOs on both data sets. The im-
provement obtained with this relaxation is more
dramatic on Tweet Set−2 and for this data set
the overall results are accordingly better than those
obtained when the capitalization clue is used. It
should again be noted that the NER system uses a

fixes added at the ends of the NEs, thereby the sys-
tem does not overgenerate with this new setting,
although the precision rates decrease considerably
in return to corresponding increases in the recall
rates. To summarize, together with the fact that
about 25.1% of all PLOs within Tweet Set−1 are
lacking proper capitalization (K¨uc¸¨uk et al., 2014),
these findings suggest that the ability to relax this
capitalization constraint is a convenient feature of
a practical NER system for Turkish tweets. An
alternative feature would be to automatically cor-
rect the capitalization of NEs instead, as a pre-
processing step.

3.2.2 Diacritics-Based Expansion of the
Lexical Resources
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983454545455">
In Turkish tweet texts, words including Turkish
characters with diacritics are often, usually ei-
ther erroneously or deliberately for pragmatic rea-
sons such as to type faster, spelled with their non-
diacritic equivalents, as pointed out above. There-
fore, we expand the entries in the lexical resources
of the NER system to include both diacritic and
non-diacritic variants of these entries. For in-
stance, the Turkish name of the island Cyprus,
Kibris, may appear in tweets as Kibris, Kibris,
or Kibris, as well. As this example denotes, for
each existing entry with n such Turkish-specific
characters, 2n entries (including the original en-
try) are included in the ultimate expanded forms
of the lexical resources, since each such character
may be used as it is or may be replaced with its
equivalent.
During this expansion stage, we have applied
a filtering procedure over these newly considered
2n − 1 entries to check whether they are homony-
mous to common names in Turkish. This fil-
tering procedure basically checks whether an ex-
pansion candidate is within a list of unique, sup-
posedly well-formed, Turkish words comprising
about 1,140,208 items including inflected forms
(Zemberek, 2010), and if it is, then this candidate
is discarded to avoid overgeneration during the ac-
tual NER procedure.
We have tested this new version of the sys-
tem with expanded lexical resources and the corre-
sponding evaluation results are provided in Table
4 and Table 5, using the strict and partial evalua-
tion metrics, respectively. Both strict and partial
evaluation results denote that the performance of
the system is improved after this diacritics-based
expansion of the system resources. The best re-
sults are obtained when this expansion is com-
bined with the relaxation of the capitalization con-
straint, for PLOs on Tweet Set−1, and both for
PLOs and all 7 NE types on Tweet Set−2. Sim-
ilar to the points made in the previous section,
this diacritics-based expansion scheme stands as
a promising feature of an ultimate NER system
for Turkish tweets, also considering the fact that

about 6.3% of all NEs in Tweet Set−1 are writ-
ten in characters with missing diacritics. A plausi-
ble alternative to this feature would be to perform
diacritics-based correction (or, normalization) as
presented in studies like (Mihalcea, 2002) prior to
the actual NER procedure. Similar approaches can
be tested on tweets in other languages having com-
mon characters with diacritics.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.995967">
3.3 Tweet Normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99247002">
Tweet normalization has emerged as an important
research problem (Han and Baldwin, 2011), the
solutions to which can readily be used in systems
for sentiment analysis and NER (as considered in
studies such as (Liu et al., 2012)), among others.
In order to observe the effects of normalization
on NER performance on Turkish tweets, we have
first experimented with a simplistic tweet normal-
ization scheme which aims at decreasing repeated
characters in words, as repetition of characters in
tweets is a frequent means to express stress. The
scheme is outlined below:
1. In order to determine the list of valid Turk-
ish words with consecutively repeated char-
acters, we have employed the list of Turk-
ish unique words (Zemberek, 2010), that we
have previously utilized during the diacritics-
based resource expansion procedure in Sec-
tion 3.2.2. Within this list, 74,262 words
(about 6.5% of the list) turn out to have con-
secutively repeated characters.
2. Using this sublist as a reference resource, we
have implemented the actual simplistic nor-
malization scheme: if a word in a tweet has
consecutively repeated character sequences
and the word is not included within the afore-
mentioned sublist, then all of these character
sequences are contracted to single character
instances. For instance, with this procedure,
the token zamaanlaaa is correctly replaced
with zamanla (meaning with time) and
mirayyy is correctly replaced with miray (a
proper person name).
The employment of the above normalization
scheme prior to the actual NER procedure has
led to slightly poorer results as some NEs which
should not be normalized through this scheme are
normalized instead. For instance, the city name
C¸anakkale is changed to C¸anakale during the
normalization procedure and it is missed by the
subsequent NER procedure. Hence, we employ
a three-phase pipelined NER approach where we
first run the NER procedure on the input text, then
employ the normalization scheme on the NER out-
put, and finally run the NER procedure again on
the normalization output, in order to avoid that the
normalization step corrupts well-formed NEs that
can readily be extracted by the system.
The performance of this ultimate NER pipeline,
with the capitalization feature turned off during

both of the actual NER phases, is evaluated only
on Tweet Set−1. Therefore, the performance
evaluations of the first NER phase correspond to
the previously presented results in the rows 4-6 of
Table 2 and Table 3, with strict and partial versions
of the metrics, respectively.
Below we summarize our findings regarding the
intermediate normalization procedure employed,
based on its evaluation results. Although some of
these findings are not directly relevant for the pur-
poses of the NER procedure, we provide them for
the completeness of the discussion on the normal-
ization of Turkish tweets.

• Excluding the normalization cases which in-
volve non-alphabetical characters only (like
normalizing &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to &gt;), those that result
in a normalized form with a single alphabet-
ical character (like normalizing oooooo to
o), and those that involve emotion expres-
sions (like normalizing :DDDDD to :D), the
number of resulting instances considered for
performance evaluation is 494.
• The number of normalization instances in
which an incorrect token is precisely con-
verted into its corresponding valid form is
253, so, the precision of the overall normal-
ization scheme is 51.21%.
• 117 of the incorrect cases are due to the fact
that the token that is considered for normal-
ization is a valid but foreign token (such as
normalizing Harry to Hary, jennifer to
jenifer, full to ful, and tweet to twet).
Hence, these cases account for a decrease of
23.68% in the precision of the normalization
scheme.
• 15 of the incorrect instances are due to the
fact that Turkish characters with diacritics
are not correctly used, hence they cannot be

found within the reference sublist of valid
Turkish words, and subsequently considered
by the normalization procedure, although
they could instead be subject to a diacritics-
based normalization, as pointed out at the end
of Section 3.2.2. For instance, s¸iir (mean-
ing poem) is incorrectly written as siir in
a tweet and since it, in this incorrect form,
cannot be found on the reference sublist, it is
erroneously changed to sir. There are also
other incorrect instances in which superflu-
ous characters are correctly removed with the
normalization procedure, yet the resulting to-
ken is still not in its correct form as a subse-
quent diacritics-based correction is required.
Though they are not considerably frequent
(as we only consider here tokens with consec-
utively repeated characters), these instances
serve to confirm that the restoration of dia-
critics should be considered along with other
forms of normalization.
• Some other frequent errors made by the nor-
malization scheme are due to incorrect to-
kenization as whitespaces to separate to-
kens can be missing due to writing errors or
the tendency to write some phrases hashtag-
like. An example case is incorrectly writ-
ing the adverb, demek ki (meaning so or
that means), as demekki in a tweet, which
in turn is erroneously changed to demeki
during normalization. This token, demekki,
should not be considered within this type of
normalization at all, although it needs pro-
cessing to be transformed into its correct
form, demek ki.
To summarize, the normalization scheme can
be enhanced considering the above points, where
proper treatment of non-Turkish tokens and the
consideration of diacritics-based issues stand as
the most promising directions of improvement.
Other more elaborate ways of normalizing tweets,
as presented in studies such as (Han and Bald-
win, 2011), should also be tested together with
the NER procedure, to observe their ultimate con-
tribution. Along the way, a normalization dictio-
nary for Turkish can be compiled, following stud-
ies like (Han et al., 2012).
The evaluation results of the ultimate three-
phase NER pipeline are provided in Table 6, with
the systems’s capitalization feature turned off in
both NER phases. Within the first three rows, the
results with the strict evaluation metrics are dis-
played while the last three rows present those re-
sults obtained with the partial versions. When we
examine the individual NER results after the in-
corporation of normalization scheme in details, we
observe that there are cases where incorrectly nor-
malizing some common names or slang/contracted
words leads to them being extracted as NEs during
the second NER phase. In order to prevent such

false positives, the ways of improving the normal-
ization procedure discussed above can be imple-
mented and thereby less errors will be propagated
into the second NER phase.
Though the overall results in Table 6 are slightly
better than their counterparts when normalization
is not employed, we cannot derive sound conclu-
sions about the contribution of this normalization
scheme to the overall NER procedure. The slight
improvement is also an expected result as the size
of the test data set is quite small and the number
of NEs to be recognized after this type of nor-
malization is already limited since only about 1%
of all PLOs in Tweet Set−1 have incorrectly re-
peated consecutive characters. Yet, the results are
still promising in that with a more elaborate nor-
malization procedure evaluated on larger corpora,
more dramatic increases in the NER performance
can be obtained on Turkish tweets.

4 Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992906363636364">
Directions of future work based on the current
study include the following:
• Following the points made throughout Sec-
tion 3, several normalization schemes also in-
volving case and diacritics restoration can be
implemented and incorporated into the NER
procedure on tweets.
• Since tweet texts are short and informal, they
often lack contextual clues needed to perform
an efficient NER procedure. Additionally,
there is a tendency to mention new and pop-
ular NEs in tweets which might be missed by
a NER system with static lexical resources.
Hence, extending the lexical resources of
the NER system with contemporary up-to-
date NEs automatically obtained from Turk-
ish news articles can be considered. For this
purpose, we can readily employ resources
like JRC-Names (Steinberger et al., 2011), a
publicly available continuously-updated NE
and name variant dictionary, as a source of
up-to-date NEs in Turkish.

5 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999983888888889">
In this study, we target the problem of named en-
tity recognition on Turkish tweets. We have car-
ried out experiments starting with a rule-based
recognition system and gradually extended it in
two directions: adapting the rules/resources of
the system and introducing a tweet normalization
scheme into the recognition procedure. Thereby,
we present our findings on named entity recogni-
tion on Turkish tweets in addition to those on the
normalization of Turkish tweets. Based on these
findings, we outline some desirable features of a
named entity recognition system tailored to Turk-
ish tweets. Future work includes the employment
and testing of more elaborate tweet normalization
procedures along the way, on larger tweet data
sets, in addition to evaluating the system after its
resources are automatically extended with dictio-
naries of up-to-date named entities.

Unfortunately, existing solutions for tasks such as named entity recognition that perform well on formal texts usually perform poorly when applied to social media texts. In this paper, we report on experiments that have the purpose of improving named entity recognition on Turkish tweets, using two different annotated data sets. In these experiments, starting with a baseline named entity recognition system, we adapt its recognition rules and resources to better fit Twitter language by relaxing its capitalization constraint and by diacritics-based expansion of its lexical resources, and we employ a simplistic normalization scheme on tweets to observe the effects of these on the overall named entity recognition performance on Turkish tweets.

The evaluation results of the system with these different settings are provided with discussions of these results. 1 Introduction Analysis of social media texts, particularly microblog texts like tweets, has attracted recent attention due to significance of the contained information for diverse application areas like trend analysis, event monitoring, and opinion mining. Tools for well-studied problems like named entity recognition (NER) are usually employed as components within these social media analysis applications. For instance, in (Abel et al., 2011), named entities extracted from tweets are used to determine trending topics for user modeling within the context of personalized recommender systems and in (Ritter et al., 2012), named entities in tweets are used to complement the events extracted by an open domain event extraction system for Twitter. However, existing NER solutions for well-formed text types like news articles are reported to suffer from considerable performance degradations when they are ported to social media texts, mainly due to the peculiarities of this latter text type (Ritter et al., 2011).

Finally, an adaptation of the ANNIE component of GATE framework to microblog texts, called TwitIE, is described in (Bontcheva et al., 2013). Considering NER research on Turkish texts, various approaches have been employed so far including those based on using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) (Tiur et al., 2003), on manually engineered recognition rules (Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2009; Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2012), on rule learning (Tatar and C¸icekli, 2011), and on CRFs (Yeniterzi, 2011; S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012). All of these approaches have been proposed for news texts and the CRF-based approach (S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012) is reported to outperform the previous proposals with a balanced F-Measure of about 91%.

Similar approaches can be tested on tweets in other languages having common characters with diacritics. 3.3 Tweet Normalization Tweet normalization has emerged as an important research problem (Han and Baldwin, 2011), the solutions to which can readily be used in systems for sentiment analysis and NER (as considered in studies such as (Liu et al., 2012)), among others. In order to observe the effects of normalization on NER performance on Turkish tweets, we have first experimented with a simplistic tweet normalization scheme which aims at decreasing repeated characters in words, as repetition of characters in tweets is a frequent means to express stress. The scheme is outlined below: 1. In order to determine the list of valid Turkish words with consecutively repeated characters, we have employed the list </context>

This token, demekki, should not be considered within this type of normalization at all, although it needs processing to be transformed into its correct form, demek ki.

Other more elaborate ways of normalizing tweets, as presented in studies such as (Han and Baldwin, 2011), should also be tested together with the NER procedure, to observe their ultimate contribution.

The scheme is outlined below: 1.

Table 2 presents these evaluation results using the commonly employed metrics of precision, recall, and balanced F-Measure, without giving any credit to partially extracted NEs. Table 3 displays those results with the same metrics this time giving credit to partial extractions with the constraint that the NE type within the system output and the answer key must be the same, where these metrics have been employed in studies like (Maynard et al., 2001). The evaluation results in Table 2 and Table 3 are in line with the common finding reported in the literature that the NER systems for comparatively well-formed text types face considerable performance decreases when they are evaluated on tweets. This observation is usually attributed to the peculiarities of tweet texts such as common grammatical/spelling errors and deliberate contractions. With strict metrics, the system is reported to achieve an F-Measure rate of 78.7%. When it is ported to tweets, the best overall FMeasure rates achieved are 53.23% and 44.25% on Tweet Set−1 and Tweet Set−2</context>

In (C¸elikkaya et al., 2013), the CRF-based NER system (S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012) is evaluated on informal text types and is reported to achieve an F-Measure of 19% on tweets.

The adaptation of a multilingual rule-based NER system (Pouliquen and Steinberger, 2009) to Turkish, which achieves an F-Measure of about 61% on a news article data set, gets an F-Measure of 37% on this tweet data set, and after extending the resources of the NER system with frequently appearing person and organization names in Turkish news articles, the corresponding scores increase to about 69% and 43%, respectively (Kiuc¸iuk et al., 2014).

Considering NER research on Turkish texts, various approaches have been employed so far including those based on using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) (Tiur et al., 2003), on manually engineered recognition rules (Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2009; Kiuc¸iuk and Yazici, 2012), on rule learning (Tatar and C¸icekli, 2011), and on CRFs (Yeniterzi, 2011; S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012). All of these approaches have been proposed for news texts and the CRF-based approach (S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012) is reported to outperform the previous proposals with a balanced F-Measure of about 91%. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two studies on NER from Turkish tweets. In (C¸elikkaya et al., 2013), the CRF-based NER system (S¸eker and Eryi˘git, 2012) is evaluated on informal text types and is reported to achieve an F-Measure of 19% on tweets. In (Kiuc¸iuk et al., 2014), a tweet data set in Turkish annotated with named entities is presented. The ad</context>

During this expansion stage, we have applied a filtering procedure over these newly considered 2n − 1 entries to check whether they are homonymous to common names in Turkish. This filtering procedure basically checks whether an expansion candidate is within a list of unique, supposedly well-formed, Turkish words comprising about 1,140,208 items including inflected forms (Zemberek, 2010), and if it is, then this candidate is discarded to avoid overgeneration during the actual NER procedure. We have tested this new version of the system with expanded lexical resources and the corresponding evaluation results are provided in Table 4 and Table 5, using the strict and partial evaluation metrics, respectively. Both strict and partial evaluation results denote that the performance of the system is improved after this diacritics-based expansion of the system resources. The best results are obtained when this expansion is combined with the relaxation of the capitalization constraint,</context>

In order to observe the effects of normalization on NER performance on Turkish tweets, we have first experimented with a simplistic tweet normalization scheme which aims at decreasing repeated characters in words, as repetition of characters in tweets is a frequent means to express stress. The scheme is outlined below: 1. In order to determine the list of valid Turkish words with consecutively repeated characters, we have employed the list of Turkish unique words (Zemberek, 2010), that we have previously utilized during the diacriticsbased resource expansion procedure in Section 3.2.2. Within this list, 74,262 words (about 6.5% of the list) turn out to have consecutively repeated characters. 2. Using this sublist as a reference resource, we have implemented the actual simplistic normalization scheme: if a word in a tweet has consecutively repeated character sequences and the word is not included within the aforementioned sublist, then all of these character sequences are contracted to single character instances. For instance, with this procedure, the token zamaanlaaa </context>

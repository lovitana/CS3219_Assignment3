<bodyText confidence="0.999374846153846">
In this paper we outline our work to build
Somali language Corpora. A read-speech
corpus named Asaas and containing
about 10 hours and 26 minutes of good
quality signal fully transcribed and well
corrected with a well-balanced phonetic
distribution is presented. Secondly we
outline a Web-based Somali textual cor-
pus named Wargeys and containing about
3 million of words and more than
120 000 different words. This corpus is
formatted and the spelling fluctuation is
standardized.

1 Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.99970772">
Transcribed speech corpora and huge text corpo-
ra are the core of systems used to construct
acoustic and language models (Jelinek, F. 1976).
Constructing of large transcribed corpora is time
consuming and expensive, even if some re-
searchers (Hughes et al, 2010; Badenhorst et al,
2009; Schlippe et al, 2012; De Pauw et al, 2009)
are working on how to create automatically and
quickly speech corpora by using different sys-
tems including phone applications.
If large transcribed speech corpora, more than
100 hours, exist for European languages like
English, French or Spanish, the situation is quite
different for African languages. About 2000 lan-
guages are spoken in Africa. Large part of them
is not yet written and is today threatened of dis-
appearing. Building speech Corpora and speech
processing tools are crucial for each African lan-
guage.
In this paper we present in section 2 the Soma-
li language. Section 3 will focus on the first So-
mali read-speech corpus called Asaas (Beginning
in Somali) and also the first Web-Based Somali
Language Model and text Corpus called Wargeys
(Newspaper in Somali) in Section 4.

2 Somali language
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999949633333333">
Four languages are spoken in Djibouti. French
and Arabic are official languages, Somali and
Afar are native and widely spoken. Somali and
Afar are Cushitic languages within the Afro- asi-
atic family. Somali language is spoken in several
countries in East of Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia,
Somalia and Kenya) by a population estimated
between 11 to 13 million of inhabitants. The dif-
ferent variants are Somali-somali, Somali-maay,
Somali-dabarre, Somali-garre, Somali-jiiddu and
Somali-tunni. Somali-somali and Somali-maay
are the most widely spread variants (80% and
17%). We only process the Somali-somali vari-
ant, commonly known as Somali language and
spoken in Djibouti. The phonetic structure of this
language has 22 consonants and 5 basic vowels
which all occur in front and back versions
(+ATR or -ATR). These 10 vowels occur in long
and short pairs, giving 20 in total (Saeed, J.
1999). There are also 5 diphthongs which occur
in front and back, long and short versions. Soma-
li is also a tone accent language with 2 to 3 lexi-
cal tones (Hyman, L. 2010; Saeed, J. 1987; Gac,
D. 2002). The written system was adopted in
1972, and there are no textual archives before
this date. It uses Roman letters and doesn’t con-
sider the tonal accent in the current form. Somali
words are composed by the concatenation of syl-
lable structures (Bendjaballah, S. 1998. Saeed, J.
1999).

French and Arabic languages are official
languages in Djibouti. The transcription of
Somali language in Roman letters facilitates its
reading. But it is difficult to find persons who
can read it fluently. Fifteen Somali-speaking men
living in Djibouti and without any problem of
pronunciation were preselected. At last 10 people
were selected for recordings according to their
reading fluency. Table 2 shows information on
their social class, their study level and their age.
All recorders were volunteers.

microphone with a sampling frequency of 16

3.4 Corpus characteristics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989644363636364">
The duration of the Somali read-speech corpus is
10 hours and 26 minutes. We named it Asaas,
which means &amp;quot;beginning&amp;quot; in the Somali
language. Its phonetic distribution is given in
Figure 1. We can consider that this distribution is
well-balanced because it is quite similar to the
one of the huge amount of the Somali text corpus
(3 million of words). The phoneme /a/ occurs
approximately 20 % of all the phonemes. The
glottal phoneme /’/ ( ʔ in IPA) represents about
0,2%.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.99868">
Figure 1: Phonetic distribution of Asaas Corpus
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999273333333333">
The duration of phonemes varies according to
the speakers. However, in general, long vowels
and fricatives are the longest ones. The short
vowels and plosives have smaller duration. The
phoneme which has the longest duration is /sh/ (∫
in IPA). The average duration of all phonemes is
given in Figure 2. Plosives phonemes are split
into two parts: the burst (Btt for the /t/ phoneme,
Bkk for the /k/ one and the occlusion Ott for the
/t/ one and Okk for the /k/).
The average rate of the speech is 1.93 words per
second.
</bodyText>
<figureCaption confidence="0.995224">
Figure 2: average duration of phonemes
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998994">
There is a real difference between the duration of
short and long vowels. Thus, long /a/ (written aa
is Somali) is 2 times longer than the short /a/
(written a in Somali) and the /uu/ is 1.75 times
longer than the /u/. On average, the ratio of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.993546">
74
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996907888888889">
duration between long and short vowels is 1.86.
A comparison of the duration of long and short
vowels is given in Figure 3. This feature can be
used in acoustic modeling by creating two
separate models for each vowel (long and short).
It is also possible to recognize them with the
language model. But both language model and
separate acoustic models will probably improve
the Word Error Rate.

4 Somali Text Corpus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999962378378378">
Corpus containing millions of words or even
billions of words is usually used for language
modeling. If these data are mostly available for
English and French languages, it is quite
different for newly written languages like
African languages. The lack of textual data
constitutes a real handicap.
Grefenstette (2002) shows that African
languages are gaining ground on the Web, even
if European languages are largely dominant.
Despite this growth their presence on the web is
insufficient. This growth is relative, because in
large part due to South African websites.
Shigeaki (2008) clearly shows the prominence of
South African sites on the continent.
Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) propose a
formula to estimate the number of words found
on the Internet for a given language. For this, we
divide the number of times a word has been
found by a search engine in cyberspace by the
relative frequency of the word in that language.
The average result on a predefined list of words
provides an estimation of the number of words
on the web. Estimation calculated in March 2014
for the Somali language gives about 500 million
Somali words on the Web. The frequency of
Somali words used was calculated on the textual
corpus WARGEYS.
Many researchers are involved on how to create
automatically textual corpora from the Internet
for under-resourced languages (Ghani et al,
2001. Vaufreydaz et al, 1999). For our purposes
we selected and downloaded a set of Somali
newspapers on the Internet. As the audio corpus,
the selection criteria were the variant of the
language, the diversity of topics and the number
of errors.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.994919">
4.1 Formatting
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999768">
The text downloaded is not directly usable. After
removal of HTML tags, we proceeded to some
transformations dealing with abbreviations, dates
and times, numbers, proper names, foreign words
and punctuation.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998847">
4.2 Spelling normalization
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999956678571428">
The Somali language as most of African
languages is written after the independence
period (1960-1970). So the orthography is not
yet stabilized. The same word can be written in
different ways according to people. Calvet, L.
(1987) shows that the word eight in Mandingo is
written segin in Mali, seyin in Guinea and seegin
in Burkina Faso. In Somali Language the word
President appears like madaxweyne or
madaxwayne. This lack of standardization is
common for most of the African languages and
disrupts the language models quality as well as
the Automatic Speech Recognition systems
accuracy.
To resolve this problem, for a given simple
word like madaxweyne we considered that the
most frequent spelling is the good one. If
madaxweyne appears 17 times in the corpus and
madaxwayne 9 times, Madaxweyne is selected
and all the madaxwayne were changed to
madaxweyne.
For the component words like iskumid and
isku mid, we choice the separate orthography like
isku mid. This choice is made to separate
syllable because if iskumid (Perhaps Out of
Vocabulary Word) is not recognized by a ASR
system, isku can be recognized or mid can be
recognized.

Somali web-based textual corpus was named
WARGEYS (Newspaper in Somali) because this

Constructing of large transcribed corpora is time consuming and expensive, even if some researchers (Hughes et al, 2010; Badenhorst et al, 2009; Schlippe et al, 2012; De Pauw et al, 2009) are working on how to create automatically and quickly speech corpora by using different systems including phone applications. If large transcribed speech corpora, more than 100 hours, exist for European languages like English, French or Spanish, the situation is quite different for African languages. About 2000 languages are spoken in Africa. Large part of them is not yet written and is today threatened of disappearing.

Secondly we outline a Web-based Somali textual corpus named Wargeys and containing about 3 million of words and more than 120 000 different words. This corpus is formatted and the spelling fluctuation is standardized. 1 Introduction Transcribed speech corpora and huge text corpora are the core of systems used to construct acoustic and language models (Jelinek, F. 1976). Constructing of large transcribed corpora is time consuming and expensive, even if some researchers (Hughes et al, 2010; Badenhorst et al, 2009; Schlippe et al, 2012; De Pauw et al, 2009) are working on how to create automatically and quickly speech corpora by using different systems including phone applications. If large transcribed speech corpora, more than 100 hours, exist for European languages like English, French or Spanish, the situation is quite different for African languages. About 2000 languages are spoken in Africa. Large part of them is not yet written and is today threatened of disappearing. Building speech Corpora and speech processing tools are crucial for each African language. In this paper we present in section 2 the Somali language. Se</context>

For this, we divide the number of times a word has been found by a search engine in cyberspace by the relative frequency of the word in that language. The average result on a predefined list of words provides an estimation of the number of words on the web. Estimation calculated in March 2014 for the Somali language gives about 500 million Somali words on the Web. The frequency of Somali words used was calculated on the textual corpus WARGEYS. Many researchers are involved on how to create automatically textual corpora from the Internet for under-resourced languages (Ghani et al, 2001. Vaufreydaz et al, 1999). For our purposes we selected and downloaded a set of Somali newspapers on the Internet. As the audio corpus, the selection criteria were the variant of the language, the diversity of topics and the number of errors. 4.1 Formatting The text downloaded is not directly usable. After removal of HTML tags, we proceeded to some transformations dealing with abbreviations, dates and times, numbers, proper names, foreign words and punctuation. 4.2 Spelling normalization The Somali language as most of African languages is written after the independence period (1960-1970).

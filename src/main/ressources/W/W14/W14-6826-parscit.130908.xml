<bodyText confidence="0.998754894736842">
Chinese spelling check (CSC) is an essential
issue in the research field of Chinese
language processing (CLP). This paper
describes the details of two CSC systems we
developed to solve this problem. The first
system was built based on CRF model, and
the modules of such system include word
segmentation, error detection and error
correction. Another system was based on 2-
Chars&amp;&amp;3-Chars model, and its modules
include bigram segmentation, error detection
and error correction. Using the final test data
set provided by CLP2014, the final
experimental result of the system based on 2-
Chars&amp;&amp;3-Chars model was better, which
achieved 0.403 detection accuracy with
0.3344 detection precision and 0.3964
correction accuracy with 0.3191 correction
precision.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999547016393443">
Language Spelling check is an important subject
in the field of language processing both in
Chinese and English. Compared with English,
how to detect and correct spelling errors in
Chinese sentences automatically is more difficult.
In English, there are two classes of spelling
errors: non-word spelling errors and real-word
spelling errors. Non-word spelling errors
generally refer to the wrong spelling words that
not exist in a dictionary, such as a sentence ‘buu
some apples’ where ‘buu’ is an error word which
can’t be found in a dictionary. Real-word
spelling errors usually refer to the wrong words
which are misused in sentences but exist in a
dictionary, for example, in the sentence ‘bye
some apples’, ‘bye’ is misused in such sentence
but can be found in a dictionary.
Chinese spelling check is different. Firstly, for
Chinese electronic documents, there are not non-
word spelling errors, because each misspelled
character is exist in reality, such as “&amp;*03�(
chan ling fu nv”, “ * ( Pz ) ling” is a character
misused but exists in reality. Secondly, in
English sentences, each word is separated by a
space, so it’s easier to detect misspelled words.
But there are no word delimiters between words
in Chinese sentences, and a Chinese word may
consist of a single-character or more, so it’s hard
to decide whether a single-character is wrong or
it’s a part of a misspelled word.
Generally, phonologically similar or visually
similar characters result in the misspelled words
in Chinese sentences. For instance, “WAW,
ying er ge shu”, “I&amp; shu” is misspelled as “,
shu” because both are pronounced as “shu”. In
the sentence “TWHM bu duan ceng jia”, “t@
zeng” is misspelled as “H g&amp;quot; &amp;quot;a15
�, cen because �, is
similar with “ M ” in visual. For most CSC
systems, to correct the misspelled words, it’s
necessary to build a module to replace the wrong
characters by similar characters extracted from
the character confusion sets which are edited
based on phonologically and visually similarity
between characters. In our experiment, the
confusion sets provided by SIGHAN Bake-off
2013 are used in both CSC systems (Wu et al.,
2013).
Lots of colleges and research institutions have
made efforts to solve such CSC problems in
recent years. There have been two types of
methods of spelling check: rule-based methods
and statistical methods. Data driven, the
statistical spelling check approaches appear to be
more robust and performs better than simple
rule-based methods (Chiu et al., 2013). Wang et
al. (2013) built a system and its main idea is to
exchange potential error character with its
confusable ones and rescore the modified
sentence using a conditional random field (CRF)-
based word segmentation/part of speech (POS)

tagger and a tri-gram language model (LM) to
detect and correct possible spelling errors. Lin
and Chu (2013) also proposed a system and the
modules in their system include word
segmentation, N-gram model probability
estimation, similar character replacement, and
filtering rules. In this paper, we build two CSC
systems based on CRF model and 2-Chars&amp;&amp;3-
Chars model. The rest of this paper will
introduce the two CSC systems in detail, and it’s
organized as follows. We will introduce the first
system based on CRF model in section 2, in
section 3 we’ll describe the second system based
on 2-Chars&amp;&amp;3-Chars model, at last we’ll make
conclusions in section 4.

As is shown in Figure 1, our system gets the
input sentences firstly, then the sentences will be
segmented by word which is based on CRF
model, after the step of word segmentation, error
words in the sentences segmented will be picked
out by some rules and be dealed with the module
of error correction. Details of the models will be
discussed in the following subsections.

2.1 Word Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999940111111111">
Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is the first
step for Chinese language processing. In recent
years, Chinese spelling checkers have
incorporated word segmentation (Chiu et al.,
2013) and many word segmentation methods
have been proposed. Such as support vector
machine (SVM), conditional random field (CRF)
and maximum entropy Markov models
(MEMMs), among them, CRF-based approach
has been shown to be effective with very low
computational complexity (Wang et al., 2013).
The module word segmentation of our first
CSC system uses condition random fields (CRF)
approach. CRFs are a class of undirected
graphical models with exponent distribution
(Lafferty et al., 2001). A common used special
case of CRFs is linear chain, which has a
distribution of:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.972820333333333">
_ _T _
P (y  |x) =Z exp(E E Ak A, (yt-1, yt , x, t))
x
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.965058571428571">
where fk (yt-1 , yt , x, t) is a function which
is usually an indicator function; Ak is the learned
weight of feature fk ; and Z is the
x
normalization factor. The feature function
actually consists of two kinds of features, that is,
the feature of single state and the feature of
transferring between states.
In this system, we use a public tool CRF++ (Li
et al., 2009) for CRF implementation and regard
the PKU (Emerson, 2005) corpus as the training
corpus.
The process of word segmentation using
CRF++ is as follows:

<listItem confidence="0.8706868">

the PKU training corpus to traditional Chinese;

system.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.974878">
2.2 Error Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999994357142857">
If there’re no misspelled words in a sentence, the
sentence could be divided into serial correct
words after ideal word segmentation. But if a
sentence contains misspelled words, the
segmentation could separate words containing
misspelled character by serial single characters
(Chang et al., 2013). For instance, the sentence
“儘管婦女的數量不斷增加 jin guan fu nv de
shu liang bu duan zeng jia” which has no
misspelled words will be segmented into “儘管/
婦 女 / 的 / 數 量 / 不 斷 / 增 加 ”. However, the
sentence “儘管婦女的數量不斷正加 jin guan
fu nv de shu liang bu duan zheng jia” with an
error word “正加” (“增 zeng” is misspelled as

<bodyText confidence="0.9988295">
“正 zheng”) will be segmented into “儘管/婦女
/的/數量/不斷/正/加”. In this sentence “正加”
is an error word, so it is segmented into serial
two single characters “正” and “加”.
In the error detection module of our first CSC
system , we make a rule that error occurs in the
serial single characters generated by word
segmentation. Like the serial characters “正” and
“加”, one of these serial characters should be an
error.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987086">
2.3 Error Correction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991634928571428">
In this system, we build a 2-Chars dictionary
extracted from a large number of lexicons and a
web training corpus which is collected from lots
of news reports, compositions and other data on
the web.
The way to build a 2-Chars dictionary is as
follows:
a. Segment the sentences in web training
corpus by bigram. For example, “邁向充滿希望
的新世紀 mai xiang chong man xi wang de xin
shi ji” will be segmented as “邁向/向充/充滿/滿
希/希望/望的/的新/新世/世紀”;
b. Count the frequency (indicates how many
times a word presents in the web training corpus)
of each word;
c. Add each word and its frequency into the 2-
Chars dictionary.
The format of words in the 2-Chars dictionary
is [Word:Frequency]. For example:
邁向:23 向充:3 充滿:75 滿希:7
希望:322 望的:16 的新:195 新世:25
世紀:230 ...
In our system, we just deal with the error
words consist of two characters. We take the
serial single characters “ 正 ” and “ 加 ” for
example. Firstly, “ 正 ” will be replaced by its
similar character lists one by one, then the
similar character will be combined with “加” to a
new word “?加”. If the new word “?加” do exist
in the 2-Chars dictionary, the similar character
will be added into the candidates list. After the
treatment of all similar characters of “正”, “加”
will be replaced by its similar character lists like
the processing of “正”. At last, if the length of
candidates list is more than one, we will choose
the new word with the highest frequency in the
2-Chars dictionary.
Table 1 and table 2 show the processing of
“正” and “加”, from these two table, we can find
that the frequency of new word “增加” consist of
“增” and “加” is higher than “正下” and “正夾”,
so “增” should be the correct character of “正”.

We submitted two experimental results using
two different number of lexicons. As shown in
table 3 and table 4, the final results of the first
CSC system are not so good.
The defect of word segmentation and the limit
of 2-Chars dictionary may result in the bad result.
Besides the future work of improving the
performance of this CSC system, we propose
another CSC system without word segmentation
in section 3.

Although the first module of most Chinese
spelling checkers are word segmentation, there
still exist many problems which may have bad
influences on the next modules of the spelling
checkers. Such as “但是 嬰兒出生率不正加反
而減少 dan shi ying er chu sheng lv bu zheng jia
fan er jian shao” (“增 zeng” is misspelled as “正
zheng”), the result of word segmentation is “但
是/嬰兒/出生率/不正/加/反而/減少” where “不
正 ” is regarded as a word which results in the
neglect of wrong word “正加”.

2-Chars&amp;&amp;3-Chars model
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999688909090909">
According to the reasons above, we propose a
system without word segmentation. Figure 2
shows the framework of our second system
based on 2-Chars&amp;&amp;3-Chars model. After
getting input sentences, system will segment
them by bigram, then the next module based on
2-Chars model will detect errors in these
segmented sentences. After error detection, a 3-
Chars model is used to correct errors by some
rules. Details of this system will be described in
the following subsections.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999968">
3.1 Bigram Segmentation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995118235294118">
A significant difference between the bigram
segmentation and the word segmentation is:
words in the sentences are non overlapping, but
bigrams are overlapping.
With respect to the sentence “全球的婦女人
口正加 quan qiu de fu nv ren kou zheng jia”, the
segmentation results of different methods are as
follows:
By word: 全球/的/婦女/人口/正/加
By bigram: 全球/球的/的婦/婦女/女人/人
口/口正/正加
Compared with word segmentation, it’s easier
to segment sentences by bigram, because it don’t
need any segmentation tools. In this CSC system,
all sentences will be segmented by bigram. After
segmentation, this system will detect errors in
these bigrams.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998955">
3.2 Error Detection
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999050666666667">
In this system, we build a 2-Chars Model and a
2-Chars dictionary extracted from a web training
corpus which is collected from lots of news
reports, compositions and other data on the web.
The format of words in this 2-Chars dictionary is
the same as the dictionary in the first CSC
system.
In the sentence “全球的婦女人口正加 quan
qiu de fu nv ren kou zheng jia”, “ 增 zeng” is
misspelled as “正 zheng” so the result of bigram
segmentation is: 全球/球的/的婦/婦女/女人/人
口/口正/正加.
The module of error detection gets a string
array consist of the results of segmentation. Take
the first word “全球” as an example, we call it
“Current-Word (C-Word)” and its next word “球
的” is called “Next-Word (N-Word)”. We make
a rule that if C-Word (“全球”) or N-Word (“球
的 ”) don’t exist in the 2-Chars dictionary, the
second character of C-Word “球” would be an
error.
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.991248">
170
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999012666666667">
Using the rule above, the system will find “口
正 ” isn’t exist in the 2-Chars dictionary, then
“正” is regraded as an error.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.987271">
3.3 Error Correction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999897310344827">
Like 2-Chars model, we also build a 3-Chars
model. And we edited a 3-Chars dictionary just
like 2-Chars dictionary but ignore the frequency
of a word.
The method of building a 3-Chars dictionary is
segmenting the sentences in web training corpus
by trigram. For example, “邁向充滿希望的新世
紀 mai xiang chong man xi wang de xin shi ji”
will be segmented as “邁向充/向充滿/充滿希/
滿希望/希望的/望的新/的新世/新世紀”;
Compared with the format of words in 2-Chars
dictionary, the format of 3-Chars words in the
dictionary is as follows:
邁向充 向充滿 充滿希 滿希望
希望的 望的新 的新世 新世紀
...
As shown in the module of error detection,
“正” is an error character in the word “口正” (C-
Word). We combine “口正” with its next word
“正加” (N-Word) into a new 3-Chars word “口
正加”, then the error “正” will be replaced by the
characters extracted from its confusion sets. If a
new 3-Chars word “口?加” can be found in the
3-Chars dictionary, the similar character will be
regarded as the correct one.
Table 5 shows the method of determining
whether a new word is correct or not. As shown
in this table, “口增加” do exist in the 3-Chars
dictionary, and “增” should be the correct one.

Details of the models will be discussed in the following subsections. Figure 1. Framework of CSC system based on CRF model 2.1 Word Segmentation Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is the first step for Chinese language processing. In recent years, Chinese spelling checkers have incorporated word segmentation (Chiu et al., 2013) and many word segmentation methods have been proposed. Such as support vector machine (SVM), conditional random field (CRF) and maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs), among them, CRF-based approach has been shown to be effective with very low computational complexity (Wang et al., 2013). The module word segmentation of our first CSC system uses condition random fields (CRF) approach. CRFs are a class of undirected graphical models with exponent distribution (Lafferty et al., 2001). A common used special case of CRFs is linear chain, which has a distribution of: _ _T _ P (y |x) =Z exp(E E Ak A</context>

A common used special case of CRFs is linear chain, which has a distribution of: _ _T _ P (y |x) =Z exp(E E Ak A, (yt-1, yt , x, t)) x where fk (yt-1 , yt , x, t) is a function which is usually an indicator function; Ak is the learned weight of feature fk ; and Z is the x normalization factor. The feature function actually consists of two kinds of features, that is, the feature of single state and the feature of transferring between states. In this system, we use a public tool CRF++ (Li et al., 2009) for CRF implementation and regard the PKU (Emerson, 2005) corpus as the training corpus. The process of word segmentation using CRF++ is as follows: a. Convert the simplified Chinese sentences in the PKU training corpus to traditional Chinese; b. Train the CRF++ tool; c. Segment the sentences inputted into this system. 2.2 Error Detection If there’re no misspelled words in a sentence, the sentence could be divided into serial correct words after ideal word segmentation. But if a sentence contains misspelled words, the segmentation could separate words containing misspelled character by serial single characters (Chang et al., 2013). For instance, the</context>
